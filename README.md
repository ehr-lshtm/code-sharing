This repo contains the code and data for our review of code sharing and other open science indicators in the journal pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety. 
The protocol can be found in the docs folder. The repository contains code and data to reproduce the results presented in our published paper, preprinted here: https://www.authorea.com/users/754945/articles/724813-sharing-is-caring-international-society-of-pharmacoepidemiology-review-and-recommendations-for-sharing-of-programming-code. 

Previous releases of the repository contain slides and results from a preliminary presentation at ICPE 2023, in Halifax.
