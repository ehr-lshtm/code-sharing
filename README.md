This repository contains the code and data for our review of code sharing and other open science indicators in the journal *Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety*. 
The protocol can be found in the docs folder. The repository contains code and data to reproduce the results presented in our published paper, preprinted [here](https://www.authorea.com/users/754945/articles/724813-sharing-is-caring-international-society-of-pharmacoepidemiology-review-and-recommendations-for-sharing-of-programming-code).

Previous releases of the repository contain slides and results from a preliminary presentation at ICPE 2023, in Halifax.
