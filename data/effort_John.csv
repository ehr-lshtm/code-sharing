The majority of icsrs at the netherlands pharmacovigilance centre lareb is reviewed manually to identify potential signal triggering reports (pstr) or icsrs which need further clinical assessment for other reasons. To develop a prediction model to identify icsrs that require clinical review, including pstrs. Secondly, to identify the most important features of these reports. All icsrs (n = 30 424) received by lareb between october 1, 2017 and february 26, 2021 were included. Icsrs originating from marketing authorisation holders and icsrs reported on vaccines were excluded. The outcome was defined as pstr (yes/no), where pstr 'yes' was defined as an icsr discussed at a signal detection meeting. Nineteen features were included, concerning structured information on: patients, adverse drug reactions (adr) or drugs. Data were divided into a training (70%) and test set (30%) using a stratified split to maintain the pstr/no pstr ratio. Logistic regression, elastic net logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting models were trained and tuned on a training set. Random down-sampling of negative controls was applied on the training set to adjust for the imbalanced dataset. Final models were evaluated on the test set. Model performances were assessed using the area under the curve (auc) with 95% confidence interval of a receiver operating characteristic (roc), and specificity and precision were assessed at a threshold for perfect sensitivity (100%, to not miss any pstrs). Feature importance plots were inspected and a selection of features was used to re-train and test model performances with fewer features. 1439 (4.7%) of reports were pstr. All three models performed equally with a highest auc of 0.75 (0.73-0.77). Despite moderate model performances, specificity (5%) and precision (5%) were low. Most important features were: 'absence of adr in the summary of product characteristics', 'adr reported as serious', 'adr labelled as an important medical event', 'adr reported by physician' and 'positive rechallenge'. Model performances were similar when using only nine of the most important features. We developed a prediction model with moderate performances to identify pstrs with nine commonly available features. Optimisation of the model using more icsr information (e.g., free text fields) to increase model precision is required before implementation.",36251280

However, the validity of diagnostic codes for ap is unknown. We aimed to determine the positive predictive value (ppv) of a diagnostic code-based algorithm for identifying patients with ap within the us veterans health administration and evaluate the value of adding readily available structured laboratory information. We identified patients with possible ap events first based on the presence of a single hospital discharge icd-9 or icd-10 diagnosis of ap (algorithm 1). We then expanded algorithm 1 by including relevant laboratory test results (algorithm 2). Specifically, we considered amylase or lipase serum values obtained between 2 days before admission and the end of the hospitalization. Medical records of a random sample of patients identified by the respective algorithms were reviewed by two separate gastroenterologists to adjudicate ap events. The ppv (95% confidence interval [ci]) for the algorithms were calculated. Algorithm 2, consisting of one icd-9 or icd-10 hospital discharge diagnosis of ap and the addition of lipase serum value ≥200 u/l, had a ppv 89.1% (95% ci 83.0%-95.2%), improving from the ppv of algorithm 1 (57.9% [95% ci 46.8-69.0]). An algorithm consisting of an icd-9 or icd-10 diagnosis of ap with a lipase value ≥200 u/l achieved high ppv. This simple algorithm can be readily implemented in any electronic health records (ehr) systems and could be useful for future pharmacoepidemiologic studies on ap.",36222554

We sought to characterize the frequency, severity, type, and anatomic location of tees reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) following ad.26.cov2.s. Reports of tees after ad.26.cov2.s were identified in vaers, and demographics, clinical characteristics, and relevant medical history were summarized. For a subset of reports, physicians reviewed available medical records and evaluated clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, risk factors, and treatment. The crude reporting rate of tees was estimated based on case counts in vaers and vaccine administration data. Through february 28, 2022, fda identified 3790 reports of tees after ad.26.cov2.s. Median age was 56 years, and 1938 individuals (51.1%) were female. Most reports, 2892 (76.3%), were serious, including 421 deaths. Median time to onset was 12 days post-vaccination. Obesity and ischemia were among the most commonly documented risk factors. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 150 000/μl) was documented in 63 records (11.5%) and anti-platelet 4 antibodies in 25 (4.6%). Medical review identified cases of severe clot burden (e.g., bilateral, saddle, or other massive pulmonary embolism with or without cor pulmonale; lower extremity thrombus involving the external iliac, common femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal, and gastrocnemius veins). The crude reporting rate was ~20.7 cases of tee per 100 000 doses of ad.26.cov2.s administered. Life-threatening or fatal tees have been reported after ad.26.cov2.s, including bilateral massive pulmonary embolism or other severe clot burden.",36065046

Using a two-stage cluster design, pharmacies were sampled with probabilities proportional to the volume of dispensed oas; 100 random oa prescriptions were sampled from pdmp records submitted by each pharmacy. Following recruitment, demographic information and hard-copy prescription data for sampled records were abstracted on-site. Days' supply was independently calculated by two pharmacists using a standard formula with disagreements adjudicated blindly by a third pharmacist. Adjudicated days' supply was compared with that submitted to the pdmp and classified as accurate/inaccurate. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between accuracy and prescription/practice-related factors. A total of 1281 oa prescriptions were reviewed at 13 participating pharmacies. Accuracy of reported oa days' supply was 89.85%, (95% ci: 86.90, 92.80). Factors associated with accuracy were presence of special instructions from the prescriber (or 3.13 [95% ci: 1.43, 6.82]), presence of 'as-needed' directions (or 0.29 [95% ci: 0.18, 0.47]), and billing to a third-party payer (or 1.43 [95% ci: 1.01, 2.02]). Accuracy of oa days' supply reported to the state pdmp was found to be moderately high. Certain prescription-related factors influence accuracy and should be accounted for in future studies. Patterns, including opioid 'split-billing' were identified and may impact validity of pdmp and administrative claims studies.",36053913

In contrast, observational studies associate glucosamine with significant reductions in mortality and cancer incidence. We evaluated the extent of bias, particularly selection bias, to explain these surprising beneficial effects. We searched the literature to identify all observational studies reporting on the effect of glucosamine use on major outcomes. We identified 11 observational studies, reporting a mean 16% reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [hr] 0.84, 95% ci: 0.81-0.87) with glucosamine use, as well as significant reductions in cancer incidence and other major diseases including cardiovascular, respiratory and diabetes. We show that these significant effects can result from selection bias due to collider stratification, as all studies used ""prevalent"" cohorts, where glucosamine use started before cohort entry, and where subjects agreed to join the cohorts. Our illustration of the bias using the uk biobank publication involving a half-million subjects shows how a true rate ratio of mortality of 1.0 in the population can result in a biased rate ratio of 0.82 in the prevalent cohort. The observational studies reporting significant reductions in mortality, cancer incidence and other outcomes with glucosamine were affected by selection bias from collider stratification. In the absence of properly conducted observational studies that circumvent this bias by considering ""new users"", the studies to date cannot support the prescription of this supplement as a preventive measure for mortality, cancer, and other chronic diseases.",36029480

Data generated through digital tools may be categorized as relevant to efficacy and/or safety. The enormity of these data requires the adoption of new approaches for processing and evaluation. Recognition of patterns within the safety data is vital for sponsors seeking regulatory approval for their new products. Nontraditional data sources may contain relevant safety information; early evaluation of these data will help to determine the product safety profile. Advanced technologies have allowed the development of digital tools to screen these data, which in some situations are classified as software as a medical devices and subject to clinical evaluation and post-marketing surveillance. Artificial intelligence may help to reduce or even eliminate noise from within these data, allowing safety experts to focus on the most pertinent evidence. We propose a data typology and provide considerations on how to define adverse events within different types of data, even where no human reporter exists. Proposals are made for the automation of screening processes. We consider validation aspects to support solutions that are proven to produce reliable results, and to deliver trusted outputs to stakeholders.",35996833

From the search, we conducted an initial review to rule-out duplicate entries, identify those that met inclusion criteria (i.e., had results), and exclude those that did not meet the definition of an rct. Lastly, we abstracted the demographic and clinical characteristics reported on within each rct. From the initial 43 627 manuscripts, our final eligible manuscripts consisted of 149 rcts described in 137 articles. Most of the rcts (113/149) studied potential treatments, while fewer studied vaccines (29), prophylaxis strategies (5), and interventions to prevent transmission among those infected (2). Study populations ranged from 10 to 38 206 participants (median = 100, iqr: 60-300). All 149 rcts reported on age, 147 on sex, 50 on race, and 110 on the prevalence of at least one comorbidity. No rcts reported on income, urban versus rural residence, or other indicators of socioeconomic status (ses). Limited reporting on race and other markers of ses make it difficult to draw conclusions about specific external target populations without making strong assumptions that treatment effects are homogenous. These findings highlight the need for more robust reporting on the clinical and demographic profiles of patients enrolled in covid-19 related rcts.",35996832

We performed a retrospective cohort study on electronic health record data from 117 126 veterans (mean age 49.2 years) diagnosed with back pain in 2015. We used latent class growth analysis to jointly model pain intensity (0-10 scores) and opioid prescriptions over 2 years to identify classes of individuals similar in their trajectory of pain and opioid over time. Multivariable multinomial logit models assessed sociodemographic and clinical predictors of class membership. We identified six trajectory classes: a ""no pain/no opioid"" class (22.2%), a ""mild pain/no opioid"" class (45.0%), a ""moderate pain/no opioid"" class (24.6%), a ""moderate, decreasing pain/decreasing opioid"" class (3.3%), a ""moderate pain/high opioid"" class (2.6%), and a ""moderate, increasing pain/increasing opioid"" class (2.3%). Among those in moderate pain classes, being white (vs. Non-white) and older were associated with higher odds of being prescribed opioids. Veterans with mental health diagnoses had increased odds of being in the painful classes versus ""no pain/no opioid"" class. We found distinct patterns in the long-term joint course of pain and opioid prescription in veterans with back pain. Understanding these patterns and associated predictors may help with development of targeted interventions for patients with back pain.",35996825

To describe pre- and post-stroke medication use, focusing on antithrombotic therapy and mortality risk, in individuals hospitalised for ischaemic stroke (is) in the united kingdom. Using primary care electronic health records from the united kingdom, we identified patients hospitalised for is (july 2016-september 2019) and classed them into three groups: atrial fibrillation (af) diagnosed pre-stroke, af diagnosed post-stroke, and non-af stroke (no af diagnosed pre-/post-stroke). We determined use of cardiovascular medications in the 90 days pre- and post-stroke and calculated mortality rates. There were 3201 hospitalised is cases: 76.2% non-af stroke, 15.7% af pre-stroke, and 8.1% af post-stroke. Oral anticoagulant (oac) use increased between the pre- and post-stroke periods as follows: 54.3%-78.7% (af pre-stroke group), 2.3%-84.8% (af post-stroke group), and 3.4%-7.3% (non-af stroke group). Corresponding increases in antiplatelet use were 30.8%-35.4% (af pre-stroke group) 38.5%-47.5% (af post-stroke group), and 37.5%-87.3% (non-af stroke group). Among all is cases, antihypertensive use increased from 66.8% pre-stroke to 78.8% post-stroke; statin use increased from 49.6%-85.2%. Mortality rates per 100 person-years (95% ci) were 17.30 (14.70-20.35) in the af pre-stroke group and 9.65 (8.81-10.56) among all other stroke cases.

Our aim was to describe changes in prescription drugs dispensing in the primary and outpatient sectors during the first year of the pandemic across europe. We used routine administrative data on dispensed medicines in eight european countries (five whole countries, three represented by one region each) from january 2017 to march 2021 to compare the first year of the covid-19 pandemic with the preceding 3 years. In the 10 therapeutic subgroups with the highest dispensed volumes across all countries/regions the relative changes between the covid-19 period and the year before were mostly of a magnitude similar to changes between previous periods. However, for drugs for obstructive airway diseases the changes in the covid-19 period were stronger in several countries/regions. In all countries/regions a decrease in dispensed ddds of antibiotics for systemic use (from -39.4% in romagna to -14.2% in scotland) and nasal preparations (from -34.4% in lithuania to -5.7% in sweden) was observed. We observed a stockpiling effect in the total market in march 2020 in six countries/regions. In czechia the observed increase was not significant and in slovenia volumes increased only after the end of the first lockdown. We found an increase in average therapeutic quantity per pack dispensed, which, however, exceeded 5% only in slovenia, germany, and czechia. The findings from this first european cross-national comparison show a substantial decrease in dispensed volumes of antibiotics for systemic use in all countries/regions. The results also indicate that the provision of medicines for common chronic conditions was mostly resilient to challenges faced during the pandemic. However, there were notable differences between the countries/regions for some therapeutic areas.",35791700

This study examined whether these differences in the advisories had different age- and sex-based impacts in each country. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare pioglitazone use (prescriptions/100000 population) in australia and the united kingdom for the 24 months before and 11 months after the july 2011 safety advisories (study period july 2009-june 2012). Separate models were used to compare use by sex and age group (≥65 years vs. <65 years) in each country. Pioglitazone use fell in australia (17%) and the united kingdom (24%) following the safety advisories. Use of pioglitazone fell more for males (18%) than females (16%) in australia, and more for females (25%) than males (23%) in the united kingdom; however, neither difference was statistically significant (australia p = 0.445, united kingdom p = 0.462). Pioglitazone use fell to a similar extent among older people than younger people in the united kingdom (23% vs. 26%, p = 0.354), and did not differ between age groups in australia (both 18%, p = 0.772). The results indicate that differences in the australian and uk safety advisories resulted in substantial reductions in pioglitazone use at the population level in both countries, however, differences by sub-groups were not observed.",35790047

A targeted literature review was performed to inform the development of 10 code-based algorithms to identify utis consisting of combinations of diagnosis codes, antibiotic exposure for the treatment of utis, and/or ordering of a urinalysis or urine culture. For each database, a probabilistic gold standard was developed using phevaluator. The performance characteristics of each code-based algorithm were assessed compared with the probabilistic gold standard. A total of 2 950 641, 1 831 405, and 2 294 929 patients meeting study criteria were identified in each database. Overall, the code-based algorithm requiring a primary uti diagnosis code achieved the highest positive predictive values (ppv; >93.8%) but the lowest sensitivities (<12.9%). Algorithms requiring three uti diagnosis codes achieved similar ppv (>0.899%) and improved sensitivity (<41.6%). Algorithms requiring a single uti diagnosis code in any position achieved the highest sensitivities (>72.1%) alongside a slight reduction in ppvs (<78.3%). All-time prevalence estimates of uti ranged from 21.6% to 48.6%. Based on these findings, we recommend use of algorithms requiring a single uti diagnosis code, which achieved high sensitivity and ppv.

The unstructured format and sheer volume of these data often render them neglected. Structural topic modelling (stm) represents a potentially insightful way of harnessing these valuable data and to detect grouping or themes in spontaneous reports to aid signal detection. This was an explorative study of the potential for structural topic modelling to identify useful patterns in adr reports involving opioid drugs in a pharmacovigilance database. A dataset of adr reports on opioid drugs reported to the netherlands pharmacovigilance centre lareb from 1991 to december 2020 was used, comprising a total of 3069 unique reports. Qualitative text analysis was combined with stm, an automated text analysis method, to examine these data. In reports submitted directly by patients and healthcare professionals, 11 meaningful topics were identified, whereby patient experience reports, particularly in relation to pain (relief), and the timing of intake and adrs of tramadol and paracetamol, were the most common. Of the 12 topics identified in reports received via marketing authorization holders, patch and skin-related side effects, addiction and constipation were the most prevalent. The stm-based analysis identified information that cannot always be captured by coding with the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra®).

This study evaluated the risk of volume depletion following concomitant use of sglt2is and loop diuretics in veterans. Veterans with t2dm were included if they received concomitant loop diuretics and sglt2is and experienced at least one volume depletion event between december 2012 and december 2019, utilizing a self-controlled case series design. Concomitant prescribing periods were divided into focal windows of 1 to 14 days, 14 to 28 days, and greater than 28 days. Incidence rate ratios (irr) were estimated using multivariable poisson regressions adjusted for age and renal function. 3352 patients experienced at least one volume depletion event and were concomitantly prescribed sglt2is and loop diuretics at least once. The risk of volume depletion increased in the treatment versus control windows during the 1 to 14-day window (irr = 1.82, 95% ci 1.63-2.02) the 15-to-28-day window (irr = 1.46, 95% ci 1.28-1.67), and the greater than 28-day window (irr = 1.22, 95% ci 1.21-1.34). Concomitant prescribing of sglt2is and loop diuretics is associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, an effect that attenuates with longer therapy durations. Prescribers need to closely monitor fluid status in patients receiving concomitant therapy, especially those with advancing age or with egfr below 60.",35713292

We aimed to separately assess the role of effects of the antidepressants and anxiolytic and the underlying illness, controlled by potential confounding associated with miscarriage onset. We used data from a validated pregnant cohort aged 15-49 years from 2002 to 2016 using bifap database. All confirmed miscarriages were used to perform a nested control analysis using conditional logistic regression. Women were classified according to use of each drug of interest into four mutually exclusive groups: nonusers, users only during prepregnancy, continuers, and initiators during first trimester. Adjusted odds ratios (aors) for major confounders during pregnancy such as number of visits to primary care practitioners visits, obesity, smoking, hta, diabetes with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Compared with nonusers, antidepressants continuers had the highest increased risk of miscarriage aor (95%) of 1.29 (1.13-1.46), being continuers of paroxetine and fluoxetine the antidepressants with the strongest association. Likewise, continuers of anxiolytics and initiators showed an increased risk of 1.19 (1.04-1.37) and 1.30 (1.13-1.50). When separating the effect between the condition itself or the treatment, women exposed during first trimester, regardless treatment duration and/or the underlying illness, had the highest risk 1.27 (1.08-1.51) for antidepressants and 1.25 (1.13-1.39) for anxiolytics. Our analysis showed an association between prenatal exposure to antidepressants and anxiolytics and miscarriage onset after controlling by potential confounding adjusting for confounders and the underlying illness.

This was a retrospective cohort study using data from iqvia medical research data (imrd)-uk data. Data from general practices in imrd-uk between january 2008 and december 2017 were used for this study. The overall rates of antidepressant prescribing were stable over the study period. The rate of initiation of antidepressant medication in people with type 2 diabetes was 22.93 per 1000 person years at risk (pyar) with a 95%ci 22.48 to 23.39 compared to 16.89 per 1000 pyar (95%ci 16.77 to 17.01) in an age and gender matched cohort. The risk of being prescribed antidepressant medication with age had a u-shaped distribution with the lowest risk in the 65-69 age group. The peak age for antidepressant initiation in men and women was 40-44, with a rate in men of 32.78 per 1000 pyar (95% ci 29.57 to 36.34) and a rate in women of 46.80 per 1000 pyar (95% ci 41.90 to 52.26).

The purpose of this study was to develop a process that uses z3a codes to identify pregnancies, pregnancy periods, and links infants within a commercial health insurance claims database. We identified pregnancies, gestation periods, pregnancy outcomes, and linked infants within the us-based optum research database between 2015 and 2020 via a series of algorithms utilizing diagnosis and procedure codes on claims.

Antimuscarinics are the backbone of the pharmacological management of overactive bladder. However, the safety profiles of antimuscarinics vary because of their dissimilarities to muscarinic receptor-subtype affinities and are associated with differential central anticholinergic adverse effects. This study aimed to examine delirium risk in new users of oxybutynin and solifenacin in older adults (≥ 65 years). In the secondary analyses, we examined the risk of delirium by type and dose of antimuscarinic. We applied a case-time-control design to investigate delirium risk in older adults who started taking oxybutynin and solifenacin. We used a nationwide inpatient hospital data (2005-2016), national minimum data set, maintained by the ministry of health, new zealand (nz), to identify older adults with a new-onset diagnosis of delirium. Eligible patients were older adults aged 65 at entry into the cohort on 1/1/2006. We used dispensing claims data to determine antimuscarinic treatment exposure. The antimuscarinic included in the study were new users of oxybutynin and solifenacin. These two antimuscarinics are subsidised by the pharmaceutical management agency and are the most frequently used antimuscarinic in nz. A conditional logistic regression model was used to compute matched odds ratios (mors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). In the case-time-control design, we made separate analyses to evaluate the dose-response risk of delirium. We identified 4818 individuals (mean age 82.14) from 2005 to 2015 with incident delirium and were exposed to at least one of the antimuscarinic of interest. The case-time-control matched odds ratio (mor) for delirium with oxybutynin was (2.06, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.07-3.96). Solifenacin was not associated with delirium (0.89 95%ci 0.64-1.23). In the sensitivity analyses, the case-time-control mor for delirium using a shorter risk period (0-3 days) did not change the results. The dose-response risk of delirium was significant for oxybutynin (0.05, 95%ci 0.02-0.08) but not for solifenacin (-0.01, 95%ci -0.03 to 0.00). In addition, in the subgroup analyses, a statistically significant association of delirium was found for oxybutynin but not for solifenacin in the non-dementia cohort (2.11,95% ci 1.08-4.13) and the dementia cohort (1.25, 95%ci 0.05-26.9). The study found that oxybutynin but not solifenacin is associated with a risk of new-onset delirium in older adults. The higher blockade of m1 and m2 receptors by oxybutynin is likely to contribute to delirium than solifenacin, which is highly selective for the m3 receptor subtype. Therefore, the treatment choice with an m3 selective agent must be given due consideration, particularly in those with pre-existing cognitive impairment.",35587029

Drug utilization was characterized based on medication order dates in the ehr, and prescription fill dates in medicare claims. We compared opioid use documented in ehr orders to prescription claims in four time periods: 1) baseline (182 days before surgery); 2) perioperative period; 3) discharge date; 4) follow-up (90 days after surgery). We identified 11 128 patients undergoing surgery. During baseline, 34.4% (ehr) versus 44.1% (claims) had evidence of opioid use, and 56.9% of all baseline use was reflected only in one data source. During the perioperative period, 78.8% (ehr) versus 47.6% (claims) had evidence of use.

When characterizing opioid exposure, we found substantial discrepancies between ehr medication orders and prescription claims data. In all time periods assessed, most patients' use was reflected only in the ehr, or only in the claims, not both.

Using healthverity chargemaster and claims data, we selected patients hospitalized with covid-19 between april 2020 and february 2021, and classified them by severity at admission using an algorithm we developed based on respiratory support requirements (supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, o2/niv, invasive mechanical ventilation, imv, or neither). To evaluate the utility of the algorithm, patients were followed from admission until death, discharge, or a 28-day maximum to report mortality risks and rates overall and by stratified by severity. Trends for heterogeneity in mortality risk and rate across severity classifications were evaluated using cochran-armitage and logrank trend tests, respectively. Among 118 117 patients, the algorithm categorized patients in increasing severity as neither (36.7%), o2/niv (54.3%), and imv (9.0%). Associated mortality risk (and 95% ci) was 11.8% (11.6-12.0%) overall and increased with severity [3.4% (3.2-3.5%), 11.5% (11.3-11.8%), 47.3% (46.3-48.2%); p < 0.001].

It is important to prioritise critical product defects for review to ensure that prompt risk mitigation actions are taken. A regulatory risk impact prioritisation model for product defects (rismed) with 11 factors considering the seriousness and extent of impact of a defect was developed. The model generated an overall score that categorised cases into high, medium or low impact. The model was further developed into a statistical risk scoring model (stat-rismed) using multivariate logistic regression that classified cases into high and non-high impact. Both models were evaluated against an expert-derived gold standard annotation corpus and tested on an independent dataset. Product defect cases received from january 2011 to june 2020 (n = 660) were used to train stat-rismed and cases from july 2020 to june 2021 (n = 220) for validation. The stat-rismed identified four factors associated with high impact cases, namely defect classification based on meddra-hsa terms, therapeutic indication of product, detectability of defect and whether any overseas regulatory actions were performed. Compared to rismed, stat-rismed achieved an improved sensitivity (94% vs 42%) and positive predictive value (47% vs 43%) for the identification of high impact cases, against the gold standard labels. This study reported characteristics that predicts cases with high impact, and the use of a statistical model to identify such cases.

We focused on evidence from a literature review covering 2013 through 2019. We identified 30 studies evaluating opioid analgesic thresholds based on federal policies and guidelines, state laws, and medicaid state plans that attempt to influence the course of patient care at or when the limit is exceeded (e.g., prior authorization). Most studies evaluated changes in prescribing or dispensing patterns of opioid analgesics, largely finding decreases in prescribing after policy enactment. Fewer studies evaluated patient or public health outcomes beyond changes in prescribing and dispensing patterns; results were infrequently stratified by potentially important sociodemographic and clinical factors. No studies assessed the potential for adverse patient outcomes for which we have emerging evidence of harms. We describe knowledge gaps and propose opportunities for future research to sufficiently assess the potential impact and unintended consequences of opioid analgesic prescribing laws, regulations, guidelines, and policies.",35247021

We illustrate reporting tools, graphical displays and sensitivity analyses to increase transparency and facilitate evaluation of the robustness of analyses involving hdps. Using a study from the uk clinical practice research datalink that implemented hdps we demonstrate the application of the proposed recommendations. We identify seven considerations surrounding the implementation of hdps, such as the identification of data dimensions, method for code prioritisation and number of variables selected. Graphical diagnostic tools include assessing the balance of key confounders before and after adjusting for empirically selected hdps covariates and the identification of potentially influential covariates. Sensitivity analyses include varying the number of covariates selected and assessing the impact of covariates behaving empirically as instrumental variables. In our example, results were robust to both the number of covariates selected and the inclusion of potentially influential covariates. Furthermore, our hdps models achieved good balance in key confounders. The data-adaptive approach of hdps and the resulting benefits have led to its popularity as a method for confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiological studies.

This study used administrative claims data from the us during 2009-2019 to identify women age 15-44 with ms and continuous insurance coverage for ≥12 months. Dmts were identified using prescription fills and procedural claims for alemtuzumab, daclizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, glatiramer acetate, interferon beta, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and teriflunomide. Monthly prevalent use was defined as ≥1 days' supply of a dmt in the month. Age- and region-standardized monthly prevalence was estimated nonparametrically. Among 42 281 reproductive-aged women over 818 179 person-months, dmt use increased from a minimum monthly prevalence of 49.3% (february, 2011) to a maximum of 58.7% (april, 2019). In 2010, prevalence of injectable dmts was 43.1% compared to 2.5% for oral dmts; by 2014, however, oral dmts (26.5%) surpassed injectable dmts (23.7%) as the most common route of administration. In the most recent data available (december, 2019), the most common dmts were dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, and fingolimod.

While no different from other forms of confounding in theory, confounding by indication often requires specific methods to address the bias it creates in addition to common epidemiological adjustment or restriction methods. Clinical indication influencing treatment prescription is patient-specific and complex, making it challenging to measure within nonexperimental research. Restriction of the study population to patients with the indication for treatment would effectively mitigate confounding by indication and bring about comparability between exposure and comparator populations with respect to probability of the exposure. Active comparators are often an effective practical solution to restrict the study population in this manner when indication cannot be measured accurately. This article discusses various forms of confounding by indication, the utility of active comparators for nonexperimental studies of treatment effects, and the active comparator, new user (acnu) study design to implicitly condition on indication. Considerations for selecting active comparators and conducting an acnu study design are discussed to enable increased adoption of these methods, improve quality of nonexperimental studies, and ultimately strengthen our evidence base for intended and unintended treatment effects in relevant target populations.",35019190

The benefits of sglt-2i from cardiovascular outcome trials may lead to preferential prescribing of sglt-2i to patients at high cardiovascular risk, possibly causing confounding in non-randomized studies of sglt-2i as first-line treatment. We assessed evolving imbalances in characteristics of patients starting sglt-2i versus metformin as first-line monotherapy. Using claims data from two us commercial health insurance and medicare, we identified patients with t2d aged ≥18 years (>65 years in medicare) initiating first-line sglt-2i or metformin from 2013 through 2019. Standardized differences (sds) for patient characteristics were assessed during four consecutive calendar time blocks (t1:4/2013-12/2014; t2:1/2015-6/2016; t3:7/2016-12/2017; and t4:1/2018-12/2019). We also estimated the propensity score of receiving sglt-2i versus metformin within each time block and evaluated time trends in model discrimination with c-statistics. We identified 9113 initiators of first-line sglt-2i and 810 348 initiators of first-line metformin. During t1, sglt-2i initiators were younger (sd = -0.24) and less likely to have seen cardiologists (-0.07) with a similar prevalence of cvd (0.04) compared with metformin. During t4, patients were more balanced for age (-0.01). Cardiologist visits (0.08) and cvd (0.25) became more prevalent among sglt-2i initiators. When comparing initiators of first-line sglt-2i versus metformin, imbalances in patient characteristics evolved from 2013 through 2019, particularly channeling sglt-2i to individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Evolving channeling in prescribing first-line sglt-2i should be expected and accounted for in non-randomized comparative effectiveness research.",34985178

The objective of this study was to determine the association between having a usual source of care and seasonal influenza vaccination rates among women who were pregnant between 2012 and 2016. A retrospective study was conducted using pooled data from the 2012-2016 medical expenditure panel survey. Frequencies of seasonal influenza vaccinations and other sociodemographic factors were estimated. A multivariable log-binomial regression model was used to examine the association between having a usual source of care and seasonal influenza vaccination rates. The weighted influenza vaccination rate among pregnant women was 54.5%. About one third did not have a usual source of care. The adjusted prevalence ratio of receiving an influenza vaccine for pregnant women without a usual source of care was 0.76 (95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.98). The top three main reasons for not having a usual source of care were being seldom or never sick (55.7%), not having health insurance (10.6%), and having recently moved to an area (9.9%).

Quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis to examine data from a nationwide electronic healthcare record database (bifap). Quarterly cumulative incidence of agomelatine use per 100 000 patients was calculated and the impact of four regulatory interventions was quantified. The incidence of agomelatine use decreased by 85% and 87% from first quarter 2011 to last quarter 2018 in patients below and above 75 years old, respectively. Regulatory actions taken were not associated with an immediate and significant falling level of use or slope. The incidence was less than expected 6 months after the first and third intervention for patients below and above 75 years old, and more than expected after the second and fourth intervention for both populations, though these analyses were underpowered to observe significant results. The downward trend became less pronounced, reaching a residual level of use, which remained stable in the last segment of the study period. New users of agomelatine decreased throughout the study period, starting before interventions took place. The effect of specific interventions might be masked by the progressive decrease tendency, constant over the study period. The effects of external factors that might overlap, unintended consequences, and issues concerning statistical modeling in situations where rates are already falling, should be considered when interpreting the results.",34676940

We assessed the methodological robustness using eight criteria, five based on general criteria for indicators (aire instrument) and three multimorbidity-specific criteria. Twenty-two multimorbidity measures were identified. The number of diseases they included ranged from 5 to 84 (median = 20), with 19 measures including both physical and mental conditions. Diseases were identified using icd codes extracted from inpatient and outpatient data (18/22) and sometimes including drug claims (10/22). The validation process relied mainly on the capacity of the measures to predict health outcome (5/22), or on the validation of each individual disease against a gold standard (8/22). Six multimorbidity measures met at least six of the eight robustness criteria assessed. There is significant heterogeneity among the measures used to assess multimorbidity in administrative databases, and about a third are of low to moderate quality.

This method uses the amount of drug redeemed, when available, and researcher-defined temporal gaps to fill the interval between the calculated end of coverage of a redeemed prescription and the date of redemption of the next prescription in the same treatment episode. The final scope is defining periods of continuous use of medications. There are strong pharmacological and epidemiological arguments for adding the gap at the end of each treatment episode. However, the evidence is scarce on the impact that such a practice has on measures of association. This study aims to compare the impact of adding or not adding the researcher-defined gap time to the end of a treatment episode on the incidence of drug discontinuation and the incidence rate for a simulated outcome that occurred during an observational window. Additionally, the study aims at assessing the magnitude of misclassification of exposure time between the two methods. A simulated dataset of 100 patients available in the r package adherer that contains 1080 redeemed prescriptions was used. A gap time of 90 days was used for constructing treatment episodes in an observational window of 365 days following the first redeemed prescription. Two approaches were used for defining treatment episodes that were named ""gap+"" and ""gap-"" and that respectively add and did not add the gap time at the end of a treatment episode. An outcome was simulated by using an exponential baseline hazard function with scale parameter λ = 0.5 and censoring at time t = 365 days. The incidence rate ratio for the simulated outcome between the two approaches was computed. The 100 patients were followed for a median time of 183 days (interquartile range, iqr 50-365 days) and a median time of 273 days (iqr 140-365 days), respectively using ""gap-"" and ""gap+"". During the first 100 days of the follow-up period, none of the patients was found to discontinue the treatment with the method ""gap+"" while 38 patients discontinued using the method ""gap-"". The approach ""gap+"" exerted a higher incidence rate for the simulated outcome among the exposed (0.98 events/person-years) when compared to the ""gap-"" (0.82 events/person-years) during defined periods of continuous treatment use. When comparing the two approaches and using the method ""gap-"" as the reference group, the incidence rate ratio for the simulated outcome was 1.20 (95% confidence interval: ci 0.72-2.02) among the exposed. This study showed that not adding the gap at the end of the treatment episodes leads to an overestimation of drug discontinuation, particularly at the beginning of the observational window, and an underestimation of the incidence rate of a hypothetical outcome during the period of exposure to the medication.",34611960

No antidepressant use within 1 year prior to the index prescription defined new use. Latent class growth analysis of antidepressant dosing in the 6 months after initiation defined the exposure groups.

This was a retrospective cohort study of 3657 subjects who had quit smoking with varenicline or no pharmacotherapy. We extracted health examination and medical claim data from a health insurer database for the period 2012-2015. We calculated the incremental cost-effective ratio (icer) of varenicline using actual paid medical costs for nicotine dependence and the number needed to treat to maintain smoking cessation compared with no pharmacotherapy, considering sex, age, income, and occupation. The 1- and 2-year smoking cessation maintenance rates were 69.7% and 62.4%, respectively.

A synthetic cohort study was constructed based on the proportion of exposure theoretically captured in a database (range 0.5-1.0) and the level of adherence (0.5-1.0). Three scenarios were explored: nondifferential misclassification, differential misclassification (misclassifications dependent on an unmeasured risk factor doubling the outcome risk), and nondifferential misclassification in a comparative effectiveness study (rr  and rr  both 2.0 compared to nonuse, rr  1.0). For the scenarios with nondifferential misclassification, 25% nonadherence or 25% uncaptured exposure changed the rr from 2.0 to 1.75, and 1.95, respectively. Applying different proportions of nonadherence or uncaptured use (20% vs. 40%) for subgroups with and without the risk factor, an rr of 0.95 was observed in the absence of a true effect (i.e., true rr = 1). In the comparative effectiveness study, no effect on rr was seen for different proportions of uncaptured exposure; however, different levels of nonadherence for the drugs (20% vs. 40%) led to an underestimation of rr  (0.89). All scenarios led to biased estimates, but the magnitude of the bias differed across scenarios.

Violations of this assumption are indicated by nonoverlap in the data in the sense that patients with certain covariate combinations are not observed to receive a treatment of interest, which may arise from contraindications to treatment or small sample size. In this paper, we emphasize the importance and implications of this often-overlooked assumption. Further, we elaborate on the challenges nonoverlap poses to estimation and inference and discuss previously proposed methods. We distinguish between structural and practical violations and provide insight into which methods are appropriate for each. To demonstrate alternative approaches and relevant considerations (including how overlap is defined and the target population to which results may be generalized) when addressing positivity violations, we employ an electronic health record-derived data set to assess the effects of metformin on colon cancer recurrence among diabetic patients.",34375473

A nested case-control study was performed among patients aged ≥18 years who had received hemodialysis for ≥90 days, had medicare parts a, b, and d coverage for ≥1 year, and had clinical evidence of shpt (parathyroid hormone >300 pg/ml). Cases were those who experienced death or hospitalization caused by gastrointestinal bleeding. Each case was matched to up to four controls. Exposure was measured by any cinacalcet use, current use, past use, cumulative exposure days, and cumulative dosage. Conditional logistic models were used to assess the association. Of 48 437 patients included, 2570 experienced gastrointestinal bleeding events (2498 non-fatal, 72 fatal), and 2465 (2397 non-fatal, 68 fatal) were matched to 9500 controls; 17.2% of cases and 15.8% of controls had cinacalcet exposure and 11.1% of both cases and controls had current use. The adjusted odds ratios (95% ci) of gastrointestinal bleeding for any use, current use, and past use of cinacalcet were 1.04 (0.91-1.19), 0.97 (0.83-1.13), and 1.22 (0.99-1.50), respectively, with no use as the reference.

Quarterly rates of buprenorphine diversion per 100 000 population and 100 000 prescriptions dispensed were calculated for the period 2002 through 2019. Population-based diversion rates were also calculated by u.s. Region. In total, 9670 cases of diverted buprenorphine were reported across all 50 states and the district of columbia during the study period. Buprenorphine diversion rates, per 100 000 population, were characterized by an accelerating increase over time; increases in diversion rates from 1st quarter 2002 through 4th quarter 2006 were not statistically significant, yet from 1st quarter 2007 through 4th quarter 2019, the rate of diversion cases increased by 0.0067 cases per 100 000 per quarter (p < 0.001). Buprenorphine diversion rates per 100 000 prescriptions dispensed indicated a gradual increase over time; from 3rd quarter 2010 through 4th quarter 2019, diversion rates showed a statistically significant increase of 0.28 cases (p = 0.037) per quarter on average.

However, in south africa, access to bm remains limited, hence, there is a need to develop strategies that will enable timely access to bm by all patients who need them. To develop a framework for the use of bm in south africa. Using a delphi questionnaire that was developed by integration of the opinions of newly qualified doctors (<2 years practice), prescribing specialists, and patients using bm, a delphi method was used to guide an experts' panel into consensus on the different opinions in the questionnaire, and from this, a framework for the use of bm was constructed. From the surveys, 76.2% of the newly qualified doctors and 91.7% of the prescribing specialists indicated that they had limited knowledge on the pharmacology of bm, and, respectively, 64.5% and 77.8% admitted that their knowledge on bm was not adequate for prescribing and taking care of patients on bm. Also, 58.3% and 75% of the prescribers indicated that the high cost and the tedious procurement process, respectively, were barriers of access to bm. The delphi panel reached consensus after two rounds, and the resultant framework recommends that, appropriate use of bm requires establishing guidelines for the use of bm, increasing bm content in the medical training programs and information resources used by healthcare professionals, enacting drug regulations and drug policies that will increase availability of bm, offering appropriate patient information and public engagement. The lack of knowledge on bm by health professionals, together with the high cost and a complex procurement processes are the major impediment to access to bm.

The goal of this scoping review was to evaluate how nepis are currently employed in research, identify opportunities and challenges for their broader application, and provide recommendations on their future use. The scoping review comprised a comprehensive literature review and a survey of key stakeholders. From the literature review, we identified 33 primary articles that described the use of nepis. The majority of articles (n = 19) identified issues with the quality of information in nepis compared with structured prescribing information; nine articles described the development of novel algorithms that performed well in extracting information from nepis, and five described the used of manual or simpler algorithms to extract prescribing information from nepis. A survey of 19 stakeholders indicated concerns for the quality of information in nepis and called for standardization of nepis to reduce data variability/errors. Nevertheless, stakeholders believed nepis present an opportunity to identify prescriber's intent for the prescription and to study temporal treatment patterns. In summary, nepis hold much promise for advancing the field of pharmacoepidemiology. Researchers should take advantage of addressing important questions that can be uniquely answered with nepis, but exercise caution when using this information and carefully consider the quality of the data.",34278660

This study aimed to evaluate the potential bias introduced by differential imaging assessment frequency when using electronic health record (ehr)-derived data to investigate the comparative effectiveness of cancer therapies. Using a nationwide de-identified ehr-derived database, we first analyzed imaging assessment frequency patterns in patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ansclc). We used those rwd inputs to develop a discrete event simulation model of two treatments where disease progression was the outcome and pfs was the endpoint. Using this model, we induced bias with differential imaging assessment timing and quantified its effect on observed versus true treatment effectiveness. We assessed percent bias in the estimated hazard ratio (hr). The frequency of assessments differed by cancer treatment types. In simulated comparative-effectiveness studies, pfs hrs estimated using real-world imaging assessment frequencies differed from the true hr by less than 10% in all scenarios (range: 0.4% to -9.6%). The greatest risk of biased effect estimates was found comparing treatments with widely different imaging frequencies, most exaggerated in disease settings where time to progression is very short. This study provided evidence that the frequency of imaging assessments to detect disease progression can differ by treatment type in real-world patients with cancer and may induce some bias in comparative-effectiveness studies in some situations.",34227170

Of patients with myocardial infarction who were also prescribed methylphenidate within the observation period, methylphenidate use was classified into four mutually exclusive periods by each person-day: exposed (exposed to methylphenidate), pre-exposure (prior to the first methylphenidate prescription), washout (after the end of methylphenidate treatment), and baseline (unexposed to methylphenidate). Risk of myocardial infarction among the three periods of methylphenidate use was compared to the baseline period using conditional poisson regression analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (irrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis).

We drew data on patients with ms followed from 1977 to 2014 in montréal using two sub-cohorts of subjects. A sub-cohort of patients taking interferon-beta-1a and another of patients taking amitriptyline were identified from the initial cohort. We use gbtm to identify groups of patients with homogeneous dose patterns for each of the two drugs. We compared the graphical representation obtained from the fitted values of gbtm with our proposed approach, which consisted of using step functions whose values corresponded to the mode. Differences in characteristics across groups were identified using chi-squares and analysis of variance, both weighted by the posterior probability of group membership. Seven patterns of dose were identified for interferon-beta-1a and five for amitriptyline. The graphical representations of the patterns of dose from gbtm included values outside of the prescribed doses and did not capture changes in dose as clearly as the proposed representation using step functions. Our proposed approach which is based on the mode at each visit in each pattern provides an intuitive and realistic representation of dose patterns in groups identified with gbtm.",34031946

Although medication-induced delirium in older adults is well understood, limited population-level evidence is available, particularly on combinations of medications associated with delirium in older adults. We aimed to apply association rule analysis to identify drug combinations contributing to delirium risk in adults aged 65 and older using a case-time-control design. We sourced a nationwide representative sample of new zealander's aged ≥65 years from the pharmaceutical collections and hospital discharge information. Prescription records (2005-2015) were obtained from new zealand pharmaceutical collections (pharms). Medication exposures were coded as binary variables (exposed vs. Not exposed) at the individual drug level. All medications, including antimicrobials, antihistamines, diuretics, opioids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, were considered drugs of interest. The first-time coded diagnosis of delirium was extracted from the national minimal dataset (nmds). A unique patient identifier linked the prescription dataset to the event dataset to set up a case-time-control cohort, indexed at the first delirium event. Association rules were then applied to identify frequent drug combinations in the case and the control periods (l-day with a 35-day washout period) that are statistically associated with delirium, and the association was tested by computing a time-trend adjusted matched odds-ratio (mor) and its 95% confidence interval (ci). We identified 28 503 individuals (mean age 84.1 years) from 2005 to 2015 with delirium. Our combined association rule and case-time-control analysis identified several drug classes, including antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, opioids, and diuretics associated with delirium. Our analysis also identified frequently used drug combinations that are associated with delirium. Examples include combined exposures to quetiapine and furosemide (mor = 6.17; 95%ci = [2.05-18.54]), haloperidol (mor = 4.81; 95%ci = [3.16-6.69]), combined exposures to furosemide, omeprazole, and lorazepam (mor = 3.94; 95%ci = [3.03-5.10]), and fentanyl exposure (mor = 3.46; 95%ci [2.05-9.21]).

Despite the existence of quantitative bias analysis in pharmacoepidemiologic studies, simultaneously adjusting for unmeasured and partially measured confounders is challenging in vaccine safety studies. Our objective was to develop a flexible approach for conducting sensitivity analyses of unmeasured and partially-measured confounders concurrently for a vaccine safety study. We derived conditional probabilities for an unmeasured confounder based on bias parameters, used these conditional probabilities and monte carlo simulations to impute the unmeasured confounder, and re-constructed the analytic datasets as if the unmeasured confounder had been observed. We simultaneously imputed a partially measured confounder using a prediction model. We considered unmeasured breastfeeding and partially measured family history of type 1 diabetes (t1dm) in a study examining the association between exposure to rotavirus vaccination and t1dm. Before sensitivity analyses, the hazard ratios (hr) were 1.50 (95% ci, 0.81-2.77) for those partially exposed and 1.03 (95% ci, 0.62-1.72) for those fully exposed with unexposed children as the referent group.

We conclude that adjusting for unmeasured breastfeeding and partially measured family history of t1dm did not alter the conclusion that there was no evidence of association between rotavirus vaccination and developing t1dm.

Post-operatively, over 29% of women received opioid prescriptions. Mean cumulative days of post-surgical opioid prescribing was 32.2 (sd = 43.1), and was not statistically different between groups. Thirteen percent of women were prescribed opioids for 90 days or more. Women undergoing pop with transabdominal mesh are more likely to receive prescriptions for opioids after surgery compared to transvaginal native tissue repair. Treatment plans that address pain while mitigating the risks associated with prolonged opioid prescribing should be employed.",33797822

Over more than a decade, sentinel has become an integral part of fda's surveillance capabilities and has been used to conduct analyses that have contributed to regulatory decisions. Fda's role in the covid-19 pandemic response has necessitated an expansion and enhancement of sentinel. Here we describe how the sentinel system has supported fda's response to the covid-19 pandemic. We highlight new capabilities developed, key data generated to date, and lessons learned, particularly with respect to working with inpatient electronic health record data. Early in the pandemic, sentinel developed a multi-pronged approach to support fda's anticipated data and analytic needs. It incorporated new data sources, created a rapidly refreshed database, developed protocols to assess the natural history of covid-19, validated a diagnosis-code based algorithm for identifying patients with covid-19 in administrative claims data, and coordinated with other national and international initiatives. Sentinel is poised to answer important questions about the natural history of covid-19 and is positioned to use this information to study the use, safety, and potentially the effectiveness of medical products used for covid-19 prevention and treatment.",33797815

We compared the risk of treatment failure of antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of uti in real-world practice. We identified non-pregnant, premenopausal women diagnosed with uncomplicated, lower tract uti and prescribed an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens. We used propensity score-weighted kaplan-meier functions to estimate 30-day risks and risk differences (rd) for pyelonephritis and uti-related antibiotic prescription switch. Of 1 140 602 patients, the distribution of index prescriptions was 44% fluoroquinolones (non-first-line), 28% trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx) (first-line), 24% nitrofurantoin (first-line), 3% narrow-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), 1% broad-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), and 1% amoxicillin/ampicillin (non-recommended). Compared to the risk of pyelonephritis for nitrofurantoin (0.3%), risks were higher for tmp/smx (rd, 0.2%; 95% ci, 0.2%-0.2%) and broad-spectrum β-lactams (rd, 0.2%; 95% ci, 0.1%-0.4%). Compared to the risk of prescription switch for nitrofurantoin (12.7%), the risk was higher for tmp/smx (rd 1.6%; 95% ci 1.3%-1.7%) but similar for broad-spectrum β-lactams (rd -0.7%; 95% ci -1.4%-0.1%) and narrow-spectrum β-lactams (rd -0.3%; 95% ci -0.8%-0.2%). Subgroup analyses suggest tmp/smx treatment failure may be due in part to increasing uropathogen resistance over time. The risk of treatment failure differed by antibiotic agent, with higher risk associated with tmp/smx versus nitrofurantoin, and lower or similar risk associated with broad- versus narrow-spectrum β-lactams. Given serious safety warnings for fluoroquinolones, these results suggest that nitrofurantoin may be preferable as the first-line agent for outpatient treatment of uncomplicated uti.",33783918

We estimated prescription of eight major classes of preventive drugs 1 year and 1 month before death; continuation or initiation of preventive drug use during the last month of life was also investigated. Over the last year of life, in both oncologic and non-oncologic patients, we observed a modest decrease in the prescription of blood glucose-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensives, lipid-modifying agents, and bisphosphonates, and a slight increase in the prescription of vitamins, minerals, antianemic drugs, and antithrombotic agents (among oncologic patients only). One month before death, the prescription of preventive drugs was still common, particularly for anti-hypertensives, antithrombotics, and antianemics, with more than 60% of patients continuing to be prescribed most preventive drugs and an over 10% starting a therapy with an antithrombotic, an antianemic, or a vitamin or mineral supplement.

We reviewed all health outcomes coding trends reports on the sentinel website through november 30, 2019 and analyzed trends in incidence and prevalence across the icd-9-cm and icd-10-cm eras by visual inspection. We identified 78 unique health outcomes (22 acute, 32 chronic, and 24 acute or chronic) and 140 time-series graphs of incidence and prevalence. The reports also included code lists and code mapping methods used. Of the 140 graphs reviewed, 81 (57.9%) showed consistent trends across the icd-9-cm and icd-10-cm eras, while 51 (36.4%) and 8 (5.7%) graphs showed inconsistent and uncertain trends, respectively. Chronic hois and acute/chronic hois had higher proportions of consistent trends in prevalence definitions (83.9% and 78.3%, respectively) than acute hois (28.6%).

This study analyzed 80 059 reports from the us vaers between 1990 and 2017. Several aes were identified as highly associated with gbs and were used to develop the prediction model. Some common and mild aes that were suspected to be underreported when gbs occurred simultaneously were removed from the final model. The analyses were validated using european influenza vaccine aes data from eudravigilance. Of the 80 059 reports, 1185 (1.5%) were annotated as gbs related. Twenty-four aes were identified as having strong association with gbs. The full prediction model, using age, sex, and all 24 aes achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve (auc) of 85.4% (90% ci: [83.8%, 86.9%]). After excluding the nine (e.g., pruritus, rash, injection site pain) likely underreported aes, the final auc became 77.5% (90% ci: [75.5%, 79.6%]). Two hundred and one (0.25%) reports were predicted as of high risk of gbs (predicted probability >25%) and 84 actually developed gbs.

We denote this the ""bottleneck count"" (bnc). We describe how to translate the bnc into an achievable precision and provide empirical examples. First, we derive a theoretical prediction of the precision in a study where only the bnc determines precision. As an illustration, we calculated the expected precision of a null-effect study on retinoids and peptic ulcer bleeding, expressed as the upper/lower confidence limit ratio (ulclr). Finally, we reviewed 126 effect estimates from the literature, analyzing the relationship between the predicted and achieved precision. The log-log transformed ulclr was shown to be a simple linear function of log(bnc). The expected annual number of retinoid-users experiencing a peptic ulcer bleeding was 9.8, yielding an estimated ulclr for a 1-year study of 3.84. The literature review showed an inverse linear relationship between the logarithmic bnc and the log-log transformed ulclr, which was largely independent of study design, effect measure and category of bnc. Achieved precision deviated little from predictions but was usually lower than predicted, particularly with low bnc. The precision of a study can be predicted simply and with good accuracy from the bnc, which is useful for determining whether a study is worth pursuing or not.",33480043

The number of real-world rr-lbcl patients was projected over time in a general population of 5, 15, and 25 million citizens using lymphoma registry data.

Opioid dispensing was evaluated using claims from filled prescriptions. Two different definitions of chronic opioid use were employed: ≥90 days' supply and ≥180 days' supply of prescription opioids during pregnancy. Patient characteristics were assessed and variations in the prevalence of chronic opioid therapy were described by geographic region and over time. 1.50% of 975 169 medicaid-insured and 0.32% of 1 037 599 commercially insured beneficiaries filled opioid prescriptions for ≥90 days' supply; 0.78% (medicaid) and 0.17% (commercially insured) filled prescriptions for ≥180 days' supply. Prevalence approximately doubled in medicaid beneficiaries during the study period, while it remained relatively stable for commercial insurance beneficiaries. The most commonly prescribed opioid for chronic therapy was hydrocodone, followed by oxycodone and tramadol. Indications commonly associated with chronic use were back/neck pain, abdominal/pelvic pain, musculoskeletal pain and migraine/headache. Substantial regional variation was observed, with several states reporting a frequency of ≥90 days' supply in excess of 3% in medicaid-insured patients. Despite growing awareness of the risks associated with chronic opioid use and emphasis on improving opioid prescription patterns, prevalence of chronic use in pregnancy among publicly insured women nearly doubled from 2008-2014 and was 5-fold more common when compared to commercially insured women.

The goal of this article is to provide clarity and guidance on issues related to confounding and provide motivation for using more flexible models for causal inference in pharmacoepidemiology. In this article we elucidate two important components of making valid inference from observational data: measuring the necessary set of variables at the design/data collection phase (measured confounding) and properly accounting for confounding at the modeling/analysis phase (accounted-for confounding). For the latter concept, we contrast parametric modeling approaches, which are susceptible to model misspecification bias, with data adaptive approaches. Both measuring and properly accounting for confounding is critical to obtaining valid causal inference from pharmacoepidemiology studies. Carefully thought out dags, based on subject matter knowledge, can help to better identify confounders and confounding. Even when confounding has been adequately measured, mis-specified models may lead to unaccounted for confounding and increasing the sample size often does not help. We recommend modern analytic techniques such as flexible data adaptive approaches that do not rely on strong parametric assumptions. Further, sensitivity analyses and other modern bounding approaches are recommended to account for the effects of unmeasured confounding. Confounding must be considered at both the design and analysis stages of a study. Dags and data adaptive approaches can help.",33372303

We randomly sampled 550 persons with an ap diagnosis from inpatient data or outpatient or emergency department diagnoses immediately preceding a hospitalization and 150 negative controls with a differential diagnosis (cholangitis or cholecystitis). We conducted an emr review to confirm cases of ap and used logistic regression to develop emr-based and claims-based algorithms to identify confirmed ap cases with variables typically available in electronic data sources. Algorithm performance was assessed using the c statistic, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value.

We aim to define, using real world data (rwd), a reproducible procedure that allows identification of car-t target population for dlbcl. Through the linking of electronic healthcare datasets (ehd), we identified patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl), resident in lazio region (2010-2015), aged ≥20 years. Dlbcl patients were followed using pathological anatomy (pa) reports, up to 3 years. To be defined as relapsed after two treatment lines, patients must have had new chemotherapy and/or nhl hospitalization after asct or at the end of the second chemotherapy. The incident rate of second relapse (r2-rate) was extended to the population without pa reports. Nhl incident patients were 7384, 68% presented a pa report and, 29% of these had dlbcl codes. Patients who relapsed after two treatment lines were 47 (39%) in the subgroup of patients who received asct and 138 (41%) in that with second chemotherapy treatment. Patients in the two subgroups were very different in terms of age and comorbidity. The annual incident number of dlbcl was estimated to be 329 which multiplied by r2-rate (13.7%) gives 45 patients per year eligible for car-t. This study shows how rwd allows the identification of a target population with new advanced therapies. This approach is rigorous, transparent and verifiable over time.",33108004

Adverse events are preferred terms (pts) defined in meddra. We used frequentist approaches, including the reporting odds ratio (ror) and the proportional reporting ratio (prr) to measure disproportionality.

The drug burden index (dbi), a pharmacological screening tool, measures these properties across drug classes, and higher dbi drug exposure (dbi > 1) has been associated with certain physical function-related adverse events. Our aim was to quantify mean daily dbi drug exposure among older adults in the united states (us). We screened medications for dbi properties and operationalized the dbi for us medicare claims. We then conducted a retrospective cohort study of a 20% random, nationwide sample of 4 137 384 fee-for-service medicare beneficiaries aged 66+ years (134 757 039 person-months) from january 2013 to december 2016. We measured the monthly distribution based on mean daily dbi, categorized as (a) >0 vs 0 (any use) and (b) 0, 0 < dbi ≤ 1, 1 < dbi ≤ 2, and dbi > 2, and examined temporal trends. We described patient-level factors (eg, demographics, healthcare use) associated with high (>2) vs low (0 < dbi≤1) dbi drug exposure. The distribution of the mean daily dbi, aggregated at the month-level, was: 58.1% dbi = 0, 29.0% 0 < dbi≤1, 9.3% 1 < dbi≤2, and 3.7% dbi > 2. Predictors of high monthly dbi drug exposure (dbi > 2) included certain indicators of increased healthcare use (eg, high number of drug claims), white race, younger age, frailty, and a psychosis diagnosis code. The predictors of high dbi drug exposure can inform discussions between patients and providers about medication appropriateness and potential de-prescribing.

Japanese health insurance claims and medical check-up data from october 2015 to march 2017 were analyzed to assess factors associated with target sua achievement in gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis in gout. Target sua was further assessed by subgroup analysis of urate-lowering therapy (ult) prescriptions and outcomes, stratified by renal function. Patients achieving target sua tended toward older, female, higher ult dose, higher adherence, more comorbidities, and/or antidiabetic drugs prescribed. Renal dysfunction and/or diuretic prescriptions were associated with reduced achievement of target sua. Severe renal dysfunction was particularly influential (odds ratio [or] = 0.22 [95% confidence interval (ci): 0.10-0.48] for <15, 0.15 [0.10-0.23] for ≥15 to <30, compared with egfr ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m  ). Across all renal function categories, mean prescribed ult dose was low (febuxostat 17.0-21.0 mg/day, allopurinol 123.1-139.6 mg/day), and target sua achievement was reduced among renal dysfunction patients. Gouty arthritis was more likely in patients with a prior history of such occurrences, and less likely for higher ult adherence, sua monitored regularly at medical facilities, and/or more comorbidities. In a real-world setting, severe renal dysfunction is the most important risk factor for failure to achieve the target sua, suggesting suboptimal disease management in patients with gout or hyperuricemia complicated by this condition.

Medication use among pregnant women in new south wales, australia was identified using linked perinatal and pharmaceutical dispensing data from 2006 to 2012. Medication use in women of childbearing age (including pregnant women) was identified using pharmaceutical dispensing data for a 10% random sample of the australian population. Pregnant social security beneficiaries (n = 111 612) were age-matched (1:3) to female social security beneficiaries in the 10% sample. For each medication, the risk it was dispensed during pregnancy relative to being dispensed during an equivalent time period among matched controls was computed. Medications were mapped to australian pregnancy risk categories. Of the 181 included medications, 35 were statistically significantly more commonly dispensed to pregnant women than control women. Of these, 23 are categorised as posing no increased risk to the foetus. Among medications suspected of causing harm or having insufficient safety data, the strongest associations were observed for hydralazine, ondansetron, dalteparin sodium and ranitidine. Use was less likely during pregnancy than control periods for 127 medications, with the strongest associations observed for hormonal contraceptives and progestogens.

By updating an earlier systematic review, we summarize modern statistical best practices for evaluating and correcting for potential bias due to unmeasured confounding in estimating causal treatment effect from non-interventional studies. We suggest a hierarchical structure for assessing unmeasured confounding. First, for initial sensitivity analyses, we strongly recommend applying a recently developed method, the e-value, that is straightforward to apply and does not require prior knowledge or assumptions about the unmeasured confounder(s). When some such knowledge is available, the e-value could be supplemented by the rule-out or array method at this step. If these initial analyses suggest results may not be robust to unmeasured confounding, subsequent analyses could be conducted using more specialized statistical methods, which we categorize based on whether they require access to external data on the suspected unmeasured confounder(s), internal data, or no data. Other factors for choosing the subsequent sensitivity analysis methods are also introduced and discussed, including the types of unmeasured confounders and whether the subsequent sensitivity analysis is intended to provide a corrected causal treatment effect. Various analytical methods have been proposed to address unmeasured confounding, but little research has discussed a structured approach to select appropriate methods in practice. In providing practical suggestions for choosing appropriate initial and, potentially, more specialized subsequent sensitivity analyses, we hope to facilitate the widespread reporting of such sensitivity analyses in non-interventional studies.

Recent examples include the approval of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy for male breast cancer and the inclusion of rwe in the label of paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia. This interest has created an urgency to develop processes that promote trust in the evidence-generation process. Key stakeholders and decision-makers include patients and their healthcare providers; learning health systems; health technology assessment bodies and payers; pharmacoepidemiologists and other clinical reseachers, and policy makers interested in bioethical and regulatory issues. A key to optimal uptake of rwe is transparency of the research process to enable decision-makers to evaluate the quality of the methods used and the applicability of the evidence that results from the rwe studies. Registration of rwe studies-particularly for hypothesis evaluating treatment effectiveness (hete) studies-has been proposed to improve transparency, trust, and research replicability. Although registration would not guarantee better rwe studies would be conducted, it would encourage the prospective disclosure of study plans, timing, and rationale for modifications. A joint task force of the international society for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research (ispor) and the international society for pharmacoepidemiology (ispe) recommended that investigators preregister their rwe studies and post their study protocols in a publicly available forum before starting studies to reduce publication bias and improve the transparency of research methods.

In the nested case-control study, while the risk of cardiovascular events was increased with domperidone (or 1.38, 95% ci 1.28-1.47) compared to non-use, the risk was reduced (0.64, 0.57-0.72) compared to metoclopramide. In the case-time-control study, similar increased risk was found when compared to non-use (1.40, 1.29-1.52) but a reduced risk as compared with metoclopramide (0.63, 0.54-0.72). Risk of myocardial infarction associated with domperidone was highest (nested case-control: 1.94, 1.33-2.83; case-time-control: 1.91, 1.01-3.62) when compared to non-use but did not indicate an increased risk when compared to metoclopramide (nested case-control: 0.60, 0.32-1.13; case-time-control: 0.70, 0.25-1.98). Our findings support a positive association between domperidone and adverse cardiovascular events. However, domperidone may have a safer cardiovascular profile than metoclopramide.",32869447

We aimed to understand current practice in addressing this bias in pharmacoepidemiology database studies and to develop an open source application (app) from existing methodology to demonstrate the impact and mechanism of this bias on results. Studies of an exposure and a clinical outcome were selected from all pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety publications during 2017 and any reference to outcome misclassification described. An app to correct risk ratio (rr) and cumulative incidence for outcome misclassification was developed from a published methodology and used to demonstrate the impact of correction on point estimates. Eight (19%) of 43 papers selected reported estimates of outcome ascertainment accuracy with positive predictive value (ppv) the most commonly reported measure (7 of 8 studies). Three studies (7%) corrected for the bias, 1 by exposure strata, and 5 (12%) restricted analyses to confirmed cases. The app (app http://apps.p-95.com/ispe/) uses values of ppv and sensitivity (or a range of possible values) in each exposure strata and returns corrected point estimates and confidence intervals. The app demonstrates that small differences between comparison groups in ppv or sensitivity can introduce bias even when accuracy estimates are high. Outcome misclassification is not usually corrected in pharmacoepidemiology database studies although correction methods using routinely measured indices are available. Error indices are needed for each comparison group to correct rr estimates for these errors. The app should encourage understanding of this bias and increase adjustment.",32860317

Retrospective cohort study of medicare claims for 71 688 individuals who used bam drugs during 2007-2009 without an adrd diagnosis. We compared adrd incidence (2011-2016) between non-selective bam users (fesoterodine, flavoxate, oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium) and m3-selective bam users (darifenacin, solifenacin). Logistic regressions compared individuals using target drugs in the same category of total standardized daily doses (tsdd) as a standardized measure of drug exposure, and adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, healthcare utilization, other medication use, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. Secondary analyses compared adrd risk associated with different doses of bams overall. Non-selective bam use (compared to m3-selective) was not significantly associated with adrd incidence.

Detailed analysis of patient (sex, age) and report (year of report; reporter: healthcare worker vs consumer) characteristics were conducted using reports from 2004 quarter 1 to 2018 quarter 4. Reporting odds ratios and confidence intervals (rors,ci) were calculated. Of the 1 916 674 adr reports, 300 985 indicated opioids as the primary medication. There was a surge in opioid-related adrs reported in 2018 with six times more reports compared to 2004 and twice the number of reports compared to 2017. The largest ror among the 20 common adrs was depression and suicide-self-injury (ror 3.12, 95% ci 3.01-3.22) for reports in age group ≥65 compared to age group 18 to 64, and lack of efficacy (ror 6.80, 95% ci 6.61-7.00) for males compared to females.

We categorized patients into four mutually exclusive groups based on the trajectory of opioid use in the year after cot: abrupt discontinuation, dose reduction and discontinuation, dose reduction without discontinuation, and stable or increasing dose. Finally, we examined prescription patterns in each category. Among individuals with high-dose cot, 7636 (37.1%) had an abrupt discontinuation, 2577 (12.5%) had a dose reduction and discontinuation, 7739 (37.6%) had a dose reduction without discontinuation, and 2623 (12.8%) had a stable or increasing dose in the year following the cot episode. Among those who discontinued opioid use (n = 10 213, 49.6%), three in four (74.8%) did so without evidence of tapering. Patients who discontinued opioid use were younger, had higher daily mme during cot, and were more likely to have filled a benzodiazepine or had a multiple provider or multiple pharmacy episode compared to patients who did not discontinue opioid use. Dose reductions and discontinuations after a cot episode can be identified in large administrative datasets. Those with a discontinuation were more likely to have riskier prescription profiles during their cot episode.",32844498

Patients aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with nsclc and exposed to pembrolizumab, between 23 june 2016 and 31 october 2018, as second or later lines of treatment for advanced disease were included. Patients were followed-up until death or cut-off date (30 april 2019). Primary outcome was overall survival (os). Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (pfs), event-free survival (efs), and adverse events (aes) leading to treatment discontinuation. The efficacy-effectiveness gap was evaluated comparing results with clinical trial data. A total of 181 patients were included. Median age was 63 years (range 33-94); 74.6% were male. Median treatment duration was 5.6 months (interquartile range: 1.4-10.4) and, at cut-off date, treatment had been discontinued in 141 patients, mainly due to disease progression.

We evaluated whether various machine learning methods can be used for estimating conditional means of the potential outcomes to enhance the robustness of the doubly robust estimator to various degrees of model misspecification in terms of reducing bias and standard error. We considered four types of methods to predict the outcomes: least squares, tree-based methods, generalized additive models and shrinkage methods. We also considered an ensemble method called the super learner (sl), which is a linear combination of multiple learners. We conducted simulations considering different scenarios by the complexity of ps and outcome-generating models and some ranges of treatment prevalence. The shrinkage methods performed well with robust doubly robust estimates in term of bias and mean squared error across the scenarios when the models became rich by including all 2-way interactions of the covariates. The sl performed similarly to the best method in each scenario.

We aimed to evaluate the extent and magnitude of bias in case-crossover analyses of chronic and persistent exposures, using simulations. We simulated cohorts with either 30-day, 180-day, or 2-year exposure duration; and with varying degrees of persistence (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 90% of patients not stopping exposure). We evaluated all scenarios under the null and the scenario with 30% persistence under varying exposure effects (odds ratios of 0.25 to 4.0). Cohorts were analyzed using conditional logistic regression that compared the odds of exposure on the outcome day to the odds of exposure on a referent day 30 days prior to the outcome. We further implemented the case-time-control design to evaluate its ability to adjust for bias from persistence. Case-crossover analyses produced unbiased estimates across all scenarios without persistent users, regardless of exposure duration. In scenarios where some patients persisted on treatment, case-crossover analyses resulted in upward bias, which increased with increasing proportion of persistent users, but did not vary substantially in relation to the magnitude of the true effect. Case-time-control analyses removed bias in all scenarios. Investigators should be aware of bias due to treatment persistence in unidirectional case-crossover analyses of chronic medications, which can be remedied with a control group of similarly persistent noncases.",32548875

We conducted a rapid monitoring analysis to evaluate changes in health services utilization three months after the policy was introduced compared with a three-year period before the policy's introduction. Using the administrative claims data of the british columbia ministry of health, we assembled three historical cohorts and one policy cohort of users of each originator drug (8 cohorts in total). Cumulative incidences of medication refills, switching, and visits to physicians were the outcome measures used to compare policy and historical cohorts. Likelihood ratios were used to quantify statistical differences between each policy cohort and its respective historical controls.

A case/non-case approach was used to evaluate the association between several pregnancy-related adrs and clozapine exposure during pregnancy, using 2×2 contingency tables to investigate disproportionality and standard meddra queries to select cases. Clozapine exposure was defined as all icsr-adr combinations with clozapine as (one of) the suspected drug(s). Non-exposure was defined as all icsr-adr combinations with oap as (one of) the suspected drug(s).

Overall, no signal of disproportionate reporting associating clozapine with the studied adverse pregnancy outcomes was found compared with oap exposure. Based on global pharmacovigilance data, we did not find any evidence that clozapine is less safe during pregnancy than oap. Although this is not automatically equivalent to the relative safety of clozapine during pregnancy, these findings add to the convergence of proofs to allow final conclusions and decisions regarding the treatment of pregnant women with clozapine.",32378285

We use the truven health marketscan claims database to assess persistence for six drugs: adalimumab, apremilast, etanercept, ixekizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab. We define the permissible gap in three ways: 150 days for ustekinumab and 90 days for all other drugs (150/90 model); 120 days for all drugs (120 model); and twice the days' supply for all drugs (days' supply model). To estimate unadjusted persistence, we use kaplan-meier curves, and a proportional hazards model to estimate the adjusted risk of non-persistence. Ustekinumab is most sensitive to changes in the definition of permissible gap, likely because of its longer maintenance dosing interval. Among targeted drug-experienced patients using ustekinumab, median persistence is 358 days (95% confidence interval: 343-371) in the 150/90 model and 189 days (179-199) in the days' supply model. Among targeted drug-experienced patients, median persistence in the days' supply model is longest for ixekizumab and secukinumab at 252 (217-301) and 222 (210-244) days, respectively.

In the secondary analyses, we examined the risk of parkinsonism by type and dose of sga and conducted age-sex interactions. This population-based study included older adults who had a new-onset diagnosis of parkinsonism and who started taking olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine between 1 january 2005, and 30 december 2016. The cox proportional hazard (coxph) model with inverse probability treatment weighted (iptw) covariates was used to evaluate the risk of new-onset parkinsonism associated with sgas, using quetiapine as the reference. We used the generalized propensity score method to evaluate the dose-response risk of parkinsonism associated with sgas. After iptw adjustment for covariates, the coxph model showed that compared to quetiapine, the use of olanzapine and risperidone were associated with an increased risk of parkinsonism. The iptw-hazard ratios are 1.76 (95% confidence interval 1.57-1.97) and 1.31 (95%ci 1.16-1.49), respectively. The dose-response risk of parkinsonism was highest for olanzapine with a hazard ratio of 1.69 (95%ci 1.40-2.05) and the least for quetiapine with a hazard ratio of 1.22 (95%ci 1.14-1.31). The risk of parkinsonism in the 65 to 74-year age group was higher for both sexes with risperidone compared to olanzapine, but the risk increased with olanzapine for both sexes in the 85+ age group.

We enrolled 130 participants (c¯x = 58 ± 10.7 years of age, 38% female, 45% black) from two hospitals. Patients were eligible if they owned a smartphone and were admitted to the hospital for acs, prescribed aspirin at discharge, and responsible for administering their own medications. Consenting participants were randomized to the intervention or usual care group. The intervention group was eligible to receive up to $50 per month if they took their medicine daily, with $2 per day deducted if a dose was missed. All participants received an electronic monitoring (em) pill bottle containing a 90-day supply of aspirin, which was used to measure adherence calculated as the proportion of prescribed drug taken using the em device. Based on the skewness in the adherence distribution, quantile regression was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on median adherence over time. After 90 days, adherence fell in the control group but remained high in the intervention group (median adherence 81% vs 90%, p = .18). Rehospitalization was higher in the control group (24% vs 13%, p = .17).

Data were drawn from wave 2 (2013/2014) of the intellectual disability supplement to the irish longitudinal study on ageing (ids-tilda), a nationally representative study of older adults with id in ireland. A modified version of fried's frailty phenotype was constructed. Drug burden measures were polypharmacy, drug burden index (dbi), anticholinergic cognitive burden (acb) and sedative load model. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and identify associations between frailty and drug burden. This study included 570 participants with id.

This review synthesizes the current literature on medical device surveillance signal detection and provides a framework for application of methods to active surveillance of spontaneous reports. Ovid medline, ovid embase, scopus, and pubmed databases were systematically searched up to january 2019. Additionally, five methods articles from pharmacovigilance were added that had potential applications to medical devices. Among 105 articles included, the most common source of data (84%) was registries; median time between data collection and publication was 8 years. Surgical procedure outcome signal detection articles comprised 83% while 14% were on device outcome signal detection. The most common family of methods cited (70%) was sequential probability ratio. Application of any signal detection algorithm requires careful consideration of influential factors, data limitations, and algorithmic assumptions. We recommend approaches using disproportionality, statistical process control, and sequential probability tests and provide r packages to further development efforts. The small number of published examples suggest that further development of statistical methods and technological solutions to analyze large amounts of data for device safety and performance is needed.

We examined psychostimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiepileptics (aeds; separated by use for epilepsy or other indications). We used relative measures (%) to compare model coefficients. We also compared number of pregnancies defined as exposed when the earliest fill considered was 30 days before the last menstrual period (lmp -30 days), lmp, or estimated conception date (lmp +14 days). We observed a sudden decline in prescription fills from 2 weeks after conception and decreasing fills thereafter for psychostimulants, antidepressants, aeds for other indications, and antipsychotics excluding incident users. Fills for aeds for epilepsy did not fall after conception. Only 77% of pregnancies with fills for psychostimulants from lmp and 58% with fills from lmp -30 days had fills from conception. Similar figures for aeds for epilepsy were 99% and 96%.

The proportion of each ca in women taking a specific medication was compared with the proportion of that ca in all other women in the dataset (55 cas × 523 medications). Bhms were grouped by either medications or cas or by both simultaneously, and the results compared with analysing each medication-ca combination separately and adjusting for multiplicity using a double false discovery rate (fdr) procedure. The proportions of ""high-risk"" medications (medications which have been shown to carry a moderate to high risk of foetal malformations) identified as potential signals were compared, as well as the total number of potential signals requiring follow up (the effective workload). Bhms identified more high-risk medications than the double fdr method, but the effective workload was larger.

In japan, approximately 88.8% of patients with ntm suffer from mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (mac) lung disease. Incidence of mac lung disease is increasing in particularly among the middle-aged and elderly women owing to a rapid increase in nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. General treatment for mac lung disease is chemotherapy. The type of chemotherapy recommended by specialists to prevent the development of a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria consists of a combination of clarithromycin (cam), rifampicin, and ethambutol (eb). Cam monotherapy is contraindicated by specialists owing to its high potential to induce drug-resistant bacterial strains in patients with mac lung disease. In addition, administering eb at doses not less than 1000 mg d  is not recommended to avoid adverse drug reactions. However, it is unclear how much such treatment cases exist in real world clinical settings. This is because no long-term investigation has been carried out. This study investigated treatment with these drugs from 2005 to 2017, by studying 1135 patients with mac lung disease based on health insurance claims database. Results showed that approximately 9.2% (101 cases) were prescribed long-term cam monotherapy for 3 months or longer and approximately 3.6% (18 cases) were prescribed high doses of eb. Cam monotherapy over a long period of time is potentially detrimental to some patients.

We evaluated pharmaceutically treated comorbid conditions (ccs) and costs (12 months after index prescription) of patients using triptan. Multivariable linear regression models with log-transformed outcomes were performed to identify the factors related to healthcare costs. From a total of 749 092, we identified 10,090 patients using triptans (1-year prevalence of 1.35%), whereas 58.9% had ≥2 ccs.

Our objective was to adapt the hdps algorithm to allow for the inclusion of multilevel treatments and compare estimates obtained via this approach with those obtained via pairwise comparisons in a case study using real-world data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cardiovascular events associated with three smoking cessation drugs (varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy [nrt]) using the clinical practice research datalink. We applied the binary hdps algorithm adjusted for pre-specified and empirically-selected covariates to cohorts formed by each treatment pair. We then constructed multinomial hdps models on a cohort of new users of any of the three drugs, adjusting for predefined covariates and different combinations of empirically-selected covariates. After trimming the area of non-overlap of the hdps distributions, the effects of the study drugs on cardiovascular events were estimated with the cox proportional hazards models adjusted for propensity score category. Outcome models adjusted for multinomial hdps estimated treatment effects that were slightly more protective than those estimated in pairwise comparisons (varenicline vs nrt: hr  = 0.60-0.62, hr  = 0.64; bupropion vs nrt: hr  = 0.70-0.72, hr  = 0.76).

The completeness and accuracy of pin were respectively calculated as the percentage of abc records coexisting (concordant) in pin and the percentage of concordant records having mutually agreeable information on drug quantity. Generalized linear models were used to examine potential association of pin completeness and accuracy with sociodemographic factors. A total of 1 218 191 drug prescription records from 13 143 atp participants were captured by pin and abc in 2008-2015, among which 91.6% were from pin, 82.5% from abc, and 74.2% coexisted in pin and abc. The overall completeness of pin in capturing abc medication records was 89.9%, with small variations (less than ±5%) across types of drugs. The completeness of pin was improved on average by 1.3% annually over time (p < .001). Pin had 100% accuracy as defined by drug quantity data agreeable with abc records. No significant associations were observed with age, sex, ethnicity, rural/urban areas, and socioeconomic status of the participants. Cross-validated with the abc dataset, our study showed that irrespective of drug type, pin has a fairly good completeness (approximately 90%) and accuracy (100%) in capturing the abc claimed medications for senior patients in alberta.",31348593

Seventeen percent (83/483) of the participants reported prior experience before their hospital stay; 45% received a sleep-inducing drug during hospitalization; 17% wished to continue taking them after discharge. Of the 400 patients who had no prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs, 147 (37%) became first-time users in the hospital, and 27% (40/147) of these wished to continue this medication after discharged. Strong predictors for this wish were the reduction of sleep onset problems (adjusted odds ratio, 6.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.38-16.44) and any prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs (4.08; 1.97-8.48). Many older patients become first-time users of sleep-inducing drugs in the hospital. Especially the experience of sleep onset improvements influences the wish to continue sleep-inducing drug use after discharge. Avoiding first-time use should become a goal of hospital policy and be taken into account when weighing the benefits and risks of sleep-inducing drugs.",31179613

The role of pharmacists in spontaneous adrs reporting is crucial in the pharmacovigilance system since it helps to monitor the patients' treatment in real-life conditions. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacists' attitudes to and knowledge on spontaneous adrs reporting in poland and to identify the reasons for underreporting of adrs. The study was conducted between january 2016 and january 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was designed and distributed to pharmacists.

Only 16% (n = 84) of the respondents have ever attended a training on pharmacovigilance. Eighty-one percent (n = 422) of pharmacists believe that not all synthetic drugs available on the market were safe. Twenty-eight percent (n = 146) of the respondents were certain about safety of drugs of natural origin, and 16% (n = 84) were of an opinion that adverse reactions following administration of such drugs should not be reported at all. To conclude, there is an increasing awareness of the need to develop pharmacovigilance practices.

Results from our survey also highlight a lack of awareness regarding the availability of biosimilars, their nomenclature, automatic substitution, and reporting adverse drug reactions because of these drugs. The main barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in latin america are the lack of consensus on the interchangeability of reference biologics and biosimilars, and the need for more suitably trained personnel to carry out effective postmarketing pharmacovigilance of biosimilars.

Empirical equipoise was previously proposed as a tool to assess patient similarity based on propensity scores (ps). We extended this work for multigroup observational studies. We modified the tool to allow for multinomial exposures such that the proposed definition reduces to the original when there are only two groups. We illustrated how the tool can be used as a method to assess study design within three-group clinical examples. We then conducted three-group simulations to assess how the tool performed in a setting with residual confounding after ps weighting. In a clinical example based on rheumatoid arthritis, 44.5% of the sample fell within the region of empirical equipoise when considering first-line biologics, whereas 57.7% did so for second-line biologics, consistent with the expectation that a second-line design results in better equipoise. In a simulation where the unmeasured confounder had the same magnitude of association with the treatment as the measured confounders and a 25% greater association with the outcome, the tool crossed the proposed threshold for empirical equipoise at a residual confounding of 20% on the ratio scale. When the unmeasured variable had a twice larger association with treatment, the tool became less sensitive and crossed the threshold at a residual confounding of 30%.

Data were from kaiser permanente northwest (kpnw), a large integrated health plan. We iteratively developed and evaluated an algorithm for electronically identifying inpatient overdose/oversedation in kpnw hospitals from 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2014. Chart audits assessed accuracy; data sources included administrative and clinical records. The best-performing algorithm used these rules: (1) include events with opioids administered in an inpatient setting (including emergency department/urgent care) followed by naloxone administration within 275 hours of continuous inpatient stay; (2) exclude events with electroconvulsive therapy procedure codes; and (3) exclude events in which an opioid was administered prior to hospital discharge and followed by readmission with subsequent naloxone administration. Using this algorithm, we identified 870 suspect inpatient overdose/oversedation events and chart audited a random sample of 235. Of the random sample, 185 (78.7%) were deemed overdoses/oversedation, 37 (15.5%) were not, and 13 (5.5%) were possible cases. The number of hours between time of opioid and naloxone administration did not affect algorithm accuracy. When ""possible"" overdoses/oversedations were included with confirmed events, overall positive predictive value (ppv) was very good (ppv = 84.0%). Additionally, ppv was reasonable when evaluated specifically for hospital stays with emergency/urgent care admissions (ppv = 77.0%) and excellent for elective surgery admissions (ppv = 97.0%).

Despite clear advantages, these databases share some important limitations that may threaten the validity of studies emerging from them. This paper describes the distinctive methodological aspects of conducting drug safety studies in healthcare utilization databases with special emphasis on design and analytic approaches to minimize biases. We describe considerations for study design, cohort definition, and follow-up. We then address issues related to exposure ascertainment based on prescription fills, including the importance of the etiologically relevant window and of properly accounting for preterm births. This is followed by a discussion of advantages and challenges when ascertaining maternal and infant outcomes based on secondary data. We then explore useful approaches to address confounding within the context of pregnancy research and of the potential for selection bias when restricting the cohort to live births. Finally, we consider issues related to external validity and statistical significance. The examples are mainly drawn from a pregnancy cohort nested in the medicaid analytic extract. The approaches presented provide guidance regarding the important methodological considerations that need to be attended to in order to generate valid, minimally biased risk when using large healthcare utilization databases for drug safety surveillance in pregnancy.",31074570

Cases were verified by a systematic chart review. Poisson regression was used to compare incidence in defined time windows following vaccination. Of 266 cases of narcolepsy identified, 25% (66/266) were prevalent cases with symptom onset documented before vaccine exposure.

Using the index date from the patient registry, the adjusted increase in risk was about seven times elevated for all three time intervals. The magnitude of the estimated increased risk for narcolepsy following exposure to the a(h1n1) pandemic vaccine is highly dependent on the method used to determine the index date for disease onset.

The first method only accounted for uncertainty introduced during the matching process (the observation resampling approach). The second method accounted for uncertainty introduced during both ps estimation and matching processes (the ps reestimation approach). Variance was estimated based on percentile and empirical standard errors, and treatment effect estimation was based on median and mean of the estimated treatment effects across 1000 bootstrap resamples.

Tuberculosis incidence is relatively high in asian people, and an increase in ppi prescriptions has been reported in south korea. Thus, we investigated the association between ppi use and tuberculosis development. We conducted a case-control study on 25 672 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients using the national health insurance service-national sample cohort (nhis-nsc) database (2002-2013). We selected a control group without tuberculosis using 1:1 exact matching based on age, sex, index year, insurance type, and income level. We investigated ppi exposure 2 years prior to the index date and classified the subjects into nonuser, continuous user, recent user, and former user groups. Odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for tuberculosis development were calculated using conditional logistic regression. A total of 51 344 cases and controls were analyzed. Recent ppi use (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 1.28; 95% ci, 1.18-1.39) and continuous ppi use (aor, 1.13; 95% ci 1.10-1.28) were significantly associated with tuberculosis development, compared with nonuse of ppis. An increased tuberculosis incidence was not observed in the former use group compared with the nonuse group (aor 1.05, 95% ci 0.95-1.17). In this case-control study, we found that recent ppi use and continuous ppi use were associated with increased tuberculosis development.

Case report data are drawn from a quarterly survey of prescription drug diversion completed by a national sample of law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Rates of diversion per 100 000 population were calculated for each year from 2002 to 2017 for prescription medications with greater than 400 reported cases during the period. Cyclobenzaprine, quetiapine, and trazodone met criteria for analysis. We found a significant and steady increase in the diversion of each drug over the period. The 2017 annual rates of diversion per 100 000 population for the three medications range from 0.0428 to 0.0726. Although these rates of diversion are much lower than the rate for total opioid analgesics, they are all more than five times higher in 2017 compared with 2002. While diversion rates for opioids have decreased in recent years, rates for cyclobenzaprine, quetiapine, and trazodone have continued to increase. A common attribute of the three nonscheduled drugs studied here is that all are used for the treatment and/or self-treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and the increasing diversion of these drugs may be related to the ongoing opioid epidemic and to increasing levels of control over pharmaceutical opioid availability in the united states.

Medicare beneficiaries age 66 or older with an office visit and at least 12 months of pre-visit continuous medicare a/b enrollment were identified in 2008. Five-year mortality was assessed through 2013. Secondary outcomes included 30-, 90-, and 180-day and 1-year mortality. Claims-based predictors, including comorbidities and indicators of disability, frailty, and functional impairment, were selected using regularized logistic regression, applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) in a random 80% training sample. Model performance was assessed and compared with the gagne comorbidity score in the 20% validation sample. Overall, 183 204 (24%) individuals died. In addition to demographics, 161 indicators of comorbidity and function were included in the final model. In the validation sample, the c-statistic was 0.825 (0.823-0.828). Median-predicted probability of 5-year mortality was 14%; almost 4% of the cohort had a predicted probability greater than 80%. Compared with the gagne score, the lasso model led to improved 5-year mortality classification (net reclassification index = 9.9%; integrated discrimination index = 5.2%). Our claims-based model predicting 5-year mortality showed excellent discrimination and calibration, similar to the gagne score model, but resulted in improved mortality classification.

In a cohort of pregnant women (n = 6876), perinatal nsaid use was assessed by prescriptions and self-report. Primary neurodevelopmental outcomes included attention problems using maternal reports at 1½, 3, and 5 years.

Maternal reports suggested that prenatal exposure to nsaids was associated with more attention problems at younger ages (eg, at age 3: mean difference in attention problems score: 0.30; 95% ci 0.12, 0.48). However, no strong association with attention problems was found in the teacher report, and a similarly strong association between prenatal nsaid exposure and somatic complaints suggests residual confounding by indication likely remains. Moreover, prenatal exposure to nsaids was not associated with an observed measure of iq (mean difference in iq score: -0.32; 95% ci: -1.82, 1.19).

We simulated cohorts of 10 000 patients with binary variables for a single confounder, exposure, and outcome. Baseline time was simulated based on the observed distribution in a claims-based comparison of statin users versus nonusers. We compared bias after measuring confounders using fixed-duration and all-available caps, both when exposure groups had similar and discrepant amounts of available baseline time. When the comparison groups had similar amounts of baseline time, an all-available cap was less biased than a fixed-duration cap. When baseline time differed between comparison groups, the preferable cap approach depended on the direction of confounding and which exposure group had higher covariate sensitivity. These findings were consistent in direction across sensitivity analyses. In certain settings of differential available baseline time between exposure groups, the all-available cap was more biased than the fixed-duration cap. The relative directions and strengths of confounding and misclassification biases are an important consideration when choosing between a fixed-duration or all-available cap, but they are often unknown. Therefore, we recommend comparing the amount of available baseline time between exposure groups.

We first used simulations to compare the performances of different ps-based methods, either alone or in combination with further mlr adjustment, in estimating att. Ps methods were, respectively, optimal pair (opm) and full (ofm) ps matching, subclassification on the ps (sbc), and the inverse probability of treatment weighting (iptw). We simulated several scenarios, according to different sample sizes, proportions of treated vs untreated subjects, and types of hrqol outcomes.

Overall, both methods showed also lower variability in estimates than sbc and ofm. Sbc performed worst, generally providing the highest levels of bias. Further mlr adjustment lessened bias for all methods, however providing higher type i error for sbc and ofm. In the real case, all methods provided similar att estimates except for one outcome.

The safety profile of these medications is not firmly established, and concerns have been raised about their potential carcinogenicity. The objective of our study was to produce new evidence on the effect of incretin-based medications on cancer risk in patients with dm2. We conducted a ""retrospective cohort"" study with data from the clinical practice research datalink and the hospital episodes statistics in the uk. New users of either an incretin-based medication (n = 18 885) or a sulfonylurea medication (n = 36 929) between 2007 and 2013 were identified and followed for up to 8 years. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the quasi-intention-to-treat and quasi-per-protocol hazard-ratios for the association between incretin-based medications with cancer while adjusting for potential confounders. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for use of incretin-based medications versus use of sulfonylurea medications for the overall-cancer outcome was 0.97 (0.90, 1.05) in the quasi-intention-to-treat analysis and 0.90 (0.81, 1.00) in the quasi-per-protocol analysis. In both analyses, the hazard-ratio functions over the 8-year follow-up seemed fairly constant, and the 8-year cumulative-risk functions in the two subcohorts were similar. Our study suggests that the use of incretin-based medications in patients with dm2 does not increase the risk of cancer relative to the use of sulfonylurea medications, at least in the first several years of the use.

This study aimed to develop a predictive algorithm that identifies patients using antidepressants for the treatment of depression. Pharmaceutical benefits scheme (pbs) and medicare benefits schedule (mbs) claims data were linked to follow-up questionnaires (completed in 2012-2013) for participants of the 45 and up study-a cohort study of residents of new south wales, australia, aged 45 years and older. The sample composed participants who were dispensed an antidepressant in the 30 days prior to questionnaire completion (n = 3162). An algorithm based on patient characteristics, pharmaceutical dispensings, and claims for mental health services was built using group-lasso interaction network (glinternet), with self-reported receipt of treatment for depression as the outcome. The predictive performance of the algorithm was assessed via bootstrap resampling. The algorithm composes 15 main effects and 11 interactions, with type of antidepressant dispensed and claims for mental health services the strongest predictors. The ability of the algorithm to discriminate between antidepressant users with and without depression was 0.73. At a predicted probability cut-off of 0.6, specificity was 93.8% and sensitivity was 23.6%. Using this algorithm with a high probability cut-off yields high specificity and facilitates the exclusion of individuals using antidepressants for indications other than depression, thereby mitigating the risk of confounding by indication when evaluating the outcomes of antidepressant use.",30680859

Ppi use has been associated with increased hcap risk, but this association likely results from confounding by indication due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). Using the uk's clinical practice research datalink, we compared the risk of hcap within 180 days between ppi users and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (h2ra) users in an acnu cohort using cox proportional hazard models with a time-fixed exposure definition adjusted for high-dimensional propensity score deciles. We then performed the same analysis on an ""extremely-restricted"" cohort of incident nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) users, some of whom received ppis for prophylaxis. Because ppis were given as prophylaxis in this population, confounding due to gerd should be limited.

Disproportionality analysis was performed for all drug-adverse event (ae) pairs in the entire database and for the subsets of males and females. Ac-aseptic meningitis was highlighted for an increased disproportionality in the male subgroup in the absence of an elevated disproportionality measure for the database overall. A clinical review was undertaken. Clinical review revealed a similar statistical pattern of gender difference observed for amoxicillin, evidence to suggest a delayed type 4 hypersensitivity reaction with th1 cells as a mechanism for amoxicillin-aseptic meningitis, the existence of sex differences in immune responses (th1/th2), and an analogous increased risk of drug-induced liver injury by ac in males.

All potential incident crc cases recorded during the study period 2001 to 2014 among patients 20 to 89 years old were identified using a defined case-finding algorithm tailored to bifap database characteristics and based on codes plus text mining strategies. Potential crc cases identified by the algorithm were classified into eight homogeneous groups according to recording characteristics. Random samples of 100 cases per group were obtained, and electronic medical records were manually reviewed by two independent researchers. Positive predictive values (ppvs) were estimated per each group and for the whole sample taking into account the stratified sampling. Standardized incidence rate (sir) of crc was estimated and compared with that reported by the national cancer registry. Negative predictive value (npv) was also estimated in a random sample of 100 non-crc patients by the algorithm. A total of 17 008 potential crc cases were identified. Most of them (14793; 87%) were recorded as incident diagnosis with linked clinical notes as free text, having this group a ppv of 92.1% (95%ci: 87.1%-95.3%). The overall ppv including all groups was 87.3% (95%ci: 83.3%-90.4%). Sir of crc was 55.5 per 100.000 person-years. Sir increased with age and was higher in men as compared with women (77.7 vs 38.1 per 100.000 py, respectively) which were in line with those reported by the network of cancer registries in spain. Npv was of 100% (96.3%-100%). This study shows a high validity of the crc cases identified by the algorithm and a high level of crc recording in bifap database and supports its appropriateness to validly identify incident crc cases in bifap.",30548462

In a subset of approximately 5000 case and control mothers from five us centers (2008-2012), a research nurse abstracted subjects' medical records. Ga at delivery was calculated as date of delivery minus (estimated date of confinement [edc] minus 280); if edc was unknown, last menstrual period served as a proxy for start of pregnancy.

We investigated the association between doac use (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) and subsequent ppi initiation as a proxy for gastrointestinal complaints. In this population-based observational study with an active-comparator new user study design, anonymised dispensing data from community pharmacies in the netherlands from 2012 to 2016 were used.

We identified pregnancies among women aged 15 to 54 years between 01/01/2004 and 09/30/2015 from 16 health plans participating in sentinel. We inferred indication using icd-9-cm codes in the 183-day period before conception. We assessed proportion of infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab by calendar year, indication, and maternal age, and compared them to proportions in an age-matched, indication-matched, and date-matched non-pregnant cohort. Among 19 681 pregnancies with at least one chronic inflammatory condition, 2990 (15.2%) received a tnfi. In both pregnancies and matched non-pregnant cohort, tnfi use was highest (34.4%; 55.8%) for psa patients and lowest (6.2%; 13.4%) for pso patients. Etanercept was most frequently used among as/jia/psa/pso/ra patients, while infliximab was the preferred tnfi for cd/uc patients. Except for infliximab and certolizumab, tnfi use during pregnancy decreased after the first trimester. Pregnancies among older pregnant women (45-54 years) were more likely to be treated compared with the matched non-pregnant cohort. There was a preference for etanercept among pregnancies with as/jia/psa/pso/ra, despite the availability of other tnfis. Decline in tnfi use after the first trimester may be related to the desire to reduce tnfis transplacental transfer and to minimize infection risk to the fetus or baby associated with live vaccine immunizations after birth.",30430682

We identified patients in the study whose admissions were coded as adrs using icd-10-am codes. We then compared the prevalence and characteristics of adr-related hospital admissions identified by the two approaches. According to icd-10-am coding, 2.7% of patients were admitted due to adrs, while 15.0% of patients were deemed to have been admitted due to adrs based on prospective identification by clinical pharmacists. Most (85.7%) patients coded as having an adr-related hospital admission were also identified as such prospectively.

Cox regression was performed to estimate the hazard ratios (hrs) of epilepsy after adjusting for parental and children factors. To evaluate confounding by indication, we extended the exposure time window from 2 years before pregnancy and stratified the analyses by maternal asthma, in particular analyses by trimesters. The exposed children had a 1.24-fold risk of epilepsy (hr = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.12, 1.38). Compared with no prenatal exposure from 2 years before pregnancy through delivery, the hr was 1.11 (95% ci: 1.01, 1.22) in children of mothers with β2aas use only before pregnancy, 1.28 (95% ci: 1.09, 1.50) only during pregnancy, and 1.23 (95% ci: 1.07, 1.41) both before and during pregnancy.

Using the marketscan database, the risk of major birth defects was ascertained in live-born infants whose birth mothers were exposed to sumatriptan, naratriptan, or sumatriptan/naproxen during pregnancy. The frequencies of outcomes observed were compared with the findings of the 16-year sumatriptan, naratripan, and sumatriptan/naproxen prospective pregnancy registry.

Information component (ic) was the method used for disproportionality analysis. By using ic thresholds of various strengths (0.05-4.00), the original quantitative data matrix was transformed into 80 different binary data matrices, where each cell contained either a 1 or 0.

In this study, we developed a side effect-monitoring tool and aimed to clarify the influence and efficiency of monitoring side effects by using the tool in patients taking atypical antipsychotics in whom it is necessary to check clinical test values such as blood sugar levels. We extracted clinical test values for patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics from electronic medical records.

Observational study of cilostazol in the health improvement network (united kingdom), epichron cohort (spain), sidiap (spain), swedish national databases, and gepard (germany). Among new users of cilostazol, we compared the prevalence of conditions targeted by the risk minimization measures in the periods before (2002-2012) and after (2014) implementation. Conditions evaluated were prevalence of smoking, cardiovascular conditions, concurrent use of ≥2 antiplatelet agents, concurrent use of potent cyp3a4/cyp2c19 inhibitors and high-dose cilostazol, early monitoring of all users, and continuous monitoring of users at high cardiovascular risk. We included 22 593 and 1821 new users of cilostazol before and after implementation of risk minimization measures, respectively. After implementation, the frequency of several conditions related to the labeling changes improved in all the study populations: prevalence of use decreased between 13% (epichron) and 57% (sidiap), frequency of cardiovascular contraindications decreased between 8% (gepard) and 84% (epichron), and concurrent use of high-dose cilostazol and potent cyp3a4/cyp2c19 inhibitors decreased between 6% (sweden) and 100% (epichron). The frequency of other conditions improved in most study populations, except smoking, which decreased only in epichron (48% reduction).

We conducted a simulation study to examine how avoiding sharing individual-level data in a distributed data network can affect analytic results. The base scenario had four sites of varying sizes with 5% outcome incidence, 50% treatment prevalence, and seven confounders. We varied treatment prevalence, outcome incidence, treatment effect, site size, number of sites, and covariate distribution. Confounding adjustment was conducted using propensity score or disease risk score. We compared analyses of three types of aggregate-level data requested from sites: risk-set, summary-table, or effect-estimate data (meta-analysis) with benchmark results of analysis of pooled individual-level data. We assessed bias and precision of hazard ratio estimates as well as the accuracy of standard error estimates. All the aggregate-level data-sharing approaches, regardless of confounding adjustment methods, successfully approximated pooled individual-level data analysis in most simulation scenarios. Meta-analysis showed minor bias when using inverse probability of treatment weights (iptw) in infrequent exposure (5%), rare outcome (0.01%), and small site (5,000 patients) settings. Se estimates became less accurate for iptw risk-set approach with less frequent exposure and for propensity score-matching meta-analysis approach with rare outcomes. Overall, we found that we can avoid sharing individual-level data and obtain valid results in many settings, although care must be taken with meta-analysis approach in infrequent exposure and rare outcome scenarios, particularly when confounding adjustment is performed with iptw.",30022561

The approaches undergoing empirical validation covered assumptions of a fixed daily intake of either 0.5 or 1.0 defined daily dose (ddd), as well as estimates based on the reverse parametric waiting time distribution (rwtd), with different sets of covariates. We converted estimates of prescription duration to daily dose and compared them to prescribed daily dose as recorded in a clinical registry (using bland-altman plots). Methods were compared based on their average prediction error (logarithmic scale) and their limit of agreement ratio (ratio of mean error ± 1.96 sd after transformation to original scale). Estimates of daily doses were underestimated by 19% or overestimated by 62% when assumptions of 0.5 or 1.0 ddd were applied. The limit of agreement ratio was 6.721 for both assumptions. The rwtd-based approaches performed better when using the estimated mean value of the inter-arrival density, yielding on average negligible bias (relative difference of 0 to 2%) and with limit of agreement ratios decreasing upon additional covariate adjustment (from 6.857 with no adjustment to 4.036 with the fully adjusted model).

In response, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) moved to limit opioid prescribing with the release of opioid prescribing guidelines for chronic noncancer pain in march 2016. The guidelines represent a logical and timely federal response to this growing crisis. However, cdc acknowledged that the evidence base linking opioid prescribing to opioid use disorders and overdose was grades 3 and 4. Motivated by the need to strengthen the evidence base, this review details limitations of the opioid safety studies cited in the cdc guidelines with a focus on methodological limitations related to internal and external validity. Internal validity concerns were related to poor confounding control, variable misclassification, selection bias, competing risks, and potential competing interventions. External validity concerns arose from the use of limited source populations, historical data (in a fast-changing epidemic), and issues with handling of cancer and acute pain patients' data.

The use of dpp-4 inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of uti (adjusted irr 1.23, 95% ci [1.04-1.45]). After propensity score matching, the association remained significant (adjusted irr 1.28, 95% ci [1.05-1.56]).

Unmatched individuals of each treatment-class had significantly more hospitalizations than controls, while matched treated people, apart from those in class 0% to 20%, had a decrease of hospitalizations, as large as the increase in prescribed drug. Statin effect in reducing hospitalizations translated into a number needed to treat (nnt) ranging across treatment strata from 102 to 54. Compliance to statin prescribed daily doses above the threshold 20% of ddd, along a 5-year follow-up, prevented hospitalizations due to infectious diseases in a large unselected population, after adjusting for covariates able to modulate baseline risk of infections.

A series of monthly pseudotrials were created, using propensity score methodology to balance baseline characteristics between saba-exposed (identified by prescription) and saba-unexposed children. Association between saba and subsequent arrhythmia for each health system was estimated through pooled logistic regression with separate estimates for children initiating under and over 4 years old (off-label and on-label, respectively). Eleven percent of the cohort received a saba prescription, 57% occurred under the age of 4 years (off-label). During the follow-up period, there were 283 first arrhythmia events, most commonly atrial tachyarrhythmias and premature ventricular/atrial contractions. In 1 health system, adjusted risk for arrhythmia was increased among exposed children (or 1.89, 95% ci 1.31-2.73) without evidence of interaction between label status and risk. The absolute adjusted rate difference was 3.6/10 000 person-years of saba exposure. The association between saba exposure and arrhythmias was less strong in the second system (or 1.26, 95% ci 0.30-5.33). Using ehr data, we could estimate the risk of a rare event associated with medication use and determine difference in risk related to on-label versus off-label status.

We identified outpatient visits (2007-2012) with recently documented (≤180 days) cardiovascular risk and classified patients according to whether the exposure (statin) was initiated within 14 days. We selected each beneficiary's first eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during the respective look-backs: continuous enrollment (1 or 3 years for fixed look-back; 180 days for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. We estimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (hrs) for the effect of statin initiation on incident 6-month cancer (a known null effect) and 2-year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using each look-back. Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated hr from the all-available approach (hr = 0.90, 95% ci: 0.83, 0.98) was less biased than the 1-year look-back (hr = 0.79, 95% ci: 0.73, 0.84), which included beneficiaries with prevalent cancer. The 3-year look-back (hr = 1.05, 95% ci: 0.90, 1.21) was somewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due the exclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuous enrollment (62.0% and 59.9% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). All approaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality. Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding. The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the 3-year fixed, which produced the least biased point estimate. If 3-year look-backs are infeasible (eg, due to power/sample), all-available look-backs may be preferable to short (1-year) fixed look-backs.",29655187

Thus, there is an unmet need to improve understanding the appropriate course of action to address unmeasured confounding under a variety of research scenarios. We implemented a stepwise search strategy to find articles discussing the assessment of unmeasured confounding in electronic literature databases. Identified publications were reviewed and characterized by the applicable research settings and information requirements required for implementing each method. We further used this information to develop a best practice recommendation to help guide the selection of appropriate analytical methods for assessing the potential impact of unmeasured confounding. Over 100 papers were reviewed, and 15 methods were identified. We used a flowchart to illustrate the best practice recommendation which was driven by 2 critical components: (1) availability of information on the unmeasured confounders; and (2) goals of the unmeasured confounding assessment. Key factors for implementation of each method were summarized in a checklist to provide further assistance to researchers for implementing these methods.

Although 74% of registries ascertained baseline health conditions and monitored concomitant medication use, fewer (45%) considered drug exposure duration or dosage. Thirty-seven percent of non pending registries had enrollment below sample size expectation. Seventeen registries published findings in journals/conference proceedings, 13 from open registries. Three closed registries generated results that contributed to product label changes. High-performance registries scored higher in design metrics related to sample size considerations (76% versus 62%) and adequate analysis plan (53% versus 35%), and interim report submission (76% versus 65%). There was a significant difference in proportion of registries with clear primary objectives between high versus not high performing registries (100% versus 78%). This study suggests clear objectives, patient accrual/retention efforts, adequate analysis plans, and interim reports contribute to the performance of drug exposure registries.",29349833

Because α1-adrenoceptors are also present in the brain, the potential exists for adverse effects on cognitive functions. We explored the association between tamsulosin use and dementia risk. We used medicare data (2006-2012) to conduct a cohort study among patients aged ≥65 years and diagnosed with bph. Men taking tamsulosin (n = 253 136) were matched at a 1:1 ratio using propensity-scores to each of 6 comparison cohorts: patients who used no bph-medication (n = 180 926), and patients who used the following alternative-bph-medications: doxazosin (n = 28 581), terazosin (n = 23 858), alfuzosin (n = 17 934), dutasteride (n = 34 027), and finasteride (n = 38 767). Assessment began following the first fill of bph-medication to identify incident dementia by icd-9 diagnosis codes. We estimated hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) for dementia using cox proportional hazard regression for each of the 6 propensity-score-matched cohort-pairs. The median follow-up period for all cohorts was 19.8 months. After propensity-score matching, the tamsulosin cohort had an incidence of dementia of 31.3/1000 person-years compared with only 25.9/1000 person-years in the no-bph-medication cohort. The risk of dementia was significantly higher in the tamsulosin cohort, when compared with the no-bph-medication cohort (hr [95% ci]: 1.17 [1.14, 1.21]) and each of the alternative-bph-medication cohorts: doxazosin (1.20 [1.12, 1.28]), terazosin (1.11 [1.04, 1.19]), alfuzosin (1.12 [1.03, 1.22]), dutasteride (1.26 [1.19, 1.34]), and finasteride (1.13 [1.07, 1.19]).

We applied the klompas algorithm and the diagnosis code criterion to a cohort of 66 690 adult kaiser permanente colorado members with diabetes.

The klompas algorithm identified 3286 (4.9% of 66 690) adults with diabetes as having type 1 diabetes. Based on chart reviews, the overall positive predictive value was 94.5%. The requirement that the majority of diabetes diagnosis codes be type 1 identified 3000 (4.5%) as having type 1 diabetes and had a positive predictive value of 96.4%. However, the algorithm criterion involving dispensing of urine acetone test strips performed poorly, with a positive predictive value of 20.0%.

Simulations were conducted based on proposed or ongoing vaccine safety datalink studies. We simulated 4 studies of 2 exposure groups (children with no vaccines or on alternative schedules) and 2 baseline outcome levels (100 and 1000/100 000 person-years), with 3 relative risk (rr) levels (rr = 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00), across 1000 replications using probabilistic modeling. We quantified bias from non-differential and differential outcome misclassification, based on levels previously measured in database research (sensitivity > 95%; specificity > 99%). We calculated median outcome ppvs, median observed rrs, type 1 error, and bias-corrected rrs following qba. We observed ppvs from 34% to 98%. With non-differential misclassification and true rr = 2.00, median bias was toward the null, with severe bias (median observed rr = 1.33) with ppv = 34% and modest bias (median observed rr = 1.83) with ppv = 83%. With differential misclassification, ppvs did not reflect median bias, and there was type 1 error of 100% with ppv = 90%. Qba was generally effective in correcting misclassification bias. In immunization schedule studies, outcome misclassification may be non-differential or differential to exposure. Overall outcome ppvs do not reflect the distribution of false positives by exposure and are poor indicators of bias in individual studies.

The aim of this study is to provide an overview and guidance on some of the available methodologies used to address problems related to time-varying exposure and confounding in pharmacoepidemiology and other observational studies. The methods are explored from a conceptual rather than an analytical perspective. The methods described in this study have been identified exploring the literature concerning to the time-varying exposure concept and basing the search on four fundamental pharmacoepidemiological problems, construction of treatment episodes, time-varying confounders, cumulative exposure and latency, and treatment switching. A correct treatment episodes construction is fundamental to avoid bias in treatment effect estimates. Several methods exist to address time-varying covariates, but the complexity of the most advanced approaches-eg, marginal structural models or structural nested failure time models-and the lack of user-friendly statistical packages have prevented broader adoption of these methods. Consequently, simpler methods are most commonly used, including, for example, methods without any adjustment strategy and models with time-varying covariates. The magnitude of exposure needs to be considered and properly modelled. Further research on the application and implementation of the most complex methods is needed. Because different methods can lead to substantial differences in the treatment effect estimates, the application of several methods and comparison of the results is recommended. Treatment episodes estimation and exposure quantification are key parts in the estimation of treatment effects or associations of interest.",29285840

Using the hospital treatment insights (hti) database, which links hospital episode statistics to pharmacy records from 43 out of 153 hospital trusts in england, we estimated the proportion of missed linkage and identified characteristics associated with missing data. Linkage of antibiotics to patients was inconsistent and dependent on drug type and clinical setting, so that linkage for some specific antibiotics was high (80-100%), but overall, only 27.6% (ci: 27.4%-27.8%) for all antibiotics dispensed. Linkage was best for quinolones (62.6%; ci: 61.8%-63.8%), but only 21.1% (ci: 21.1%-21.2%) for penicillins. Linkage was lower for common antibiotics and in emergency departments; however, 80% linkage was achieved for individual drugs like clindamycin, especially on wards with reduced ward stock use. For those antibiotics with high linkage, hti might be used to study associations between indication, dispensing, and outcomes. However, the majority of common antibiotics had insufficient linkage, likely due to extensive use of ward stocks.

We evaluate whether the status of being overweight or obese is associated with increase in the development of hepatotoxicity and acute liver injury (ali) in patients with acute acetaminophen overdose. This was a retrospective cohort study comparing the risk of hepatotoxicity and ali between overweight or obese patients (body mass index [bmi] ≥ 25) and normal bmi patients (bmi ≤ 24.9) presenting with acute acetaminophen overdose at siriraj hospital during january 2004 to june 2012. All patients were treated with intravenous n-acetylcysteine. Psi parameters were calculated. High psi was defined as psi of ≥5.0 mm-hour. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regressions, odds ratio (or), stratified or, and 95% confidence interval (ci). There were 197 patients who fulfilled the criteria for analysis, 35 (17.8%) were obese, 24 (12.2%) were overweight, and 138 (70%) were normal bmi cases. Hepatotoxicity and ali developed in 25 (12.7%) and 40 (20.3%) cases, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that the overweight-obesity status and log  (psi value) were significant risk factors of ali, with or (95% ci) of 2.68 (1.21-5.95) and 1.74 (1.27-2.38), respectively, while only log  (psi) was a significant risk factor of hepatotoxicity with or (95% ci) 378.51 (39.49-3627.99). From stratification, overweight-obesity had significant odds ratios for ali in strata with low acetaminophen concentration, early initiation of n-acetylcysteine and low psi.

An algorithm based on a negative binomial time-series regression model run on 6 sequential observations prior to the monitored period was developed to forecast monthly counts of reports. A heuristic model to capture increases in counts when the previous 4 observations were null supplemented the regression. Count data were determined at drug-event combination. Sensitivity analyses were run to determine the effect of different methods of pooling or stratifying count data. Positive retrospective detections and positive predictive values (ppvs) were determined. The algorithm detected 8 of the 13 historical concerns, including all concerns of quality defects. The highest ppv (1.29%) resulted from increasing the lower count threshold from 3 to 5 and including literature reports in the counts. Both the regression model and the heuristic model components to the algorithm contributed to the detection of concerns. Sensitivity analysis indicates that stratification by commercial product reduces the ppv but suggests that pooling counts of related events may improve it. The results are encouraging and suggest that the algorithm could be useful for the detection of concerns that manifest as changes in frequency of reporting; however, further testing, including in prospective use, is warranted.",29143393

A secondary aim was to examine the impact of the 2012 policy change to record all pbs/rpbs dispensed medicines, irrespective of government subsidy, on the degree of under-estimation. Aggregated data on australian opioid utilisation were obtained for the 2010 to 2014 calendar years, including all single ingredient and combination opioid analgesic preparations available on prescription or over-the-counter (otc). Total opioid utilisation (oral morphine equivalent kilogrammes) was quantified using sales data from ims health and compared with pharmaceutical claims data from the pbs/rpbs. Pbs/rpbs claims data did not account for 12.4% of prescription-only opioid utilisation in 2014 and 19.1% in 2010, and 18.4% to 25.4% of total opioid use when accounting for otc preparations.

However, in daily practice, to treat patients adequately, there is a medical need for drugs that do not hold ma. To meet this medical need, medicinal products are used in clinical care without ma (unlicensed), such as products prepared by (local) pharmacies: the pharmaceutical preparations. Three types of pharmaceutical preparations are distinguished: (i) reconstitution in excess of summary of product characteristics; (ii) adaptation of a licensed medicinal product (outside its official labeling); (iii) medicinal products from an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Although unlicensed, patients may expect the same quality for these unlicensed pharmaceutical preparations as for the licensed medicinal products. To assure this quality, a proper risk-benefit assessment and proper documentation in (centralized) patient registries and linking to a national pharmacovigilance database should be in place. Based on a risk assessment matrix, requirements for quality assurance can be determined, which has impact on the level of documentation of a pharmaceutical preparation. In this paper, the approach for good documentation including quality assurance and benefit-risk assessment will be discussed and possibilities for patient registries are described to make these crucial preparations available for regular patient care. Key points ensuring pharmaceutical quality and performing a proper benefit-risk assessment will guarantee safe use of pharmaceutical preparations. Good documentation of (ultra-)orphan treatments can be collected in centralized patient registries and should be combined with existing information in (inter)national databases and self-reflection of patients. Linking patient registries to a centralized database for adverse drug events is highly recommended as it increases safety control of the (ultra) orphan pharmaceutical preparations.",29047193

We show that in a model that includes terms for both ever-exposure versus never-exposure and cumulative exposure, the parameter for ever-exposure represents the effect of time-invariant allocation bias, and the parameter for cumulative exposure represents the effect of the drug after adjustment for this unmeasured confounding. This assumes no stepwise effect of the drug on the event rate, no reverse causation, and no unmeasured time-varying confounders. We demonstrated this by modelling the effect of statins on cardiovascular disease, for which the true effect has been well characterised in randomised trials, using time-updated cox regression models in a national cohort of type 2 diabetes patients. The crude hazard ratio associated with ever-use of statins was 1.13 in a standard cohort analysis comparing exposed with unexposed person-time intervals. When ever-never use and cumulative exposure are modelled jointly, the effect of statins can be estimated from the cumulative exposure parameter (hazard ratio 0.97 per year of exposure, 95% ci 0.97 to 0.98). The ever-exposed term (hazard ratio 1.20, 1.16 to 1.23) in this model can be interpreted as estimating the allocation bias. Where stepwise effects on the risk of adverse events are unlikely, as for instance for effects on risk of cancer, joint modelling of ever-never and cumulative exposure can be used to study the effects of multiple drugs and to distinguish causal effects from confounding by allocation.",29024286

This study aimed to estimate (1) the prevalence of chronic pain and analgesia use in the australian population by age and sex; (2) the severity of pain in the population with chronic pain by sex; and (3) the distribution of recent pain severity in those using analgesia by age and sex. This study used cross-sectional, nationally representative data collected by the australian bureau of statistics 2011 to 2012 national health survey. A total of n = 20 426 participants were included with an overall response rate of 84.8%. Weighting procedures were applied to obtain population estimates, confidence intervals, and when testing for statistical significance. The prevalence of chronic and reoccurring pain (over a 6-month period) was 15.4% (2.75 million) for australians aged ≥15 years. Prevalence increased with age for both sexes. Significantly more females reported moderate-to-very severe pain overall (p < 0.001), and within most age groups. Recent use of opioid analgesia was reported by 12.0% of males and 13.4% of females with chronic pain. Chronic pain and opioid analgesic use are important public health issues in australia. Study estimates of chronic pain and recent pain were no greater than earlier estimates. The acknowledged increase of opioid use in the literature thus appears consistent with changing treatment and/or prescribing patterns over time. Sex differences regarding pain prevalence, severity, and opioid use were apparent.",28895247

Long-term use of prescription opioids was defined by use for 90 days or longer. The prevalence of prescription opioid use increased from 4.1% of us adults in 1999-2000 to 6.8% in 2013-2014 (odds ratio [or] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.10-1.75, p = .007). This trend was driven by a sharp increase in long-term use which increased from 1.8% to 5.4% (or = 2.22, 95% ci = 1.65-3.00, p < .001). Of all opioid users in 2013-2014, 79.4% were long-term users compared with 45.1% in 1999-2000. Long-term use was associated with poorer physical health, concurrent benzodiazepine use, and history of heroin use. The findings highlight the need for research on potential benefits and harms of long-term use of opioids and efforts to restrict long-term use to patients for whom the benefits outweigh the risks.",28879660

This is the first study examining the prevalence and the risks of off-label antidepressant prescriptions in minors over time in germany and analyzing patterns regarding age, sex, drug class, and type of off-label use. We used claims data of about two million individuals (<18 y) to calculate the share of off-label antidepressant prescriptions for the years 2004 to 2011, stratified by age, sex, and drug class. Off-label prescriptions were analyzed regarding underlying diagnoses, the prescribing doctor's specialty, and the type of off-label use. Incidence rates of adverse events were calculated for off- and on-label use, and the risk of suicidal events associated with off- or on-label use was examined in a nested case-control study. The prevalence of off-label prescriptions decreased from 58.0% to 40.9%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were more frequently prescribed off-label than tricyclic antidepressants (37.7% vs 17.5% in 2011). The most common type of off-label use was off-label use by age, followed by off-label use by indication, and off-label use by contraindication. Adverse events were rare with no significant differences between on- and off-label use. Although off-label antidepressant use in minors decreased over time, it is still common. However, this rather indicates a lack of approved drugs for the treatment of depression in this population than inappropriate medical treatment. This is supported by the fact that off-label use was not associated with a higher risk of adverse events than on-label use.",28840629

A large, us medical claims database was utilized to identify a cohort of 3882 scd patients, and characteristics of opioid use were analyzed. Clinical variables including age, gender, medication use, health care utilization, and medical history were evaluated for correlations with opioid use. Forty percent of patients took opioid medications during a 12-month span, and the prevalence of any opioid use was highest for 20 to 29-year-old patients (58%). The median daily opioid dose was 1.85 mg (interquartile range: 0.62-10.68 mg) oral morphine equivalents (ome). While most opioid users took between 0 and 5 mg ome daily, 3% of pediatric patients and 23% of adult patients used more than 30-mg ome daily.

Performance of each method was assessed using mean prediction error. The influence on predictive accuracy of (1) more homogeneous populations and (2) number and range of known hba1c values was explored. When estimating the last observation, the predictive accuracy of fpca was highest with over half of predicted values within 0.4 units, equivalent to laboratory measurement error. Predictive accuracy improved when estimating the middle observation with almost 60% predicted values within 0.4 units for fpca. These results were marginally better than that achieved by simpler approaches, such as last-occurrence-carried-forward linear interpolation. This pattern persisted with more homogeneous populations as well as when variability in hba1c measures coupled with frequency of data points were considered.

Second, we made the same comparison using empirical data from the aritmo project, a multiple database study investigating the risk of ventricular arrhythmia following the use of medications with arrhythmogenic potential. In our study, we specifically investigated the effect of current use of promethazine. Bias increased for one-stage meta-analysis with increasing (1) between-database variance of exposure effect and (2) heterogeneous confounding generated by two covariates.

In the regional population ≥18 years of age, 1626 noacs prescriptions per 100 000 population-years were filled in 2014 and 3370 in 2015. Prescription rate increased with age and was greater in males than in females. Overall, being a current noacs user was not associated with the risk of hospitalization for bleeding compared to being a nonuser. A nonsignificant increase in risk was observed among patients with low prescription intensity. This study showed an increasing time trend in noacs prescriptions noacs in friuli venezia giulia. In this italian population, noacs users had no significantly increased risk of bleeding events as compared with nonusers.",28758284

Claims-based data delineated pregnancy exposures and outcomes of live or nonlive births among women with cia and pso (etn exposed, unexposed) and general population (gp) comparators. Infant outcomes were determined for live-born infants covered by the mother's insurer. Medical records were obtained from all accessible mother-infant pairs with claims for mcms and a random sample of mothers. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the odds ratios (ors) of having at least one algorithm-defined mcm in the etn-exposed cohorts versus unexposed comparators. Prevalence estimates for pregnancy outcomes were comparable across cia and pso cohorts. Algorithm-defined prevalence estimates of having at least one mcm were 6.1% (etn exposed), 5.5% (unexposed), and 5.7% (gp cohort) for the cia cohort; pso cohort estimates were 2.0%, 4.2%, and 4.7%, respectively. The etn-exposure ors for having at least one algorithm-defined mcm among infants of cia mothers was 1.03 (95%ci: 0.51-2.10) and 0.39 (95%ci: 0.05-2.98) among infants of pso mothers. Logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting that included disease state resulted in an or of 0.65 (0.24, 1.72).

We examined how age affects the prevalence of previously undiagnosed vrfs and the extent of medication nonadherence among stroke patients. Using taiwan's national health insurance research database, we identified consecutive adult patients with first-ever stroke between 2000 and 2013. Diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia was ascertained using validated methods. We investigated (1) the proportion of patients who had undiagnosed vrfs within 3 years before stroke and (2) the proportion of nonadherence to medications among patients who had a previously diagnosed vrf.

The study focuses on the use of simvastatin and atorvastatin before and after their patent expiry and rosuvastatin, to investigate the impact of the reduced acquisition costs on prescribing. Interrupted time series analysis of primary care use data from the health and social care information centre database from 1998 to 2015. Primary care expenditure on statins increased by 125% during the period 1998 to 2004 driven by branded simvastatin and atorvastatin. Before 2003, the rate of use of more potent branded atorvastatin exceeds branded simvastatin. Between 2004 and 2011, the less potent but less expensive agent generic simvastatin has the higher utilisation rate (66%). Since 2012, the more potent agent but less expensive generic atorvastatin has the higher utilisation rate (50%). The more potent branded rosuvastatin failed to make a significant impact on the english statins market. The availability of generic statins has reduced overall expenditure significantly. When there is a significant price difference, acquisition cost appears to be the main influencing factor in prescribing statins, but, when costs are similar, potency is a key factor.

We evaluated a two-step multiple imputation approach based on complementary internal validation data obtained from two subsamples of study participants to reduce bias in hazard ratio (hr) estimates in cox regressions. We illustrated this approach using data from a surveyed sample of 6247 individuals in a study of statin-diabetes association in quebec. We corrected diabetes status and onset assessed from health administrative data against self-reported diabetes and/or elevated fasting blood glucose (fbg) assessed in subsamples. The association between statin use and new onset diabetes was evaluated using administrative data and the corrected data. By simulation, we assessed the performance of this method varying the true hr, sensitivity, specificity, and the size of validation subsamples. The adjusted hr of new onset diabetes among statin users versus non-users was 1.61 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.38) using administrative data only, 1.49 (0.95-2.34) when diabetes status and onset were corrected based on self-report and undiagnosed diabetes (fbg ≥ 7 mmol/l), and 1.36 (0.92-2.01) when corrected for self-report and undiagnosed diabetes/impaired fbg (≥ 6 mmol/l). In simulations, the multiple imputation approach yielded less biased hr estimates and appropriate coverage for both non-differential and differential misclassification. Large variations in the corrected hr estimates were observed using validation subsamples with low participation proportion. The bias correction was sometimes outweighed by the uncertainty introduced by the unknown time of event occurrence. Multiple imputation is useful to correct for outcome misclassification in time-to-event analyses if complementary validation data are available from subsamples.

This study examined the association between amount of industry payments to prescribers and generic drug prescribing rates among medicare part d prescribers. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 770 095 medicare part d prescribers after linking the 2013 national open payments data with 2013 medicare provider utilization and payment data. The exposure variable was the categorized amount of total industry payments to prescribers (i.e., meals, travel, research, and ownership). The outcome was prescriber's annual generic drug prescribing rate. Multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to examine the association between the amount of industry payments and prescriber's annual generic drug prescribing rates, controlling for prescriber's demographic and practice characteristics. In this sample, over one-third (38.0%) of medicare part d prescribers received industry payments in 2013. The mean annual generic drug prescribing rate was highest among prescribers receiving no payments and lowest among those receiving more than $500 of industry payments (77.5% vs. 71.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The receipt of industry payments was independently associated with prescribers' generic drug prescribing rate; higher payments corresponded with lower generic drug prescribing rates. Other prescriber characteristics associated with higher annual generic drug prescribing rate included male sex, non-northeast region, specialty, and patient volume. Receipt of industry payments was associated with a decreased rate of generic drug prescribing. How this affects patient care and total medical costs warrants further study.

The reverse wtd is the distribution of time from the last dispensed prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of it. It is a mirrored version of the ordinary wtd, which considers the first dispensed prescription of patients within a time window. Based on renewal process theory, the reverse wtd can be analyzed as an ordinary wtd with maximum likelihood estimation. Based on danish prescription data for nsaids, warfarin, bendroflumethiazide and levothyroxine in the years 2013 and 2014, we compared estimates from the reverse wtd to those of the ordinary wtd regarding prevalence, stopping fractions and the 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distributions. The fraction of all users in 2013 stopping treatment varied from 73.1% (nsaid) to 9.3% (levothyroxine). Comparing prevalence estimates of the reverse wtd at the end of 2013 with those of the ordinary wtd at the start of 2014, relative differences did not exceed 4.8%. For the estimated 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distribution, differences did not exceed 3.3%. The reverse wtd allows estimation of the aggregated fraction of users stopping treatment and prevalence, especially when the wtd reliably separates current users from users who have stopped treatment.

We developed an estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation for the reverse waiting time distribution (wtd), which is the distribution of time from the last prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of the time window. The reverse wtd consists of two distinctly different components: one component for prevalent users and one for patients stopping treatment. We extended the model to allow parameters of the reverse wtd to depend on linear combinations of covariates to obtain estimates and confidence intervals for percentiles of the inter-arrival density (time from one prescription to the subsequent). We applied the method to redemptions of warfarin, using the amount of drug filled, patient sex and patient age as covariates. The estimated prescription durations increased with redeemed amount and age. Women generally had longer prescription durations, which increased more with age than men. For 70-year-old women redeeming 300+ pills, we predicted a 95th percentile of the inter-arrival density of 225 (95%ci: 201, 249) days. For 50-year-old men redeeming 100 pills, the corresponding prediction was 97 (88, 106) days. The algorithm allows estimation of prescription durations based on the reverse wtd, which can depend upon observed covariates.

This study is based on a multinational, web-based study conducted in 15 european countries from october 2011 to february 2012. Information about maternal demographics, illnesses, and medication use during pregnancy was collected via an electronic questionnaire. Pregnant women and new mothers with a child less than 1-year-old could participate. The swedish, australian, and u.s. Risk classification systems were used to evaluate medication safety. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation models were used. A total of 587 medications were reported by the study sample (n = 6657). Sixty-nine percent of the women used medications classified as safe, 28% used medications classified as risky, and 3% used medications with no classification available. Both socio-demographic and medical factors were associated with the use of risky medications during pregnancy. Having a chronic disorder was the factor with the strongest association with the use of risky medications during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio = 3.99, 95% confidence interval 3.54-4.49). The majority of women used medications classified as safe to use during pregnancy. However, a considerable proportion of women still used medications classified as risky. Having a chronic disorder was an important driver for using risky medications. Such use may still be appropriate when considering the woman's underlying condition. Pre-pregnancy counselling is important to ensure safe medication use for both mother and child. © 2017 the authors. Pharmacoepidemiology & drug safety published by john wiley & sons ltd.",28449197

We compared those with ckd to a general population cohort without ckd (matched on age, sex, general practice, and calendar time [index date]). We identified any antidepressant prescribing in the six months prior to index date (prevalence), the first prescription after index date among non-prevalent users (incidence), and recorded diagnoses (indication). We compared antidepressant choice between patients with and without ckd among patients with a diagnosis of depression. There were 242 349 matched patients (median age 76 [interquartile range 70-82], male 39.3%) with and without ckd. Prevalence of antidepressant prescribing was 16.3 and 11.9%, and incidence was 57.2 and 42.4/1000 person-years, in patients with and without ckd, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, ckd remained associated with higher prevalence and incidence of antidepressant prescription. Regardless of ckd status, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were predominantly prescribed for depression or anxiety, while tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed for neuropathic pain or other reasons. Antidepressant choice was similar in depressed patients with and without ckd.

Following a review of the relevant literature, we developed a conceptual framework consisting of four domains (data, knowledge, behaviour and outcomes) intended for the evaluation of risk minimization measures put into practice in the danish health-care system. For the implementation of the framework, four classes of monitoring variables can be named and defined: patient descriptors, performance-related indicators of knowledge, behaviour and outcomes. We reviewed the features of the framework when applied to historical, real-world data following the introduction of dabigatran in denmark for the prophylactic treatment of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

Because of the opioid antagonism of naltrexone, ldn users are probably often warned against concomitant use with opioids. In this study, based on data from the norwegian prescription database, we examine changes in opioid consumption after starting ldn therapy. We included all norwegian patients (n = 3775) with at least one recorded ldn prescription in 2013 and at least one dispensed opioid prescription during the 365 days preceding the first ldn prescription. We allocated the patients into three subgroups depending on the number of collected ldn prescriptions and recorded the number of defined daily doses (ddds) on collected prescriptions on opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics and antipyretics from the same patients. Among the patients collecting ≥4 ldn prescriptions, annual average opioid consumption was reduced by 41 ddds per person (46%) compared with that of the previous year. The reduction was 12 ddds per person (15%) among users collecting two to three prescriptions and no change among those collecting only one ldn prescription. We observed no increase in the number of ddds in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other analgesics and antipyretics corresponding to the decrease in opioid use. Possibly, ldn users avoided opioids because of warnings on concomitant use or the patients continuing on ldn were less opioid dependent than those terminating ldn. Therapeutic effects of ldn contributing to lower opioid consumption cannot be ruled out. © 2017 the authors. Pharmacoepidemiology & drug safety published by john wiley & sons ltd.",28370746

Dispensing data were collected from the university of groningen pharmacy database (iadb.nl, 1999-2014) for elderly patients (≥60 years) starting beta-blockers and/or antidepressants. Based on the two main ddi alert systems (g-standard and pharmabase), incidences were divided between signalled (metoprolol-fluoxetine/paroxetine) and not-signalled (metoprolol-alternative antidepressants and alternative beta-blockers-paroxetine/fluoxetine) combinations. Incident users were defined as patients starting at least one signalled or a non-signalled combination. G-standard signalled throughout the study period, whereas pharmabase stopped after 2005. A total of 1763 patients had 2039 metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine co-prescriptions, despite ddi alert systems, and about 57.3% were signalled. The number of metoprolol-alternative antidepressant combinations (incidences = 3150) was higher than alternative beta-blocker-paroxetine/fluoxetine combinations (incidences = 1872). Metoprolol users are more likely to be co-medicated with an alternative antidepressant (incidences = 2320) than paroxetine/fluoxetine users (incidences = 1232) are. The number of paroxetine/fluoxetine users co-prescribed with alternative beta-blockers was comparable to those co-medicated with metoprolol (about 50%). Less than 5% of patients received a substitute therapy after using metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine. Most of the metoprolol users (90%) received a low dose (mean ddd = 0.47) regardless whether they were prescribed paroxetine/fluoxetine.

Among 256 418 patients initiating oac, 37 388 were excluded; 61 329 af and 59 859 dvt/pe patients were directly identified, leaving 88 488 unclassified patients. The final model (c-index: 0.93) included demographics, cardiologist prescriber, hospitalization for stroke, use of antiarrhythmics/beta-blockers/antihypertensive drugs and undergoing a holter/echocardiography procedure, thyroid function tests, but no d-dimer tests. With a specificity of 95% (sensitivity: 65%), 41% of the unclassified patients were assumed to be af outpatients. Similar results were obtained on 250 159 new users in 2014. This algorithm combining inpatient and outpatient claims data performed relatively well to identify af outpatients initiating oac. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28295882

Pubmed, cochrane, embase, cinahl, econlit, abi/inform, business source complete were searched. Studies published 2004-2016 assessing the economic impact of medication error were included. Cost values were expressed in euro 2015. A narrative synthesis was performed. A total of 4572 articles were identified from database searching, and 16 were included in the review. One study met all applicable quality criteria. Fifteen studies expressed economic impact in monetary terms. Mean cost per error per study ranged from €2.58 to €111 727.08. Healthcare costs were used to measure economic impact in 15 of the included studies with one study measuring litigation costs. Four studies included costs incurred in primary care with the remaining 12 measuring hospital costs. Five studies looked at general medication error in a general population with 11 studies reporting the economic impact of an individual type of medication error or error within a specific patient population. Considerable variability existed between studies in terms of financial cost, patients, settings and errors included. Many were of poor quality. Assessment of economic impact was conducted predominantly in the hospital setting with little assessment of primary care impact. Limited parameters were used to establish economic impact.

A total of 24 788 age and sex-matched population-based controls were randomly selected using density sampling. Ace inhibitor use between 1 january 2003 and the index date were determined by the date of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis among the cases. The incidence rate ratios of acute pancreatitis not diagnosed as biliary or alcohol-induced were modeled by conditional logistic regression and adjusted for comorbidities. A total of 1276 (26%) cases and 3946 (16%) controls had been exposed to ace inhibitors. The use of ace inhibitors was associated with an increased incidence rate of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio [or] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.59-1.95).

In this tutorial, we review the steps used in iv analyses and the underlying assumptions. We also present methods to assess the validity of those assumptions and describe sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of possible violations of those assumptions. Observational studies based on regression or propensity score analyses rely on the untestable assumption that there are no unmeasured confounders. Iv analysis is a tool that removes the bias caused by unmeasured confounding provided that key assumptions (some of which are also untestable) are met. When instruments are valid, iv methods provided unbiased treatment effect estimation in the presence of unmeasured confounders. However, the standard error of the iv estimate is higher than the standard error of non-iv estimates, e.g., regression and propensity score methods. Sensitivity analyses provided insight about the robustness of the iv results to the plausible degrees of violation of assumptions. Iv analysis should be used cautiously because the validity of iv estimates relies on assumptions that are, in general, untestable and difficult to be certain about. Thus, assessing the sensitivity of the estimate to violations of these assumptions is important and can better inform the causal inferences that can be drawn from the study.

This study was conducted to determine the rate, specific causes, and outcomes of ade-related hospitalization in the usa. We used the healthcare cost and utilization project's nationwide inpatient sample dataset for the years 2008 to 2011. We selected patients with ade based on 537 classification of diseases-9 codes. Main outcome measures included yearly prevalence, cost, length of stay, and mortality of ade-related hospitalizations. Calculations were performed on weighted samples, and statistical significance was set at p-value <0.05 (two-tailed). We estimated the total hospitalizations with ade to be 9 440 757 patients (6.28% of total) from 2008 to 2011. Increasing trend was noted from 2008 (5.97%) to 2011 (6.82%) with an annual percentage change rate of 4.37. Patients with ade were significantly older (2011: mean age 61.42 vs. 48.65 years) and had more comorbidities. Steroids (14.49%), antineoplastic drugs (13.06%), anticoagulants (11.33%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (8.78%), and opiates/narcotics (6.48%) were the five most common causes of ade. Patient with ade stayed 1.89 days [95% confidence interval (ci) (1.79-1.99); p < 0.001] longer, incurred $1851.44 [95%ci ($1613.90-$2088.96), p < 0.001] higher with higher odds of mortality 1.27 [95%ci (1.24-1.29), p < 0.001].

We identified live birth pregnancies using a validated algorithm, and all forms of ondansetron and other available antiemetics were identified using national drug codes or procedure codes. We assessed the prevalence of antiemetic use by trimester, calendar year, and formulation. In over 2.3 million pregnancies, the prevalence of ondansetron, promethazine, metoclopramide, or doxylamine/pyridoxine use anytime in pregnancy was 15.2, 10.3, 4.0, and 0.4%, respectively. Ondansetron use increased from <1% of pregnancies in 2001 to 22.2% in 2014, with much of the increase attributable to oral ondansetron beginning in 2006.

Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials published in five prominent medical journals during 2006-2012 were searched. Only trials that evaluated orally or parenterally administered active drugs versus placebo in a head-to-head setting were selected. For aes reported from ≥10 rpccts, pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to determine the relationship between ae rates in placebo and active-drug recipients. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to compute proportions of nonspecific aes, which were truncated at a maximum of 100%, in active-drug recipients. We included 231 trials addressing various medical domains or healthy participants. For the 88 analyzed ae variables, ae rates for placebo and active-drug recipients were in general strongly correlated (r > 0.50) or very strongly correlated (r > 0.80). The pooled proportions of nonspecific aes for the active-drug recipients were 96.8% (95%ci: 95.5-98.1) for any aes, 100% (97.9-100) for serious aes, and 77.7% (72.7-83.2) for drug-related aes. Results were similar for individual medical domains and healthy participants. The pooled proportion of nonspecificity of 82 system organ class and individual ae types ranged from 38% to 100%. The large proportion of nonspecific aes reported in active-drug recipients of rpccts, including serious and drug-related aes, highlights the limitations of clinical trial data to determine the tolerability of drugs.

Individuals born preterm used more specific medications at age 30 than those born at term. The risks of being dispensed psychotropic medications overall and the subgroups antiepileptics, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics were elevated in individuals born preterm. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, the risk was elevated in males born extremely preterm (rr 5.8; 95%ci: 2.2-15). The risk of being dispensed antiasthmatics increased by shorter gestational ages. For psychotropic medications, par% was 0.6% in males and 0.7% in females at age 30; ar% was 13% in males and 17% in females. For antiasthmatics, the corresponding figures were 1.4, 1.1, 24 and 23%. Individuals born preterm used more psychotropic medications overall and antiasthmatics around age 30 than those born at term. The proportions using these medications increased for those born at earlier gestational ages.

We also evaluated completeness of recording and further assessed reporting delays for hospitalized events in cprd. We selected guillain-barré syndrome (gbs), bell's palsy (bp), optic neuritis (on) and febrile seizures (fs), from january 2005 to june 2014. We assessed recording delays (e.g. Due to feedback from specialist referral) in stand-alone cprd by comparing the event and system dates and excluding delays >1 year. We used linked cprd-hospitalization data to further evaluate delays and completeness of recording in cprd. Among 51 220 patients for the stand-alone cprd analysis (gbs: n = 830; bp: n = 12 602; on: n = 1720; and fs: n = 36 236), most had a record entered within 1 month of the event date (gbs: 73.6%; bp: 93.4%; on: 76.2%; and fs: 85.6%).

Of these, <50% had a record in cprd after 1 year (gbs: 41.3%; bp: 22.1%; on: 22.4%; and fs: 41.8%). This work shows that most diagnoses in cprd for the conditions examined were recorded with delays of ≤30 days, making nrtvss possible. The pattern of delays was condition-specific and could be used to adjust for delays in the nrtvss analysis. Despite low sensitivity of recording, implementing nrtvss in cprd is worthwhile and could be carried out, at least on a trial basis, for events of interest. © 2017 the authors.

To determine the degree of capture of dispensings, we calculated the number of subjects with the following: (1) same number of dispensings in both databases; (2) at least one dispensing, but not all dispensings, missed in pharmetrics; and (3) all dispensings missing in pharmetrics. Similar analyses were conducted using dispensings as the unit of analysis. To assess whether a dispensing in lrx was in pharmetrics, the dispensing in pharmetrics had to be for the same medication class and within ±7 days in lrx. A total of 1 426 498 subjects were included. Overall, 68% of subjects had the same number of dispensings in both databases. In 13% of subjects, pharmetrics identified ≥1 dispensing but also missed ≥1 dispensing. In 19% of the subjects, pharmetrics missed all the dispensings. Taking dispensings as the unit of analysis, 25% of the dispensings present in lrx were not captured in pharmetrics. These patterns were similar across all four classes of medications. Of the dispensings missing in pharmetrics, 48% involved a subject who had >1 health insurance plan. Commercial claims databases provide an incomplete picture of all prescriptions dispensed to patients.

Opioid dose data was collected via a self-completed 7-day medication diary capturing names, strengths and doses of each medication taken in the past week. Median daily dose was calculated for each opioid. Comparisons were made to the world health organization's (who) ddd metric. Who ddds ranged from 0.6 to 7.1 times the median opioid doses used by the sample. For transdermal fentanyl and oral hydromorphone, the median dose was comparable with the ddd. The ddd for methadone was 0.6 times lower than the median doses used by this sample of chronic pain patients. In contrast, the ddd for oxycodone and transdermal buprenorphine, the most commonly used strong opioids for chronic pain in australia, was two to seven times higher than actual doses used. For many opioids, there are key differences between the actual doses used in clinical practice and the who's ddds. The interpretation of opioid utilisation studies using population-level ddds may be limited, and a recalibration of the ddd for many opioids or the reporting of opioid utilisation in oral morphine equivalent doses is recommended.

Data were obtained from kaiser permanente northwest and northern california. Diagnostic data from electronic health records, submitted claims, and state death records from oregon, washington, and california were linked. Individual opioid-related poisoning codes (e.g., 965.xx and x42), and adverse effects of opioids codes (e.g., e935.xx) combined with diagnoses possibly indicative of overdoses (e.g., respiratory depression), were evaluated by comparison with chart audits. Opioid adverse effects codes had low ppv to detect overdoses (13.4%) as assessed in 127 charts and were not pursued. Instead, opioid poisoning codes were assessed in 2100 individuals who had those codes present in electronic health records in the period between the years 2008 and 2012. Of these, 10/2100 had no available information and 241/2100 were excluded potentially as anesthesia-related. Among the 1849 remaining individuals with opioid poisoning codes, 1495 events were accurately identified as opioid overdoses; 69 were miscodes or misidentified, and 285 were opioid adverse effects, not overdoses. Thus, ppv was 81%. Opioid adverse effects or overdoses were accurately identified in 1780 of 1849 events (96.3%). Opioid poisoning codes have a predictive value of 81% to identify opioid overdoses, suggesting icd opioid poisoning codes can be used to monitor overdose rates and evaluate interventions to reduce overdose. Further research to assess sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value are ongoing. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28074520

Individual case safety reports (icsrs) reported by healthcare professionals to the national pharmacovigilance database 2008-2011 were related to defined daily dose (ddd) in the swedish prescribed drug register (spdr) for individual's ≥20 years. Data were stratified into five age groups. Crude and adjusted (by age standardisation of prescribed drugs) reporting rate (rr) and reporting rate ratio was evaluated as well as impact of sex-dependent drugs. Based on 9898 included icsrs, the crude results show that overall rr was almost similar for both serious and non-serious reports and indicates highest rr in the youngest age group. Women had higher rates than men, with predominance for non-serious reports, contrary to men who had a higher rr of serious ones. Standardisation led partly to the same result, but age-related distribution was adjusted, with highest overall rr in the oldest age groups. Sex-dependent drugs had marginal impact on the results. Age and sex have impact on spontaneous reporting of adrs. After adjusting for dispensed drugs and by standardisation of age-related differences in prescribed drugs, results indicate that healthcare professionals more frequently reported adrs for the oldest individuals and for women. Serious reports were more frequently reported for men. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28071845

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of concomitant use of ccbs and clopidogrel on risks of acute coronary syndrome (acs) re-hospitalization in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention. Using the taiwan national health insurance research database, we identified 51 925 patients who were admitted for newly diagnosed acs, received percutaneous coronary intervention, and used clopidogrel within 1 year after discharge. We further stratified them into three groups based on their uses of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications for acs (fully, partially, and non-compliant groups) to assess the potential modification effect of guideline compliance. For each group, we conducted a 1:1 propensity score matching to minimize selection bias. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the effect of concomitant use of ccbs (overall, subclasses, and individual ccbs) and clopidogrel on risks of acs re-hospitalization. Concomitant use of ccbs in patients discharged with clopidogrel was significantly associated with a lower risk of acs re-hospitalization in the fully compliant group (hr   = 0.82 [95% confidence interval 0.75-0.89], p < 0.001) but was associated with increased risk of acs re-hospitalization in the non-compliant group (hr   = 1.22 [1.03-1.45], p = 0.0252). Different guideline compliance of secondary prevention medications could modify the potential drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and ccbs. Concomitant use of ccbs and clopidogrel was significantly associated with increased risk of acs re-hospitalization in acs patients not compliant to guideline-recommended secondary prevention drugs.

We present definitions and prevalence estimates for major structural birth defects to be used in studies of maternal vaccine safety. In this observational study, we created and refined algorithms for identifying major structural birth defects from electronic healthcare data, conducted formal chart reviews for severe cardiac defects, and conducted limited chart validation for other defects. We estimated prevalence for selected defects by vsd site and birth year and compared these estimates to those in a us and european surveillance system. We developed algorithms to enumerate >50 major structural birth defects from standardized administrative and healthcare data based on utilization patterns and expert opinion, applying criteria for number, timing, and setting of diagnoses. Our birth cohort included 497 894 infants across seven sites. The period prevalence for all selected major birth defects in the vsd from 2004 to 2013 was 1.7 per 100 live births. Cardiac defects were most common (65.4 per 10 000 live births), with one-fourth classified as severe, requiring emergent intervention. For most major structural birth defects, prevalence estimates were stable over time and across sites and similar to those reported in other population-based surveillance systems. Our algorithms can efficiently identify many major structural birth defects in large healthcare datasets and can be used in studies evaluating the safety of vaccines administered to pregnant women.

The association between aed use and sa was explored using multivariate conditional logistic regression. The analyses were replicated after stratification on depression and neurological disorders (epilepsy, migraine, and chronic neuropathic pain). Between 2008 and 2012, 506 adults with an incident sa were recruited in suicide treatment centers from across france and socio-demographically matched to 2829 controls from primary care settings. The association between aed use and odds of sa was not significant overall (odds ratio [or], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.9-2.4).

Our results suggest that the association observed between aed use and increased odds of non-fatal sa in patients with either a lifetime history of depression or no neurological disorder may be explained by the presence of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Accounting for underlying indications is crucial in drug safety studies, as these can cause a reported association (or lack thereof) to be misleading.

The first key variable was an exposure variable, intracameral antibiotic injection. The second was an intraoperative complication, posterior capsular rupture (pcr), which functioned as a potential confounder. To help other researchers use nlp in their settings, we describe our nlp protocol and lessons learned. For each of the two variables, we used sas text miner and other sas text-processing modules with a training set of 10 000 (1.3%) operative notes to develop a lexicon. The lexica identified misspellings, abbreviations, and negations, and linked words into concepts (e.g. ""antibiotic"" linked with ""injection""). We confirmed the nlp tools by iteratively obtaining random samples of 2000 (0.3%) notes, with replacement. The nlp tools identified approximately 60 000 intracameral antibiotic injections and 3500 cases of pcr. The positive and negative predictive values for intracameral antibiotic injection exceeded 99%. For the intraoperative complication, they exceeded 94%. Nlp was a valid and feasible method for obtaining critical variables needed for a research study of surgical safety.

Time varying disease activity was measured using clinical disease activity index (cdai); outcomes included all-cause hospitalization, a composite of hospitalization or emergency department (ed) visits, mortality, and medical costs. Outcome-specific cox proportional models evaluated the adjusted hazard ratios between disease activity and outcomes, controlling for potential confounders including comorbidities grouped into four patient phenotypes. Costs were analyzed with mixed models using a gaussian distribution with log transformation. Depending on outcome, 4593 ra patients contributed up to 12 001 person years. Median age was 71 years, 75% women. At baseline, approximately 50-60% of patients were in remission or low disease activity. There was a dose-response relationship between ra disease activity (remission, low, moderate, and high) and the incidence of hospitalizations (13.1, 17.8, 21.2, 27.5 per 100 py, respectively); all adjusted hazard ratios were significant: 0.68 (remission), 0.87 (low), and 1.24 (high) compared with moderate disease activity. Similar trends were observed for ed visits and mortality. The crude difference in annual medical costs between remission ($11 145) and moderate disease activity ($17 646) was $-6 500; the adjusted difference (95%ci) was $-3133 (-4737.72, -1528.43). Leveraging the benefits of linking registry and administrative data together, lower disease activity in ra was associated with incrementally reduced risks of all-cause hospitalization, ed visits, mortality, and medical costs in a dose-dependent fashion.

Pooled results were analyzed by the coordinating center. Asthma deaths were ascertained by linkage with the national death index. In a cohort of 994 627 persistent asthma patients (2.4 million person-years; 278 asthma deaths), probabilities of the upper 95% confidence limit for effect estimates being less than targeted values, assuming a null relation, were about 0.05.

The evaluable study cohort (n = 2748) was derived from the database of the largest health insurance provider in the slovak republic. Patients aged ≥65 years who were initiated on statin therapy following the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke during one full year (1 january 2010 to 31 december 2010) constituted this cohort. Each patient was followed for a period of 3 years from the date of the first statin prescription. Patients with a continuous treatment gap of 6 months without statin prescription were designated as non-persistent. The cox proportional hazard model was applied to determine patient-associated characteristics that influenced the likelihood of non-persistence. During the 3-year follow-up period, 39.7% of patients in the study cohort became non-persistent. Factors associated with decreased probability of a patient becoming non-persistent were age ≥75 years (hazard ratio (hr) 0.75), polypharmacy (concurrent use of ≥6 drugs) (hr 0.79), diabetes mellitus (hr 0.80), dementia (hr 0.81) and hypercholesterolemia (hr 0.50). On the other hand, the presence of anxiety disorders (hr 1.33) predicted an increased likelihood of a patient being non-persistent. Our findings suggest that patients aged ≥75 years or those with the presence of diabetes mellitus, dementia, hypercholesterolemia or polypharmacy were likely to be persistent with statin therapy, whereas those with anxiety disorders may need greater assistance with persistence of statin therapy.

The prioritization criteria were extracted and classified in relevant categories. From an initial set of 63 articles, 11 were retained for full review. The articles mentioned 48 criteria used in the prioritization process, with a median of six criteria per study [range: 1-16]. More than half of the criteria (63%), referred to strength of evidence while 19% related to public health impact, 14% to general public and media attention and 4% to novelty of the drug event association. Fifteen criteria were tested for predictive value with 11 showing positive results, most of them from the strength of evidence category. Six decision-making frameworks are presented, which incorporate criteria from various categories. Five of these frameworks were tested against expert decisions or by other means, but only in one database each and for a limited set of products. There is a wide range of prioritization criteria described in the literature; however, few of them demonstrated predictive value. Many criteria with predictive value were related to strength of evidence category and to novelty. There were few attempts at integrating different criteria in decision support frameworks. Five of the frameworks were tested for validity and showed usefulness, while at least three are already in use for prioritization. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27878889

The present study examined antidepressant use in pediatric patients aged 0 to 17 years over time, investigated changes regarding the prescribed drugs, analyzed underlying diagnoses, and assessed the rate of off-label use. We used claims data of roughly two million individuals to calculate annual prevalence and incidence rates of antidepressant prescriptions for the years 2004 to 2011. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, and drug type. For antidepressant users, numbers of prescriptions, frequencies of disorders/diseases, and specialties of the prescribing physicians were examined. The share of off-label prescriptions was calculated for each year. The prescription prevalence of antidepressants ranged between 1.7 and 2.1 per 1000 minors. The use of tricyclic antidepressants decreased from 0.9 to 0.6 prescriptions per 1000 minors, while the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increased from 0.5 to 1.1. Of the patients with an antidepressant prescription, 46.4% only received one prescription. Depression was by far the most frequent diagnosis among all antidepressant users as well as among subjects with only one prescription. In 2011, 36.3% of all prescriptions were off-label. The high proportion of single prescriptions, even in patients with a diagnosed depression, and the high rate of off-label use are particularly noteworthy and should be further investigated in future studies.

We applied functional data analysis, a statistical framework developed for analysing curve data, to investigate weekly temporal patterns in wastewater measurements of three prescription drugs with known abuse potential: methadone, oxazepam and methylphenidate, comparing them to positive and negative control drugs. Sewage samples were collected in february 2014 from a wastewater treatment plant in oslo, norway. The weekly pattern of each drug was extracted by fitting of generalized additive models, using trigonometric functions to model the cyclic behaviour. From the weekly component, the main temporal features were then extracted using functional principal component analysis. Results are presented through the functional principal components (fpcs) and corresponding fpc scores. Clinically, the most important weekly feature of the wastewater-based epidemiology data was the second fpc, representing the difference between average midweek level and a peak during the weekend, representing possible recreational use of a drug in the weekend. Estimated scores on this fpc indicated recreational use of methylphenidate, with a high weekend peak, but not for methadone and oxazepam. The functional principal component analysis uncovered clinically important temporal features of the weekly patterns of the use of prescription drugs detected from wastewater analysis. This may be used as a post-marketing surveillance method to monitor prescription drugs with abuse potential. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27862608

In all, 278 205 individuals (median age: 74 years; 55% female; median 3 drugs per person; 5% nursing home residents, 11% with multi-dose drug dispensing) were included in the analyses, 32 421 (12%) of whom were on long-term treatment with ppi in 2010. For 12 253 individuals (38%) with such treatment, no underlying rationale was found. In individuals without a disease- or a drug-related reason for ppi use, nursing home residence, number of drugs, female sex, but not multi-dose drug dispensing, were associated with long-term use of ppi; adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval): 1.63 (1.49; 1.78), 1.27 (1.26; 1.28), 1.24 (1.19; 1.29), and 0.94 (0.88; 1.01), respectively. Long-term use of ppi occurs in one out of nine individuals in the older population. For four out of ten of these, no reason for ppi use can be identified. Nursing home residence, female sex, and greater number of drugs predict non-rational long-term use of ppi. © 2016 the authors.

However, a lack of data persists in assessing whether carvedilol or bisoprolol are superior to metoprolol tartrate in clinical practice. We endeavored to compare the effectiveness of β-blockers among older adults following a primary hospital admission for hf. We conducted a cohort study using quebec administrative databases to identify patients who were using β-blockers, carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol tartrate after the diagnosis of hf. We characterized the patients by the type of β-blocker prescribed at discharge of their first hf hospitalization. An adjusted multivariate cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. We also conducted analyses by matching for a propensity score for initiation of β-blocker therapy and assessed the effect on primary outcome. Among 3197 patients with hf with a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the crude annual mortality rates (per 100 person-years) were at 16, 14.9, and 17.7 for metoprolol tartrate, carvedilol, and bisoprolol, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios of carvedilol (hazard ratio 0.92; 0.78-1.09) and bisoprolol (hazard ratio 1.04; 0.93-1.16) were not significantly different from that of metoprolol tartrate in improving survival. After matching for propensity score, carvedilol and bisoprolol showed no additional benefit with respect to all-cause mortality compared with metoprolol tartrate. Our evidence suggests no differential effect of β-blockers on all-cause mortality among older adults with hf. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27859924

A cross-sectional study regarding outpatient pharmaceutical care was conducted at a medical center in taiwan. Patients aged >20 years old with multiple chronic diseases and polypharmacy were enrolled. In stage i (1 october-31 december 2014), patients received pharmaceutical care according to prescription data accessed online in the vmrcs. In stage ii (1 june-31 august 2015), the vmrcs were pre-download and arranged to the institute's required format, facilitated drp detection. Clinical pharmacists then reviewed and evaluated the prescription data through pre-downloaded vmrcs. Overall, 1539 and 1600 prescriptions were evaluated in these two stages, respectively. Drps were recorded using the pharmaceutical care network europe (pcne)-drp. Drps were found for 50.2% of patients in stage i and 55.2% in stage ii (p < 0.05) and were most frequently encountered for ""drugs for the cardiovascular system"" and caused by ""inappropriate duplication of therapeutic group or active ingredient."" in terms of problems, incidence of ""unnecessary drug treatment"" was highest. Duplicate medications were most frequently seen for ""drugs for acid-related disorders."" the efficiency to identify drps was at least 2.4 times higher with pre-downloaded prescription data than with real-time online queries. With vmrcs, drps were more easily identified whether patients received medical care in the same hospital or not. Drps could be efficiently prevented through the use of pre-downloaded patient prescription data. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27730699

We assessed whether statin use decreases the incidence of adverse influenza-related outcomes. Additionally, we used a new-user study design to minimize healthy user bias. We further examined the possibility of non-causal associations by using unrelated outcomes. We used the uk clinical practice research datalink to identify all patients aged 30 or older diagnosed with influenza-like illness during 1997-2010. Statin users were compared with propensity score-matched patients not receiving statins. The outcome was hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia or death in the 30 days following influenza diagnosis. Logistic regression estimated cumulative incidence ratios. The study cohort included 5181 statin users matched to 5181 non-users. The 30-day incidence of hospitalization or death was 3.5% in statin users and 5.2% in non-users, resulting in a 27% lower incidence with statin use (cumulative incidence ratio: 0.73, 95%ci: 0.59-0.89). New statin users were less protected against our composite outcome. The effect of statins was less pronounced among those with respiratory and cardiac disease. Statin use was shown to be associated with a non-statistically significant risk reduction of motor vehicle accident and burns. The attenuation of the effect of statins with the new-user design, supporting evidence from the assessment of effect modification, and additional sub-analyses evaluating the effect of statins on non-related outcomes suggest that the beneficial effect of statins on influenza-related adverse outcomes may be explained by a healthy user bias.

A drug utilization cohort study.","Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety","10.1002/pds.4110","Following a tv documentary in 2013, there was a tremendous increase in low dose naltrexone (ldn) use in a wide range of unapproved indications in norway. We aim to describe the extent of this sudden and unprecedented increase in ldn prescribing, to characterize patients and ldn prescribers, and to estimate ldn dose sizes. Ldn prescriptions recorded in the norwegian prescription database (norpd) in 2013 and 2014, and sales data not recorded in norpd from the only norwegian ldn manufacturer were included in the study. According to norpd, 15 297 patients (0.3% of population) collected at least one ldn prescription. The actual number of users was higher as at least 23% of total sales were not recorded in norpd. After an initial wave, there was a steady stream of new and persistent users throughout the study period. Median patient age was 52 years, and 74% of patients were female. Median daily dose was 3.7 mg. Twenty percent of all doctors and 71% of general medicine practitioners registered in norway in 2014 prescribed ldn at least once. The tv documentary on ldn in norway was followed by a large increase in ldn prescribing, and the proportion of ldn users went from an insignificant number to 0.3% of the population. There was a high willingness to use and prescribe off label despite limited evidence. Observed median ldn dose, and age and gender distribution were as expected in typical ldn using patients. © 2016 the authors.

However, the desired contrast often involves one new drug compared with an older drug, of which many users of the new drug may have switched from, seriously restricting the scope of incident new-user studies. We introduce prevalent new-user cohort designs for head-to-head comparative drug effect studies, where incident new users are scarce. We define time-based and prescription-based exposure sets to compute time-conditional propensity scores of initiating the newer drug and to identify matched subjects receiving the comparator drug. We illustrate this approach using data from the uk's clinical practice research datalink to evaluate whether the newer glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (glp-1 analogs) used to treat type 2 diabetes increase the risk of heart failure, in comparison with the older similarly indicated sulfonylureas. Of the 170 031 users of antidiabetic agents from 2000 onwards, 79 682 used sulfonylureas (first use 2000), while 6196 used glp-1 analogs (first use 2007), 75% of which had previously used a sulfonylurea. After matching each glp-1 analog user to a sulfonylurea user on the time-conditional propensity scores from prescription-based exposure sets, the hazard ratio of heart failure with glp-1 use was 0.73 (95%ci: 0.57-0.93). The proposed prevalent new-user cohort design for comparative drug effects studies allows the use of all or most patients exposed to the newer drug, thus permitting a more comprehensive assessment of a new drug's safety.

Results from dutch ae studies showed that-despite various improvement initiatives-the incidence of preventable mraes did not decline. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of mraes during hospitalizations using national patient data from records of patients admitted to dutch hospitals in 2008 and 2011/2012. Trained nurses and physicians reviewed the randomly selected records of 8071 patients admitted to one of 20 hospitals in 2008 or 2011/2012 during a two-stage review process. Patient and admission characteristics were collected. After identification of a mrae, physicians determined their potential preventability, drug type, related prescribing factors, and potential consequences. The physicians identified 928 adverse events (aes) in 857 admissions, of which 218 (15.2%) were medication-related. They judged 55 (18.4%) of these as preventable. Preventability of mraes was high in anticoagulant treatment (42.5%). Haematoma (39.0%) and intra-cerebral haemorrhage (25.5%) were common types of anticoagulant-related aes. Anticoagulant-related aes were often related to dosage factors (46.9%) and often resulted in an intervention (80.2%), of which 40.2% was judged as preventable. This study provided detailed information on mraes during hospital admissions in the netherlands. A substantial proportion of aes was medication-related (15.2%), of which 18.4% was judged to be preventable. As preventability in mraes was especially high in anticoagulant treatment (42.5%), those medications are a threat to patient safety. Future research and new safety programs should focus on prevention of aes related to this medication group. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27193415
