We aimed to inform the development of a decision aid on oral corticosteroid (ocs) use during pregnancy through focus groups. We invited patients from one health system who had a recent live birth and a condition for which ocss may be prescribed (ie, asthma or other autoimmune disease) to participate in focus groups. We conducted conventional qualitative content analysis of verbatim transcripts of the focus groups using inductive coding. There were 30 participants across five focus groups from may to june 2019. Women endorsed the need for patient-provider discussions about ocs use during pregnancy in which the provider shares risks and benefits and the patient makes her decision. Furthermore, women generally expressed support for patient-centered handouts about ocs use during pregnancy that the provider discusses with the patient. When considering whether to take ocss in pregnancy, women had concerns about: the medication's impact on their baby (eg, miscarriage, birth defects, long-term effects), themselves (eg, effects on mood, sleep, weight gain), pregnancy complications (eg, preterm birth, increased blood pressure), and lactation. Women wanted information on ocss (eg, indications, length of treatment, and cost), alternative treatments, and risks of not taking ocss. We established patient need for a decision aid on ocs use during pregnancy that providers can discuss with patients. To address patient concerns, the aid should at a minimum describe the medication's impact on baby, including long-term effects, maternal health, pregnancy complications, and lactation.",33314542

We assessed the association between hctz exposure and risk of malignant melanoma (mm) and keratinocyte carcinoma (kc) in a european mediterranean population. Two parallel nested case-control studies were conducted in spain using two electronic primary healthcare databases, each one providing data on both exposure and outcomes: sidiap and bifap. Cancer cases were matched to 10 controls by age and gender through risk-set sampling. The ors and 95% ci for mm and kc associated with previous hctz use were estimated using conditional logistic regression. In bifap, kc cases were further identified as basal cell carcinoma (bcc) or squamous cell carcinoma (scc). In adjusted analyses, both ever and cumulative high (‰ä´50,000‰Ûämg) use of hctz were associated with an increased risk of kc. The risk estimates for high use were 1.30 (1.26-1.34) in sidiap and 1.20 (1.12-1.30) in bifap, with a lower risk for bcc (1.11 [1.02-1.21]) than for scc (1.71 [1.45-2.02]). A dose-response relationship was observed between cumulative doses of hctz and kc risk. Inconsistent results were found for high use of hctz and risk of mm: 1.25 (1.09-1.43) in sidiap and 0.85 (0.64-1.13) in bifap. In this european mediterranean population, a high cumulative use of hctz was related to an increased risk of kc with a clear dose-response pattern.",34015159

However, a lack of data persists in assessing whether carvedilol or bisoprolol are superior to metoprolol tartrate in clinical practice. We endeavored to compare the effectiveness of ë_-blockers among older adults following a primary hospital admission for hf. We conducted a cohort study using quebec administrative databases to identify patients who were using ë_-blockers, carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol tartrate after the diagnosis of hf. We characterized the patients by the type of ë_-blocker prescribed at discharge of their first hf hospitalization. An adjusted multivariate cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. We also conducted analyses by matching for a propensity score for initiation of ë_-blocker therapy and assessed the effect on primary outcome. Among 3197 patients with hf with a median follow-up of 2.8‰Ûäyears, the crude annual mortality rates (per 100 person-years) were at 16, 14.9, and 17.7 for metoprolol tartrate, carvedilol, and bisoprolol, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios of carvedilol (hazard ratio 0.92; 0.78-1.09) and bisoprolol (hazard ratio 1.04; 0.93-1.16) were not significantly different from that of metoprolol tartrate in improving survival. After matching for propensity score, carvedilol and bisoprolol showed no additional benefit with respect to all-cause mortality compared with metoprolol tartrate. Our evidence suggests no differential effect of ë_-blockers on all-cause mortality among older adults with hf. Copyright å© 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27859924

Previous studies have reported no increase in risk of miscarriage but relied on methods that failed to account for gestational weeks at risk and non-user comparators, which may increase the potential for unmeasured confounding. Our objective was to estimate the risk of miscarriage among women prescribed ondansetron vs alternative antiemetics during the first 20‰Ûäweeks of pregnancy. A pregnancy cohort was created using electronic health record data from a health care system in north carolina. Women were classified as exposed to either ondansetron or comparator antiemetics (metoclopramide or promethazine) based on the first antiemetic prescription received in the first 20‰Ûäweeks of gestation. Cumulative incidence of miscarriage at 20‰Ûäweeks was estimated in each antiemetic group. Hazard ratios (hr) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals and measured confounding was controlled using inverse probability of treatment weights. Sensitivity analyses assessed the potential impact of exposure misclassification, latency period, and selection bias. We identified 2620 eligible pregnancies with antiemetic orders; 65% had a first ondansetron order and 35% had a first comparator antiemetic order. In total, 95 women had a miscarriage. After adjustment, there was no difference in risk of miscarriage (hr 1.21, 95% ci 0.77, 1.90). Results from the per-protocol and other sensitivity analyses were similar to the main analysis. We did not observe an increase in the risk of miscarriage for pregnancies exposed to ondansetron vs comparator antiemetics.",33000871

The university of florida health integrated data repository from june 2011 and july 2018 was used to assess temporal prescribing of dh ccb and loop diuretics within the prescription sequence symmetry analysis framework. Validation of the prescribing cascade was performed via clinical expert chart review. Among patients without heart failure who were initiated on dh ccb, 26 and 64 loop diuretics initiators started within 360‰Ûädays before versus after dh ccb initiation, respectively, resulting in an adjusted sequence ratio (asr) of 2.27 (95% ci, 1.44-3.58). Overall, 35 (54.7%) patients were determined to have a prescribing cascade. Removing patients who experienced a prescribing cascade resulted in an asr of 1.05, 95% ci 0.62-1.78). Loop diuretic initiation rates before and after dh ccb initiation for reasons other a prescribing cascade were similar, thus confirming the prescription sequence symmetry analysis assumption.",34553438

We queried english-language articles from pubmed, web of science, clinicaltrials.gov, and the cdc library of gray literature databases using keywords of ""coronavirus,"" ""covid,"" ""clinical trial"" and ""randomized controlled trial"" from january 2020 to june 2021. From the search, we conducted an initial review to rule-out duplicate entries, identify those that met inclusion criteria (i.e., had results), and exclude those that did not meet the definition of an rct. Lastly, we abstracted the demographic and clinical characteristics reported on within each rct. From the initial 43‰Ûä627 manuscripts, our final eligible manuscripts consisted of 149 rcts described in 137 articles. Most of the rcts (113/149) studied potential treatments, while fewer studied vaccines (29), prophylaxis strategies (5), and interventions to prevent transmission among those infected (2). Study populations ranged from 10 to 38‰Ûä206 participants (medianåÊ=åÊ100, iqr: 60-300). All 149 rcts reported on age, 147 on sex, 50 on race, and 110 on the prevalence of at least one comorbidity. No rcts reported on income, urban versus rural residence, or other indicators of socioeconomic status (ses). Limited reporting on race and other markers of ses make it difficult to draw conclusions about specific external target populations without making strong assumptions that treatment effects are homogenous. These findings highlight the need for more robust reporting on the clinical and demographic profiles of patients enrolled in covid-19 related rcts.",35996832

Over more than a decade, sentinel has become an integral part of fda's surveillance capabilities and has been used to conduct analyses that have contributed to regulatory decisions. Fda's role in the covid-19 pandemic response has necessitated an expansion and enhancement of sentinel. Here we describe how the sentinel system has supported fda's response to the covid-19 pandemic. We highlight new capabilities developed, key data generated to date, and lessons learned, particularly with respect to working with inpatient electronic health record data. Early in the pandemic, sentinel developed a multi-pronged approach to support fda's anticipated data and analytic needs. It incorporated new data sources, created a rapidly refreshed database, developed protocols to assess the natural history of covid-19, validated a diagnosis-code based algorithm for identifying patients with covid-19 in administrative claims data, and coordinated with other national and international initiatives. Sentinel is poised to answer important questions about the natural history of covid-19 and is positioned to use this information to study the use, safety, and potentially the effectiveness of medical products used for covid-19 prevention and treatment.",33797815

We used simulations to compare fixed-duration versus all-available caps for confounder adjustment in the presence of differences in available baseline time between exposure groups. We simulated cohorts of 10åÊ000 patients with binary variables for a single confounder, exposure, and outcome. Baseline time was simulated based on the observed distribution in a claims-based comparison of statin users versus nonusers. We compared bias after measuring confounders using fixed-duration and all-available caps, both when exposure groups had similar and discrepant amounts of available baseline time. When the comparison groups had similar amounts of baseline time, an all-available cap was less biased than a fixed-duration cap. When baseline time differed between comparison groups, the preferable cap approach depended on the direction of confounding and which exposure group had higher covariate sensitivity. These findings were consistent in direction across sensitivity analyses. In certain settings of differential available baseline time between exposure groups, the all-available cap was more biased than the fixed-duration cap. The relative directions and strengths of confounding and misclassification biases are an important consideration when choosing between a fixed-duration or all-available cap, but they are often unknown. Therefore, we recommend comparing the amount of available baseline time between exposure groups. When there is a large discrepancy, despite appropriate design choices, we recommend a fixed-duration approach to avoid potential increases in bias because of differential data availability.",30786103

We linked information on statin prescriptions from the aarhus university prescription database with the cancer cohorts from aalborg university hospital. For statin-prescribed patients, we calculated a prescription window covering the anticipated duration of the prescription. For each statin-prescribed patient with at least one blood sample in a prescription window, we selected without replacement a never-statin-prescribed patient matched on sex, age, and calendar year of surgery. Each of the selected blood samples were analyzed using assays to detect statins. We calculated the positive and negative predictive value of the prescription registry reporting using the assay result as the gold standard. We identified 73 ever-statin-prescribed patients with a total of 253 blood samples and 74 blood samples among never-statin-prescribed patients. The positive predictive value for prescribed patients, with presence of statins in at least one blood sample as the gold standard, was 93% (95% ci, 86%-97%) and the negative predictive value was 93% (95% ci, 86%-97%). Stratified results did not reveal substantial differences in predictive values. Fifty-two (71%) of the statin-prescribed patients had statins in every blood sample, suggesting continuous adherence. This study showed a high adherence with treatment with statins among colorectal cancer patients.",30779395

Population-based study including women with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis, and their infants born 2006 to 2013 from the national health registers in denmark, finland, and sweden. Women treated with anti-tnf were compared with women with nonbiologic systemic treatment. Adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab were compared pairwise. Continuation of treatment in early pregnancy was compared with discontinuation. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated in logistic regression models adjusted for country and maternal characteristics. Among 1 633 909 births, 1027 infants were to women treated with anti-tnf and 9399 to women with nonbiologic systemic treatment. Compared with non-biologic systemic treatment, women with anti-tnf treatment had a higher risk of preterm birth, odds ratio 1.61 (1.29-2.02) and caesarean section, 1.57 (1.35-1.82). The odds ratio for small for gestational age was 1.36 (0.96-1.92). In pairwise comparisons, infliximab was associated with a higher risk of severely small for gestational age for inflammatory joint and skin diseases but not for inflammatory bowel disease. Discontinuation of anti-tnf had opposite effects on preterm birth for inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory joint and skin diseases. Anti-tnf agents were associated with increased risks of preterm birth, caesarean section, and small for gestational age. However, the diverse findings across disease groups may indicate an association related to the underlying disease activity, rather than to agent-specific effects.",32020767

We conducted a simulation study to examine how avoiding sharing individual-level data in a distributed data network can affect analytic results. The base scenario had four sites of varying sizes with 5% outcome incidence, 50% treatment prevalence, and seven confounders. We varied treatment prevalence, outcome incidence, treatment effect, site size, number of sites, and covariate distribution. Confounding adjustment was conducted using propensity score or disease risk score. We compared analyses of three types of aggregate-level data requested from sites: risk-set, summary-table, or effect-estimate data (meta-analysis) with benchmark results of analysis of pooled individual-level data. We assessed bias and precision of hazard ratio estimates as well as the accuracy of standard error estimates. All the aggregate-level data-sharing approaches, regardless of confounding adjustment methods, successfully approximated pooled individual-level data analysis in most simulation scenarios. Meta-analysis showed minor bias when using inverse probability of treatment weights (iptw) in infrequent exposure (5%), rare outcome (0.01%), and small site (5,000 patients) settings. Se estimates became less accurate for iptw risk-set approach with less frequent exposure and for propensity score-matching meta-analysis approach with rare outcomes. Overall, we found that we can avoid sharing individual-level data and obtain valid results in many settings, although care must be taken with meta-analysis approach in infrequent exposure and rare outcome scenarios, particularly when confounding adjustment is performed with iptw.",30022561

Retrospective cohort study of 335åÊ041 children ‰ä_18åÊyears using ehr primary care data from 2 pediatric health systems (2011-2013). A series of monthly pseudotrials were created, using propensity score methodology to balance baseline characteristics between saba-exposed (identified by prescription) and saba-unexposed children. Association between saba and subsequent arrhythmia for each health system was estimated through pooled logistic regression with separate estimates for children initiating under and over 4åÊyears old (off-label and on-label, respectively). Eleven percent of the cohort received a saba prescription, 57% occurred under the age of 4åÊyears (off-label). During the follow-up period, there were 283 first arrhythmia events, most commonly atrial tachyarrhythmias and premature ventricular/atrial contractions. In 1 health system, adjusted risk for arrhythmia was increased among exposed children (or 1.89, 95% ci 1.31-2.73) without evidence of interaction between label status and risk. The absolute adjusted rate difference was 3.6/10åÊ000 person-years of saba exposure. The association between saba exposure and arrhythmias was less strong in the second system (or 1.26, 95% ci 0.30-5.33). Using ehr data, we could estimate the risk of a rare event associated with medication use and determine difference in risk related to on-label versus off-label status.

The purpose of this narrative review is to examine evidence from studies evaluating the patient or public health impact of federal and state opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines and laws, describe gaps and challenges in current research, and highlight opportunities for improving future research. We focused on evidence from a literature review covering 2013 through 2019. We identified 30 studies evaluating opioid analgesic thresholds based on federal policies and guidelines, state laws, and medicaid state plans that attempt to influence the course of patient care at or when the limit is exceeded (e.g., prior authorization). Most studies evaluated changes in prescribing or dispensing patterns of opioid analgesics, largely finding decreases in prescribing after policy enactment. Fewer studies evaluated patient or public health outcomes beyond changes in prescribing and dispensing patterns; results were infrequently stratified by potentially important sociodemographic and clinical factors. No studies assessed the potential for adverse patient outcomes for which we have emerging evidence of harms. We describe knowledge gaps and propose opportunities for future research to sufficiently assess the potential impact and unintended consequences of opioid analgesic prescribing laws, regulations, guidelines, and policies.",35247021

The aim of the current study was to explore the effect of an intervention program on the knowledge and attitudes among physicians and nurses regarding adrs reporting. A multicentre study consisted of three phases: filling out a questionnaire; an intervention program; filling out the same questionnaire again. The intervention program consisted of posters, lectures, and distant electronic learning. The questionnaire contained questions about personal/professional demographic variables, and statements regarding knowledge and attitudes regarding adr reporting. The data revealed that the intervention program significantly elevated the ""objective knowledge"" (p‰Ûä<‰Ûä0.01) and ""practical knowledge"" (p‰Ûä<‰Ûä0.02) score as compared to the control group, while no significant differences were found regarding ""acquired knowledge"" (p = 0.14). Seniority (p = 0.01) and experience in internal medicine (p = 0.05) were demonstrated as significant factors determining the knowledge of the staff. Obligation was the main motive for reporting in 80% of participants. After the intervention, no differences were found in the ""attitude related to the motive for reporting"" or ""attitude related to the commitment to report"", between the two groups. However, ""attitude related to the need to report"" score significantly improved after the intervention (p = 0.04). The intervention program increased knowledge and attitudes regarding adrs reports.

We conducted a cohort study using the clinical practice research datalink: a repository of electronic health records from uk primary care. We identified patients newly prescribed fourth-line anti-hypertensive drugs (aldosterone antagonist , beta-blocker, or alpha-blocker). Using propensity score-adjusted cox proportional hazards models, we compared the incidence of the primary outcome (composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction) between patients on different fourth-line drugs. Aa was the reference drug in all comparisons. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome, blood pressure changes, and heart failure. We used a negative control outcome, herpes zoster, to detect unmeasured confounding. Overall, 8639 patients were included. In propensity score-adjusted analyses, the hazard ratio for the primary outcome was 0.81 (95% ci, 0.55-1.19) for beta-blockers and 0.68 (95% ci, 0.46-0.96) for alpha-blockers versus aa. Findings for individual cardiovascular outcomes trended in a more plausible direction, albeit imprecise. A trend for a protective effect for herpes zoster across both comparisons was seen. A higher rate of all-cause death in the aa group was likely due to unmeasured confounding in our analysis of the composite primary outcome, supported by our negative outcome analysis. Results for cardiovascular outcomes were plausible, but imprecise due to small cohort sizes and a low number of observed outcomes.",31313390

However, to provide reliable estimates, hf patients must be adequately identified. This validation study aimed to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the international classification of diseases, tenth revision (icd-10) codes i50.x, heart failure, in the french hospital discharge diagnoses database. This study was performed in two university hospitals, comparing recorded discharge diagnoses and electronic health records (ehrs). Patients with discharge icd-10 codes 150.x were randomly selected. Their ehrs were reviewed to classify hf diagnosis as definite, potential, or miscoded based on the european society of cardiology diagnostic criteria, from which the codes' positive predictive value (ppv) was computed. To estimate sensitivity, patients with an ehr hf diagnosis were identified, and the presence of the i50.x codes was sought for in the hospital discharge database. Two hundred possible cases of hf were selected from the hospital discharge database, and 229 patients with an hf diagnosis were identified from the ehr. The ppv of i50.x codes was 60.5% (95% ci, 53.7%-67.3%) for definite hf and 88.0% (95% ci, 83.5%-92.5%) for definite/potential hf. The sensitivity of i50.x codes was 64.2% (95% ci, 58.0%-70.4%). Ppv results were similar in both hospitals; sensitivity depended on the source of ehr: departments of cardiology had a higher sensitivity than had nonspecialized wards. Diagnosis codes i50.x in discharge summary databases accurately identify patients with hf but fail to capture some of them.",30395375

High rates of drug use in ids have been reported. Despite the increasing interest in health problems in individuals with ids, little is known about their drug use. Drug use in a community sample of adults with ids (nåÊ=åÊ593) was compared with dispensed drugs in a time-, age-, and region-matched comparison group of adults in western norway (nåÊ=åÊ289åÊ325). A logistic regression model was employed by using the main group effect to describe and analyze the differences between the id sample and the comparison sample and by using the interaction term (groupåÊÌÑåÊage) to describe the rate change differences from the reference age (18-30åÊyears) between the two groups. Total drug use in the id sample was 62% compared with 50% in the reference sample (påÊ=åÊ0.0001). The high prevalence of drugs for the nervous system (atc n) in the id sample (50%) explained the difference. From age 51 and over, the increase in the drug use rate for the cardiovascular disease was significantly lower in the id sample than in the reference sample (p value range: 0.002-0.019). Adults with ids use more drugs than adults in general. However, the findings showed lower rates of drug use in the id sample than in the general population for drugs targeting diseases that are the leading causes of death in individuals with ids.",30747466

Although they are mostly well tolerated, several authors have been emphasizing that the statins' safety profile is not totally clarified especially when considering risk of cancer in patients with long-term exposure to statins. This meta-analysis was aimed at evaluating the risk of cancer in patients with prolonged exposure to statins. Medline, cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched in order to identify studies with a minimum average follow-up of 10 years of exposure to statins and a cancer-related outcome reported. Relative risk (rr) of the primary outcomes and the combined effect was presented using a random-effects model. In the selected randomized control trials (rct), statin exposure was compared with placebo, and in the selected observational studies, it was compared with no exposure to statins.

In many countries, nsaids have been widely used among patients with ari or common cold for pain and fever relief. However, studies evaluating whether nsaids use during ari episodes may further increase the risk of stroke were very limited. During 2007 to 2011, 29åÊ518 patients with an incident hospitalization of stroke were identified. The date of admission was defined as the index date. Using case-crossover design, we compared the following exposure status between the case period (1- to 7-d period before the index date) and matched control period (366- to 372-d period before the index date): nsaids use during ari episodes, ari episodes without nsaids use, nsaids use only, or no exposure. Multivariable conditional regression models were used to estimate odds ratios adjusting potential confounders.

We applied functional data analysis, a statistical framework developed for analysing curve data, to investigate weekly temporal patterns in wastewater measurements of three prescription drugs with known abuse potential: methadone, oxazepam and methylphenidate, comparing them to positive and negative control drugs. Sewage samples were collected in february 2014 from a wastewater treatment plant in oslo, norway. The weekly pattern of each drug was extracted by fitting of generalized additive models, using trigonometric functions to model the cyclic behaviour. From the weekly component, the main temporal features were then extracted using functional principal component analysis. Results are presented through the functional principal components (fpcs) and corresponding fpc scores. Clinically, the most important weekly feature of the wastewater-based epidemiology data was the second fpc, representing the difference between average midweek level and a peak during the weekend, representing possible recreational use of a drug in the weekend. Estimated scores on this fpc indicated recreational use of methylphenidate, with a high weekend peak, but not for methadone and oxazepam. The functional principal component analysis uncovered clinically important temporal features of the weekly patterns of the use of prescription drugs detected from wastewater analysis. This may be used as a post-marketing surveillance method to monitor prescription drugs with abuse potential. Copyright å© 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27862608

This study aimed to compare receipt of screening mammography and the incidence of screen-detected breast cancer between metformin and sulfonylurea initiators. We used 2006-2014 us medicare claims to identify initiators of metformin or sulfonylurea aged 65+ years continuously enrolled in parts a/b for ‰ä´2 years pre-initiation and ‰ä´2 years post-initiation. We reported frequencies of screening mammograms and screen-detected breast cancer in 1 year pre-initiation among all cohort members and in 1 year post-initiation among cancer-free cohort members. Weighted screening risk differences (rds) were estimated comparing metformin to sulfonylurea group. We identified 41,436 and 13,367 initiators of metformin and sulfonylurea, 35% and 24% of which had ‰ä´1 screening mammogram in 1 year pre-initiation (weighted rd: 6 percentage points; 95% ci: 5 to 7), respectively. The weighted rd for screen-detected breast cancer associated with metformin was 0.00 percentage points (95% ci: -0.09 to 0.09). Among cancer-free cohort members, metformin initiators had 5 percentage points (95% ci: 4 to 6) and 0.11 percentage points (95% ci: -0.02 to 0.23) absolute risk excess of screening mammography and screen-detected breast cancer in 1 year post-initiation, compared with sulfonylurea initiators, respectively. Metformin initiators were more likely to receive screening mammograms than sulfonylurea initiators pre- and post-initiation, indicating possible detection bias due to differential screening mammography. Researchers should be aware of the potential for more screening mammograms pre- and post-initiation when interpreting the findings of metformin on breast cancer incidence.

The aim of this report is to explore the clinical probability of a higher risk in males to support the use of statistical methods to identify subgroups at risk for adverse drug reactions. Disproportionality analysis was performed for all drug-adverse event (ae) pairs in the entire database and for the subsets of males and females. Ac-aseptic meningitis was highlighted for an increased disproportionality in the male subgroup in the absence of an elevated disproportionality measure for the database overall. A clinical review was undertaken. Clinical review revealed a similar statistical pattern of gender difference observed for amoxicillin, evidence to suggest a delayed type 4 hypersensitivity reaction with th1 cells as a mechanism for amoxicillin-aseptic meningitis, the existence of sex differences in immune responses (th1/th2), and an analogous increased risk of drug-induced liver injury by ac in males. Subgroup disproportionality analysis has revealed a larger than expected number of reports of aseptic meningitis after amoxicillin and ac in males.

Similar to earlier years, in 2016 50.9% of all high-risk use opioid users received all their opioid prescriptions from a single prescriber, and 71.1% used a single pharmacy to fill them. Despite clinically significant declines in high-risk opioid use, in 2016 nearly 1 in 10 adult retail pharmacy users remained at high-risk for opioid overdose in the us. Future clinical and policy interventions should consider targeting older adults with medicare part-d, including those using a single pharmacy to fill their opioid prescriptions.",34435406

We assessed whether statin use decreases the incidence of adverse influenza-related outcomes. Additionally, we used a new-user study design to minimize healthy user bias. We further examined the possibility of non-causal associations by using unrelated outcomes. We used the uk clinical practice research datalink to identify all patients aged 30 or older diagnosed with influenza-like illness during 1997-2010. Statin users were compared with propensity score-matched patients not receiving statins. The outcome was hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia or death in the 30‰Ûädays following influenza diagnosis. Logistic regression estimated cumulative incidence ratios. The study cohort included 5181 statin users matched to 5181 non-users. The 30-day incidence of hospitalization or death was 3.5% in statin users and 5.2% in non-users, resulting in a 27% lower incidence with statin use (cumulative incidence ratio: 0.73, 95%ci: 0.59-0.89). New statin users were less protected against our composite outcome. The effect of statins was less pronounced among those with respiratory and cardiac disease. Statin use was shown to be associated with a non-statistically significant risk reduction of motor vehicle accident and burns. The attenuation of the effect of statins with the new-user design, supporting evidence from the assessment of effect modification, and additional sub-analyses evaluating the effect of statins on non-related outcomes suggest that the beneficial effect of statins on influenza-related adverse outcomes may be explained by a healthy user bias.

Our objective was to assess the association between sglt2-i initiation and gout using a cohort study design and a symmetry analysis. Using the danish nationwide health registries, we conducted an active comparator, new user cohort study comparing the 3-year risk of gout among sglt2-i users with propensity score matched glp1-ra users. Individuals were followed according to the intention-to-treat, and incidence rate differences (ird) and hazard ratios (hr) were obtained. To address unmeasured confounding that is stable over time, a corresponding symmetry analysis was performed. 11 047 pairs of sglt2-i and glp1-ra users were identified, contributing 42 201 person-years of follow-up. The incidence rate of gout was 4.1 and 7.0 events per 1000 person years among sglt2-i and glp1-ra users, yielding an ird of -3.0 (95% confidence interval: -4.4 to -1.5) and hr of 0.58 (0.44 to 0.75). In the symmetry analysis, 80 individuals initiated sglt2-is prior to gout; 118 patients initiated treatment after gout. The trend adjusted sr was 0.63 (0.47 to 0.84) and the active comparator adjusted estimate was 0.67 (0.44 to 0.86). Initiation of sglt2-is was associated with a markedly decreased risk of gout compared to initiation of glp1-ras. The findings are comparable to prior studies addressing this association.",33881179

Nontraditional data sources may contain relevant safety information; early evaluation of these data will help to determine the product safety profile. Advanced technologies have allowed the development of digital tools to screen these data, which in some situations are classified as software as a medical devices and subject to clinical evaluation and post-marketing surveillance. Artificial intelligence may help to reduce or even eliminate noise from within these data, allowing safety experts to focus on the most pertinent evidence. We propose a data typology and provide considerations on how to define adverse events within different types of data, even where no human reporter exists.

This was a repeated cross-sectional study using monthly national pharmacy claims data, to examine trend changes in the prevalence of valproate use among wcbp pre and post two separate regulatory events in december 2014 and april 2018. Annual population estimates from the central statistics office were used to calculate the prevalence rate per 1000 eligible women. Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series with negative binomial regression was used to examine rates for wcbp aged 16-44‰Ûäyears, and by 10-year age groups. Prevalence ratios (pr) are presented with 95% confidence intervals (cis).

While clinical trials did not confirm a causal role, case reports suggested a possible link of varenicline with neuropsychiatric adverse drug events (npaes). This study aims to investigate the risk of npaes associated with varenicline initiation among the general population in a real-world setting. We conducted a sequence symmetry analysis (ssa) based on the university of groningen iadb.nl prescription database. We selected incident users of both varenicline and marker drugs for npaes, including depression, anxiety and sleep disorder within different time-intervals. Adjusted sequence ratios (asr) were calculated for each time-interval. Within 365-days' time-interval 1066 patients were incident users of both varenicline and npae marker drugs. In total, 505 patients were prescribed varenicline before npae marker drugs and 561 vice versa (crude sequence ratio [csr] 0.90, 95% ci: 0.80-1.02). After adjustments for trends in prescriptions, overall a null association was found (asr 1.00, 95% ci: 0.89-1.13). Regarding specific npaes, no increased risks were found for depression nor anxiety within any time-interval. A small transient increased risk was found for sleep disorders, particularly in earlier time-intervals 3 and 6åÊmonths (asrs 1.52, 95% ci: 1.10-2.11 and 1.45, 95% ci: 1.15-1.83, respectively). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. Varenicline initiation was unlikely to be associated with an increased risk of taking anti-depressants nor anti-anxiety drugs. Yet a small, but statistically significant, transient association with drugs for sleep disorders was noticed, possibly associated with withdrawal symptoms caused by smoking cessation.",34464494

Our main objective was to examine recording delays in the clinical practice research datalink (cprd) for outcomes of interest for vaccine safety to inform the feasibility of nrtvss using these data. We also evaluated completeness of recording and further assessed reporting delays for hospitalized events in cprd. We selected guillain-barrÌ© syndrome (gbs), bell's palsy (bp), optic neuritis (on) and febrile seizures (fs), from january 2005 to june 2014. We assessed recording delays (e.g. Due to feedback from specialist referral) in stand-alone cprd by comparing the event and system dates and excluding delays >1åÊyear. We used linked cprd-hospitalization data to further evaluate delays and completeness of recording in cprd. Among 51åÊ220 patients for the stand-alone cprd analysis (gbs: nåÊ=åÊ830; bp: nåÊ=åÊ12åÊ602; on: nåÊ=åÊ1720; and fs: nåÊ=åÊ36åÊ236), most had a record entered within 1åÊmonth of the event date (gbs: 73.6%; bp: 93.4%; on: 76.2%; and fs: 85.6%).

Of these, <50% had a record in cprd after 1åÊyear (gbs: 41.3%; bp: 22.1%; on: 22.4%; and fs: 41.8%). This work shows that most diagnoses in cprd for the conditions examined were recorded with delays of ‰ä_30åÊdays, making nrtvss possible. The pattern of delays was condition-specific and could be used to adjust for delays in the nrtvss analysis.

An increased tuberculosis incidence was not observed in the former use group compared with the nonuse group (aor 1.05, 95% ci 0.95-1.17). In this case-control study, we found that recent ppi use and continuous ppi use were associated with increased tuberculosis development.

However, it is unclear how best to apply hd-ps principles outside their original setting, given important differences between claims data and electronic health records (ehrs). We aimed to implement the hd-ps in the setting of united kingdom (uk) ehrs. We studied the interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (ppis). Whilst previous observational studies suggested an interaction (with reduced effect of clopidogrel), case-only, genetic and randomised trial approaches showed no interaction, strongly suggesting the original observational findings were subject to confounding. We derived a cohort of clopidogrel users from the uk clinical practice research datalink linked with the myocardial ischaemia national audit project. Analyses estimated the hazard ratio (hr) for myocardial infarction (mi) comparing ppi users with non-users using a cox model adjusting for confounders. To reflect unique characteristics of uk ehrs, we varied the application of hd-ps principles including the level of grouping within coding systems and adapting the assessment of code recurrence. Results were compared with traditional analyses. Twenty-four thousand four hundred and seventy-one patients took clopidogrel, of whom 9111 were prescribed a ppi. Traditional ps approaches obtained a hr for the association between ppi use and mi of 1.17 (95% ci: 1.00-1.35). Applying hd-ps modifications resulted in estimates closer to the expected null (hr 1.00; 95% ci: 0.78-1.28).

We identified outpatient visits (2007-2012) with recently documented (‰ä_180åÊdays) cardiovascular risk and classified patients according to whether the exposure (statin) was initiated within 14åÊdays. We selected each beneficiary's first eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during the respective look-backs: continuous enrollment (1 or 3åÊyears for fixed look-back; 180åÊdays for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. We estimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (hrs) for the effect of statin initiation on incident 6-month cancer (a known null effect) and 2-year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using each look-back. Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated hr from the all-available approach (hråÊ=åÊ0.90, 95% ci: 0.83, 0.98) was less biased than the 1-year look-back (hråÊ=åÊ0.79, 95% ci: 0.73, 0.84), which included beneficiaries with prevalent cancer. The 3-year look-back (hråÊ=åÊ1.05, 95% ci: 0.90, 1.21) was somewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due the exclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuous enrollment (62.0% and 59.9% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). All approaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality. Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding. The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the 3-year fixed, which produced the least biased point estimate. If 3-year look-backs are infeasible (eg, due to power/sample), all-available look-backs may be preferable to short (1-year) fixed look-backs.",29655187

By raising the minimum number of cases for each drug-laboratory abnormality pair from 2 to 400, the ppv and sensitivity increased to 53.9% and 67.2%, respectively. This post hoc variation, named cert400, performed particularly well for drug-induced hepatic and renal toxicities.

We show that in a model that includes terms for both ever-exposure versus never-exposure and cumulative exposure, the parameter for ever-exposure represents the effect of time-invariant allocation bias, and the parameter for cumulative exposure represents the effect of the drug after adjustment for this unmeasured confounding. This assumes no stepwise effect of the drug on the event rate, no reverse causation, and no unmeasured time-varying confounders. We demonstrated this by modelling the effect of statins on cardiovascular disease, for which the true effect has been well characterised in randomised trials, using time-updated cox regression models in a national cohort of type 2 diabetes patients. The crude hazard ratio associated with ever-use of statins was 1.13 in a standard cohort analysis comparing exposed with unexposed person-time intervals. When ever-never use and cumulative exposure are modelled jointly, the effect of statins can be estimated from the cumulative exposure parameter (hazard ratio 0.97 per year of exposure, 95% ci 0.97 to 0.98). The ever-exposed term (hazard ratio 1.20, 1.16 to 1.23) in this model can be interpreted as estimating the allocation bias. Where stepwise effects on the risk of adverse events are unlikely, as for instance for effects on risk of cancer, joint modelling of ever-never and cumulative exposure can be used to study the effects of multiple drugs and to distinguish causal effects from confounding by allocation.",29024286

We identified every dispensation of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for patients with af initiating oral anticoagulants between 2010 and 2015. For each dispensation, we extracted date and duration. Refill gaps were calculated as difference between expected and observed dates of successive dispensation. Refill gaps were summarized using descriptive statistics. To account for repeated observations nested within patients and to assess the components of variance of refill gaps, we used unconditional multilevel linear models. We identified 61åÊ516 new users. Majority were prescribed warfarin (60.3%), followed by rivaroxaban (16.4%), dabigatran (14.5%), apixaban (8.8%). Most frequent recorded duration of dispensation was 7åÊdays, suggesting use of pharmacist-prepared weekly pillboxes.

The variance of refill gaps was greater among warfarin users than among doac users. Greater refill gaps for warfarin may reflect inadequate capture of the period covered by the number of dispensed pills recorded in administrative data.

While no different from other forms of confounding in theory, confounding by indication often requires specific methods to address the bias it creates in addition to common epidemiological adjustment or restriction methods. Clinical indication influencing treatment prescription is patient-specific and complex, making it challenging to measure within nonexperimental research. Restriction of the study population to patients with the indication for treatment would effectively mitigate confounding by indication and bring about comparability between exposure and comparator populations with respect to probability of the exposure. Active comparators are often an effective practical solution to restrict the study population in this manner when indication cannot be measured accurately. This article discusses various forms of confounding by indication, the utility of active comparators for nonexperimental studies of treatment effects, and the active comparator, new user (acnu) study design to implicitly condition on indication. Considerations for selecting active comparators and conducting an acnu study design are discussed to enable increased adoption of these methods, improve quality of nonexperimental studies, and ultimately strengthen our evidence base for intended and unintended treatment effects in relevant target populations.",35019190

A total of 3084 women aged 10-25åÊyears were enrolled in this post-marketing surveillance from 2008 to 2014. Subjects were invited to receive three doses of the vaccine (0, 1 and 6åÊmonths), and participants who received at least one dose were included in the analysis. Adverse events (aes), adverse drug reactions (adrs) and serious aes (saes) were recorded after each dose. All aes, adrs and saes were presented with exact 95% confidence intervals (ci) (nct01101542). Injection-site pain was the most frequent ae and adr reported by 322 subjects (10.4% [95%ci: 9.4-11.6]); the local pain was transient and lasted 4-7åÊdays in most cases. Dysmenorrhoea and vaginitis were the most common unexpected aes reported by 30 (1.0% [95%ci: 0.7-1.4]) and 16 subjects (0.7% [95%ci: 0.3-0.8]), respectively. Pain (toe pain, leg pain and body pain [one case each]; foot pain [two cases]) was the most common unexpected adr reported by five subjects (0.2% [95%ci: 0.1-0.4]). Four subjects reported a single sae (one case each of exostosis, gastroenteritis, abortion and tonsillitis); none were fatal. All saes were assessed as unlikely to be related to vaccination; gastroenteritis, exostosis and tonsillitis resolved during the study period. This is the first post-marketing surveillance study in korea that provides 6-year safety data for hpv-16/18 as04-adjuvanted vaccine.

This leads to cyp2d6-mediated drug-drug interactions (ddi). Because systematic evaluations are lacking, we assessed the burden of metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine interaction in the elderly and how these interactions are managed in dutch community pharmacies. Dispensing data were collected from the university of groningen pharmacy database (iadb.nl, 1999-2014) for elderly patients (‰ä´60åÊyears) starting beta-blockers and/or antidepressants. Based on the two main ddi alert systems (g-standard and pharmabase), incidences were divided between signalled (metoprolol-fluoxetine/paroxetine) and not-signalled (metoprolol-alternative antidepressants and alternative beta-blockers-paroxetine/fluoxetine) combinations. Incident users were defined as patients starting at least one signalled or a non-signalled combination. G-standard signalled throughout the study period, whereas pharmabase stopped after 2005. A total of 1763 patients had 2039 metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine co-prescriptions, despite ddi alert systems, and about 57.3% were signalled. The number of metoprolol-alternative antidepressant combinations (incidencesåÊ=åÊ3150) was higher than alternative beta-blocker-paroxetine/fluoxetine combinations (incidencesåÊ=åÊ1872). Metoprolol users are more likely to be co-medicated with an alternative antidepressant (incidencesåÊ=åÊ2320) than paroxetine/fluoxetine users (incidencesåÊ=åÊ1232) are. The number of paroxetine/fluoxetine users co-prescribed with alternative beta-blockers was comparable to those co-medicated with metoprolol (about 50%). Less than 5% of patients received a substitute therapy after using metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine. Most of the metoprolol users (90%) received a low dose (mean dddåÊ=åÊ0.47) regardless whether they were prescribed paroxetine/fluoxetine. Despite the signalling software, metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine combinations are still observed in the elderly population. The clinical impact of these interactions needs further investigation.

This study evaluated the use of bhms in the routine signal detection analyses of potential first-trimester teratogens, where these models have not previously been applied. Data on 15 058 malformed foetuses exposed to first trimester medications (1995-2011) from 13 european congenital anomaly (ca) registries were analysed. The proportion of each ca in women taking a specific medication was compared with the proportion of that ca in all other women in the dataset (55 cas ÌÑ 523 medications). Bhms were grouped by either medications or cas or by both simultaneously, and the results compared with analysing each medication-ca combination separately and adjusting for multiplicity using a double false discovery rate (fdr) procedure. The proportions of ""high-risk"" medications (medications which have been shown to carry a moderate to high risk of foetal malformations) identified as potential signals were compared, as well as the total number of potential signals requiring follow up (the effective workload). Bhms identified more high-risk medications than the double fdr method, but the effective workload was larger. A bhm grouping both medications and cas, for example, identified 23% of high-risk medications compared with 14% by the double fdr; however, there was an increase from 16 to 71 potential signals requiring follow up. For comparable effective workloads, bhms did not outperform the double fdr, which is comparatively straightforward to implement and is therefore recommended for continued use in teratogenic signal detection analyses.",31908100

We denote this the ""bottleneck count"" (bnc). We describe how to translate the bnc into an achievable precision and provide empirical examples. First, we derive a theoretical prediction of the precision in a study where only the bnc determines precision. As an illustration, we calculated the expected precision of a null-effect study on retinoids and peptic ulcer bleeding, expressed as the upper/lower confidence limit ratio (ulclr). Finally, we reviewed 126 effect estimates from the literature, analyzing the relationship between the predicted and achieved precision. The log-log transformed ulclr was shown to be a simple linear function of log(bnc). The expected annual number of retinoid-users experiencing a peptic ulcer bleeding was 9.8, yielding an estimated ulclr for a 1-year study of 3.84. The literature review showed an inverse linear relationship between the logarithmic bnc and the log-log transformed ulclr, which was largely independent of study design, effect measure and category of bnc. Achieved precision deviated little from predictions but was usually lower than predicted, particularly with low bnc. The precision of a study can be predicted simply and with good accuracy from the bnc, which is useful for determining whether a study is worth pursuing or not.",33480043

Regulatory authorities have shared responsibility with mahs sponsoring postmarketing nonintervention studies in determining study goals and design.

By updating an earlier systematic review, we summarize modern statistical best practices for evaluating and correcting for potential bias due to unmeasured confounding in estimating causal treatment effect from non-interventional studies. We suggest a hierarchical structure for assessing unmeasured confounding. First, for initial sensitivity analyses, we strongly recommend applying a recently developed method, the e-value, that is straightforward to apply and does not require prior knowledge or assumptions about the unmeasured confounder(s). When some such knowledge is available, the e-value could be supplemented by the rule-out or array method at this step. If these initial analyses suggest results may not be robust to unmeasured confounding, subsequent analyses could be conducted using more specialized statistical methods, which we categorize based on whether they require access to external data on the suspected unmeasured confounder(s), internal data, or no data. Other factors for choosing the subsequent sensitivity analysis methods are also introduced and discussed, including the types of unmeasured confounders and whether the subsequent sensitivity analysis is intended to provide a corrected causal treatment effect. Various analytical methods have been proposed to address unmeasured confounding, but little research has discussed a structured approach to select appropriate methods in practice. In providing practical suggestions for choosing appropriate initial and, potentially, more specialized subsequent sensitivity analyses, we hope to facilitate the widespread reporting of such sensitivity analyses in non-interventional studies. The suggested approach also has the potential to inform pre-specification of sensitivity analyses before executing the analysis, and therefore increase the transparency and limit selective study reporting.",32929830

Possible outcomes were adjudicated against outcome specific case definitions and a date of onset assigned by using electronic and other medical records. Observed (risk period) to expected (outside risk and preexposure periods) rate ratios, postexposure incidence, and plots of time from exposure to outcome were reported. Sixteen of 1011 events from 4578 exposures fulfilled a primary case definition and had a date of onset during the study period. Three were in observed time.

Of 1‰Ûä140‰Ûä602 patients, the distribution of index prescriptions was 44% fluoroquinolones (non-first-line), 28% trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx) (first-line), 24% nitrofurantoin (first-line), 3% narrow-spectrum ë_-lactams (non-first-line), 1% broad-spectrum ë_-lactams (non-first-line), and 1% amoxicillin/ampicillin (non-recommended). Compared to the risk of pyelonephritis for nitrofurantoin (0.3%), risks were higher for tmp/smx (rd, 0.2%; 95% ci, 0.2%-0.2%) and broad-spectrum ë_-lactams (rd, 0.2%; 95% ci, 0.1%-0.4%). Compared to the risk of prescription switch for nitrofurantoin (12.7%), the risk was higher for tmp/smx (rd 1.6%; 95% ci 1.3%-1.7%) but similar for broad-spectrum ë_-lactams (rd -0.7%; 95% ci -1.4%-0.1%) and narrow-spectrum ë_-lactams (rd -0.3%; 95% ci -0.8%-0.2%). Subgroup analyses suggest tmp/smx treatment failure may be due in part to increasing uropathogen resistance over time. The risk of treatment failure differed by antibiotic agent, with higher risk associated with tmp/smx versus nitrofurantoin, and lower or similar risk associated with broad- versus narrow-spectrum ë_-lactams. Given serious safety warnings for fluoroquinolones, these results suggest that nitrofurantoin may be preferable as the first-line agent for outpatient treatment of uncomplicated uti.",33783918

However, potentially important information, including duration, recurrence, and intensity of events, is lost. In this study, we illustrate how the additional information can be obtained and incorporated into analyses of aes. Data on psychiatric aes were extracted from clinical study reports (csrs) provided by the manufacturer of oseltamivir in 4 prophylaxis randomised trials in adults and adolescents. We analysed the incidence, recurrence, duration, and intensity of events, using logistic regression models where the outcome compared was proportion of days suffering from an event, and developed novel presentation techniques. Psychiatric aes were generally more frequent, longer, and more intense in the treatment than placebo arms. Logistic regression models confirm the apparent association overall (odds ratio [or] 3.46, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.28 to 9.32), particularly for events classified as severe (or 34.5, 95% ci 3.66 to 325). However, the absolute difference in proportion of days suffering from severe psychiatric aes between groups was small. This example analysis shows evidence of a causal effect of oseltamivir on psychiatric aes, not apparent in the published versions of the same trials and a cochrane review which showed a nonsignificant 81% increased odds of experiencing a psychiatric event.

The reverse wtd is the distribution of time from the last dispensed prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of it. It is a mirrored version of the ordinary wtd, which considers the first dispensed prescription of patients within a time window. Based on renewal process theory, the reverse wtd can be analyzed as an ordinary wtd with maximum likelihood estimation. Based on danish prescription data for nsaids, warfarin, bendroflumethiazide and levothyroxine in the years 2013 and 2014, we compared estimates from the reverse wtd to those of the ordinary wtd regarding prevalence, stopping fractions and the 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distributions. The fraction of all users in 2013 stopping treatment varied from 73.1% (nsaid) to 9.3% (levothyroxine). Comparing prevalence estimates of the reverse wtd at the end of 2013 with those of the ordinary wtd at the start of 2014, relative differences did not exceed 4.8%. For the estimated 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distribution, differences did not exceed 3.3%. The reverse wtd allows estimation of the aggregated fraction of users stopping treatment and prevalence, especially when the wtd reliably separates current users from users who have stopped treatment. It may replace ad-hoc decision rules for automated implementations, and it yields estimates of real-time prevalence. Copyright å© 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28474439

Two algorithms were assessed for icd-10-cm: validated icd-10 codes in the literature and codes translated from icd-9-cm using an established mapping algorithm. We used segmented regression analysis on time-series data to examine changes in the 3-month prevalence (both level and trend) before and after the icd-10-cm implementation. Significant changes in the level were found in 19 and 11 conditions when using the icd-10 codes from the literature and mapping algorithm, respectively. The conditions with inconsistent levels by both of the algorithms were valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, mild liver disease, moderate to severe liver disease, metastatic cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and collagen vascular diseases, coagulopathy, blood loss anemia, deficiency anemia, alcohol abuse, and psychosis.

Common designs have included pregnancy registries and case-control studies. Recently, pregnancy cohorts nested within healthcare utilization databases are increasingly being used. Despite clear advantages, these databases share some important limitations that may threaten the validity of studies emerging from them. This paper describes the distinctive methodological aspects of conducting drug safety studies in healthcare utilization databases with special emphasis on design and analytic approaches to minimize biases. We describe considerations for study design, cohort definition, and follow-up. We then address issues related to exposure ascertainment based on prescription fills, including the importance of the etiologically relevant window and of properly accounting for preterm births. This is followed by a discussion of advantages and challenges when ascertaining maternal and infant outcomes based on secondary data. We then explore useful approaches to address confounding within the context of pregnancy research and of the potential for selection bias when restricting the cohort to live births. Finally, we consider issues related to external validity and statistical significance. The examples are mainly drawn from a pregnancy cohort nested in the medicaid analytic extract. The approaches presented provide guidance regarding the important methodological considerations that need to be attended to in order to generate valid, minimally biased risk when using large healthcare utilization databases for drug safety surveillance in pregnancy.",31074570

We searched diversion case reports of all other nonscheduled psychoactive prescription drugs in the researched abuse, diversion, and addiction-related surveillance (radars) system. Case report data are drawn from a quarterly survey of prescription drug diversion completed by a national sample of law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Rates of diversion per 100åÊ000 population were calculated for each year from 2002 to 2017 for prescription medications with greater than 400 reported cases during the period. Cyclobenzaprine, quetiapine, and trazodone met criteria for analysis. We found a significant and steady increase in the diversion of each drug over the period. The 2017 annual rates of diversion per 100åÊ000 population for the three medications range from 0.0428 to 0.0726. Although these rates of diversion are much lower than the rate for total opioid analgesics, they are all more than five times higher in 2017 compared with 2002. While diversion rates for opioids have decreased in recent years, rates for cyclobenzaprine, quetiapine, and trazodone have continued to increase. A common attribute of the three nonscheduled drugs studied here is that all are used for the treatment and/or self-treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and the increasing diversion of these drugs may be related to the ongoing opioid epidemic and to increasing levels of control over pharmaceutical opioid availability in the united states.

As a case study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia (hcap). Ppi use has been associated with increased hcap risk, but this association likely results from confounding by indication due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). Using the uk's clinical practice research datalink, we compared the risk of hcap within 180åÊdays between ppi users and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (h2ra) users in an acnu cohort using cox proportional hazard models with a time-fixed exposure definition adjusted for high-dimensional propensity score deciles. We then performed the same analysis on an ""extremely-restricted"" cohort of incident nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) users, some of whom received ppis for prophylaxis. Because ppis were given as prophylaxis in this population, confounding due to gerd should be limited. We compared effect estimates between acnu and restricted cohorts to evaluate confounding in both analyses. In the acnu cohort, ppis were associated with an increased risk of hcap (hazard ratio [hr]: 1.25; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.05, 1.47), but this association was not present in the restricted cohort (hr: 1.06; 95% ci: 0.75, 1.49).

This method uses the amount of drug redeemed, when available, and researcher-defined temporal gaps to fill the interval between the calculated end of coverage of a redeemed prescription and the date of redemption of the next prescription in the same treatment episode. The final scope is defining periods of continuous use of medications. There are strong pharmacological and epidemiological arguments for adding the gap at the end of each treatment episode. However, the evidence is scarce on the impact that such a practice has on measures of association. This study aims to compare the impact of adding or not adding the researcher-defined gap time to the end of a treatment episode on the incidence of drug discontinuation and the incidence rate for a simulated outcome that occurred during an observational window. Additionally, the study aims at assessing the magnitude of misclassification of exposure time between the two methods. A simulated dataset of 100 patients available in the r package adherer that contains 1080 redeemed prescriptions was used. A gap time of 90‰Ûädays was used for constructing treatment episodes in an observational window of 365‰Ûädays following the first redeemed prescription. Two approaches were used for defining treatment episodes that were named ""gap+"" and ""gap-"" and that respectively add and did not add the gap time at the end of a treatment episode. An outcome was simulated by using an exponential baseline hazard function with scale parameter ëÈåÊ=åÊ0.5 and censoring at time tåÊ=åÊ365‰Ûädays. The incidence rate ratio for the simulated outcome between the two approaches was computed. The 100 patients were followed for a median time of 183‰Ûädays (interquartile range, iqr 50-365‰Ûädays) and a median time of 273‰Ûädays (iqr 140-365‰Ûädays), respectively using ""gap-"" and ""gap+"". During the first 100‰Ûädays of the follow-up period, none of the patients was found to discontinue the treatment with the method ""gap+"" while 38 patients discontinued using the method ""gap-"". The approach ""gap+"" exerted a higher incidence rate for the simulated outcome among the exposed (0.98 events/person-years) when compared to the ""gap-"" (0.82 events/person-years) during defined periods of continuous treatment use. When comparing the two approaches and using the method ""gap-"" as the reference group, the incidence rate ratio for the simulated outcome was 1.20 (95% confidence interval: ci 0.72-2.02) among the exposed. This study showed that not adding the gap at the end of the treatment episodes leads to an overestimation of drug discontinuation, particularly at the beginning of the observational window, and an underestimation of the incidence rate of a hypothetical outcome during the period of exposure to the medication.",34611960

Between january 2010 and june 2015, prevalence of codeine prescribing was obtained every 6 months, and a time series analysis (joinpoint) was performed. Codeine prescribing within å±30 days of ta was also identified. Furthermore, doses, durations, and prior prescribing of other analgesics were investigated. Over the 5-year period, codeine prescribing decreased in children younger than 12 years (by 84% in france and spain, 44% in gp practices in germany, and 33% in the united kingdom). The temporal pattern was compatible with the regulatory intervention in france and the united kingdom, whereas a decrease throughout the study period was seen in germany and spain. Decreased prescribing associated with ta was suggested in ent practices in germany. Codeine prescribing for children decreased in line with introduced regulatory measures.

We propose the term pharmacologically pertinent period of effect (pppe) to address this time window. We explored the pppe in light of the rofecoxib saga. We identified the observational database studies of rofecoxib at doses 25 and 50åÊmg daily and thromboembolic events. We also obtained the kaplan-meier curves of vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research trial (vigor) and adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx (approve) trials. We found seven observational studies with nine analyses. All the studies only looked at current exposure. At the dose of 25åÊmg, only three of nine analyses were barely statistically significant. At the dose of 50åÊmg, the risk ratios were much higher. The visual inspection of the kaplan-meier curves shows that in the approve trial (25åÊmg), the placebo and rofecoxib curves start separating to become statistically significantly different only after 36åÊmonths. In contrast the vigor (50åÊmg), curves start separating very early and the divergence increases after 8åÊmonths. The 50åÊmg observational studies, looking at current exposure, correctively identified the almost immediate increase in risk evident in the vigor kaplan-meier curves. The absence of an immediate increase in risk shown by the approve trial was also correctively identified by most observational 25åÊmg studies. To our knowledge no observational study was done on the long-term cardiac toxicity of the 25-mg dose. It would thus appear that the two doses of rofecoxib have different pppes.",30628139

This article shares key lessons from early evaluation phases, including identifying stakeholders and their evaluation needs, choosing evaluation theories and approaches, and developing evaluation questions, designs, and methods appropriate for the cnodes context. Stakeholder analysis was conducted using documentary analysis to determine key contextual factors and research evidence needs of decision maker partners and other stakeholders. Selected theories and frameworks from the evaluation and knowledge translation literature informed decisions about evaluation design and implementation. A developmental approach to evaluation was deemed appropriate due to the innovative, complex, and ever-changing context. A theory of change, logic model, and potential evaluation questions were developed, informed by the stakeholder analysis. Early indicators of program impact (citation metrics, alternative metrics) have been documented; efforts to collect data on additional indicators are ongoing. A flexible, iterative, and emergent evaluation approach allows the knowledge translation team to apply lessons learned from completed projects to ongoing research projects, adapt its approaches based on stakeholder needs, document successes, and be accountable to funders/stakeholders.

Our objective was to characterize opioid use patterns among scd patients using a large nationwide database. A large, us medical claims database was utilized to identify a cohort of 3882 scd patients, and characteristics of opioid use were analyzed. Clinical variables including age, gender, medication use, health care utilization, and medical history were evaluated for correlations with opioid use. Forty percent of patients took opioid medications during a 12-month span, and the prevalence of any opioid use was highest for 20 to 29-year-old patients (58%). The median daily opioid dose was 1.85åÊmg (interquartile range: 0.62-10.68åÊmg) oral morphine equivalents (ome). While most opioid users took between 0 and 5åÊmg ome daily, 3% of pediatric patients and 23% of adult patients used more than 30-mg ome daily. High-dose opioid use was associated with older age, hydroxyurea therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) use, and frequent inpatient hospitalizations.

Prescriptions rates were calculated for all prescriptions by class and described over time. Across provinces, we identified 650 830 patients who initiated antidiabetic medications during the study period. In most provinces, the overall prescription rate of antidiabetic medications increased during the last two decades. Metformin particularly increased in popularity, surpassing sulfonylureas in all provinces as the most widely prescribed antidiabetic medication by the early 2000s. Thiazolidinediones grew in popularity from the onset of their availability until 2006 to 2007, at which point they rapidly declined. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors saw substantial growth in several provinces following their addition to provincial formularies in 2008 to 2012, while glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists experienced modest growth.

We conducted a cohort study among 1747 hiv/hcv patients initiating nrti-containing art within the veterans aging cohort study (2002-2009) to determine if cumulative mtnrti use increased the risk of hepatic decompensation and death among hiv-/hcv-coinfected patients. Separate marginal structural models were used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) of each outcome associated with cumulative exposure to art regimens that contain mtnrtis versus regimens that contain other nrtis.

The study focuses on the use of simvastatin and atorvastatin before and after their patent expiry and rosuvastatin, to investigate the impact of the reduced acquisition costs on prescribing. Interrupted time series analysis of primary care use data from the health and social care information centre database from 1998 to 2015. Primary care expenditure on statins increased by 125% during the period 1998 to 2004 driven by branded simvastatin and atorvastatin. Before 2003, the rate of use of more potent branded atorvastatin exceeds branded simvastatin. Between 2004 and 2011, the less potent but less expensive agent generic simvastatin has the higher utilisation rate (66%). Since 2012, the more potent agent but less expensive generic atorvastatin has the higher utilisation rate (50%). The more potent branded rosuvastatin failed to make a significant impact on the english statins market. The availability of generic statins has reduced overall expenditure significantly. When there is a significant price difference, acquisition cost appears to be the main influencing factor in prescribing statins, but, when costs are similar, potency is a key factor. This suggests that english prescribers are cost sensitive and appear to be prepared to trade marginal benefit for savings.",28612964

Using the aware (access, watch and reserve) list and the who priority pathogens list, we established a list of antimicrobials and carried out a vigibase search via vigiaccess, looking for adr reports with preferred terms (pts) that contained amr-relevant information. Identified terms were matched with codes from the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra version 21.1). Records on 86 drugs were retrieved with a total of 1‰Ûä170‰Ûä751 adr reports submitted between 1968 and 2018. Seventeen pts suggesting suspected resistance, ineffectiveness, inappropriate use, or medication error were used to code 15‰Ûä250 reports.

Only 6/20 (30%) ei-aed/doac interactions were listed in all eight databases, and even in these six cases, severity rankings were universally discordant. Extreme inconsistencies in interaction reporting (some compendia assigning the highest possible severity ranking, while others reported no interactions) were observed in half of the individually examined interactions (10/20). Drug compendia are highly inconsistent in the inclusion and reported severity of interactions between ei-aeds and doacs. Generation of high-quality, real-world evidence from large-scale outcome studies is imperative to resolve discordance and provide clarity for clinical guidelines.",31517414

Claims-based data delineated pregnancy exposures and outcomes of live or nonlive births among women with cia and pso (etn exposed, unexposed) and general population (gp) comparators. Infant outcomes were determined for live-born infants covered by the mother's insurer. Medical records were obtained from all accessible mother-infant pairs with claims for mcms and a random sample of mothers. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the odds ratios (ors) of having at least one algorithm-defined mcm in the etn-exposed cohorts versus unexposed comparators. Prevalence estimates for pregnancy outcomes were comparable across cia and pso cohorts. Algorithm-defined prevalence estimates of having at least one mcm were 6.1% (etn exposed), 5.5% (unexposed), and 5.7% (gp cohort) for the cia cohort; pso cohort estimates were 2.0%, 4.2%, and 4.7%, respectively. The etn-exposure ors for having at least one algorithm-defined mcm among infants of cia mothers was 1.03 (95%ci: 0.51-2.10) and 0.39 (95%ci: 0.05-2.98) among infants of pso mothers. Logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting that included disease state resulted in an or of 0.65 (0.24, 1.72). Overall, this study did not identify any new safety concerns associated with the use of etanercept during pregnancy. Etanercept, along with the other tnfis, remains a treatment without well-controlled clinical trials in pregnant women.

This study aimed to determine whether the use of tramadol is associated with the occurrence of seizures. We conducted a case-case-time-control (cctc) study by identifying patients who had received tramadol and seizure diagnosis in a nationwide healthcare database in south korea between 2003 and 2015. Each case was matched for age and sex to one future case to adjust for time trends in exposure without selection bias from the use of an external control group. The use of tramadol was assessed during a risk period of 1-30‰Ûädays, and two reference periods, 61-90‰Ûädays and 91-120‰Ûädays, preceding the first diagnosis of seizures. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (aor) by dividing the or in cases (case-crossover) by the or in future cases (control-crossover). We performed a dose-response analysis using the average daily dose. We identified 2523 incident cases with matched future cases (mean age, 45.4‰Ûäyears; 50% men). The aor for seizure with tramadol use was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.98-1.43) in the cctc analysis, with a case-crossover or of 1.19 (0.98-1.43) and control-crossover or of 1.27 (1.03-1.56).

Because of the opioid antagonism of naltrexone, ldn users are probably often warned against concomitant use with opioids. In this study, based on data from the norwegian prescription database, we examine changes in opioid consumption after starting ldn therapy. We included all norwegian patients (nåÊ=åÊ3775) with at least one recorded ldn prescription in 2013 and at least one dispensed opioid prescription during the 365åÊdays preceding the first ldn prescription. We allocated the patients into three subgroups depending on the number of collected ldn prescriptions and recorded the number of defined daily doses (ddds) on collected prescriptions on opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics and antipyretics from the same patients. Among the patients collecting ‰ä´4 ldn prescriptions, annual average opioid consumption was reduced by 41 ddds per person (46%) compared with that of the previous year. The reduction was 12 ddds per person (15%) among users collecting two to three prescriptions and no change among those collecting only one ldn prescription. We observed no increase in the number of ddds in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other analgesics and antipyretics corresponding to the decrease in opioid use. Possibly, ldn users avoided opioids because of warnings on concomitant use or the patients continuing on ldn were less opioid dependent than those terminating ldn. Therapeutic effects of ldn contributing to lower opioid consumption cannot be ruled out. å© 2017 the authors. Pharmacoepidemiology & drug safety published by john wiley & sons ltd.",28370746

Many latin american countries continue to lag behind europe and the united states in establishing regulatory guidance and effective pharmacovigilance systems for biosimilars. Results from our survey also highlight a lack of awareness regarding the availability of biosimilars, their nomenclature, automatic substitution, and reporting adverse drug reactions because of these drugs. The main barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in latin america are the lack of consensus on the interchangeability of reference biologics and biosimilars, and the need for more suitably trained personnel to carry out effective postmarketing pharmacovigilance of biosimilars.

In japan, approximately 88.8% of patients with ntm suffer from mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (mac) lung disease. Incidence of mac lung disease is increasing in particularly among the middle-aged and elderly women owing to a rapid increase in nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. General treatment for mac lung disease is chemotherapy. The type of chemotherapy recommended by specialists to prevent the development of a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria consists of a combination of clarithromycin (cam), rifampicin, and ethambutol (eb). Cam monotherapy is contraindicated by specialists owing to its high potential to induce drug-resistant bacterial strains in patients with mac lung disease. In addition, administering eb at doses not less than 1000‰Ûämg‰Ûäd  is not recommended to avoid adverse drug reactions. However, it is unclear how much such treatment cases exist in real world clinical settings. This is because no long-term investigation has been carried out. This study investigated treatment with these drugs from 2005 to 2017, by studying 1135 patients with mac lung disease based on health insurance claims database. Results showed that approximately 9.2% (101 cases) were prescribed long-term cam monotherapy for 3 months or longer and approximately 3.6% (18 cases) were prescribed high doses of eb. Cam monotherapy over a long period of time is potentially detrimental to some patients.

We sought to synthesize the medical literature for observational studies examining the association between opioid analgesic dose and the risk of serious adverse health outcomes, with particular attention to the outcomes of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death. Searching medline using pubmed and bibliography review, we identified 22 observational studies published between 2000 and 2015 that assessed the association between opioid analgesic dose and the risk of serious adverse health outcomes. Some of these studies had significant methodological limitations. Twelve reviewed studies examined the outcomes of misuse, overdose, or death; no studies examining the risk of addiction or abuse met our criteria for inclusion. The results of multiple studies clearly indicate an increasing risk of serious adverse health outcomes associated with increasing opioid analgesic dose. In particular, the risk of misuse, overdose, and death increases with increasing opioid analgesic dose. However, there is no opioid dose inflection point beyond which the risk of these adverse health outcomes increases. No opioid analgesic dose is without risk. The reviewed studies show an increasing risk of serious adverse health outcomes-including misuse, overdose, and death-associated with increasing opioid analgesic dose. Further research is needed to characterize the relationship between opioid analgesic dose and the risk of addiction and abuse.

Individual opioid-related poisoning codes (e.g., 965.xx and x42), and adverse effects of opioids codes (e.g., e935.xx) combined with diagnoses possibly indicative of overdoses (e.g., respiratory depression), were evaluated by comparison with chart audits. Opioid adverse effects codes had low ppv to detect overdoses (13.4%) as assessed in 127 charts and were not pursued. Instead, opioid poisoning codes were assessed in 2100 individuals who had those codes present in electronic health records in the period between the years 2008 and 2012. Of these, 10/2100 had no available information and 241/2100 were excluded potentially as anesthesia-related. Among the 1849 remaining individuals with opioid poisoning codes, 1495 events were accurately identified as opioid overdoses; 69 were miscodes or misidentified, and 285 were opioid adverse effects, not overdoses. Thus, ppv was 81%. Opioid adverse effects or overdoses were accurately identified in 1780 of 1849 events (96.3%). Opioid poisoning codes have a predictive value of 81% to identify opioid overdoses, suggesting icd opioid poisoning codes can be used to monitor overdose rates and evaluate interventions to reduce overdose.

Among patients initiating oac in 2013 in the french healthcare databases, those treated for orthopaedic indications were excluded. Patients with a history of af or dvt/pe directly identified from available medical data, mainly hospital discharge diagnoses, were considered to be 'confirmed af or dvt/pe patients'. Demographics of these patients and their healthcare utilization data prior to oac initiation were then included in a logistic regression model discriminating af versus dvt/pe indications.

Dmt use declined during pregnancy but increased again after delivery. Glatiramer acetate and interferon beta were most commonly dispensed. Pregnancies with and without early dmt exposure had similar risks of outcomes to one another and to pregnancies in women without ms. Small numbers did not allow evaluation of specific dmts. Approximately one third of commercially insured women with ms in the united states uses dmts before conception. Neither ms itself nor early pregnancy use of dmts overall seems to be associated with a substantial risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",30834654

We categorized rwe studies with respect to study type, for example, case series, studies based on medical records, and so on. We compared the frequency that plans cited different categories of rwe, cited rwe for different diseases, and cited rwe for drugs on the market for different time periods. Rwe comprised 16% of cited clinical studies. Health plans cited rwe with different frequencies (5%-31% of the cited clinical evidence). Overall, plans cited rwe categorized as medical records most often (26% of cited rwe studies). Plans varied in the frequency they cited different rwe categories. Plans most frequently cited rwe for gastroenterological diseases (35% of clinical study citations) and least frequently for respiratory diseases (11% of clinical study citations).

This study evaluates the full cohort of signals disseminated from the dutch srs in the period from 2008 to 2017. Each retrieved signal was characterised on a number of aspects. The signal management process from signal generation to a potential pi update was analysed in four steps: (1) signal characterisation; (2) proposed actions by the dutch national competent authority (nca) for the signals; (3) presence of pi update (yes/no) and association with signal characteristics; (4) timing from the moment the signal was issued to pi update. For step 1-3 we stratified products in caps and naps. Of all signals, 88.7% led to a proposed regulatory action by the nca. Signals from the dutch srs for caps versus naps more often concerned biologicals, important medical events, class effects and shorter periods since marketing authorization. We detected pi updates for 26.2% of cap signals and 61.3% of nap signals. The dutch srss remains an important source of signals.

We determined use of cardiovascular medications in the 90‰Ûädays pre- and post-stroke and calculated mortality rates. There were 3201 hospitalised is cases: 76.2% non-af stroke, 15.7% af pre-stroke, and 8.1% af post-stroke.

Administration of second-generation antipsychotics has resulted in diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic coma leading to death. Therefore, pharmacists are required to collect information on clinical test values, determine the appropriate test timing, and coordinate with doctors for further clinical laboratory orders, all of which are labor-intensive and time-intensive tasks. In this study, we developed a side effect-monitoring tool and aimed to clarify the influence and efficiency of monitoring side effects by using the tool in patients taking atypical antipsychotics in whom it is necessary to check clinical test values such as blood sugar levels. We extracted clinical test values for patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics from electronic medical records. The test values are automatically displayed in the side effect grade classification specified by ctcae ver. 4.0. A database was constructed using scripts to provide alerts for the timing of clinical testing. The pharmacist used this tool to confirm clinical test values for patients taking medication and requested the physician to inspect orders based on the appropriate test timings. The management tool reduced the pharmacists' effort in collecting information on patients' prescription status and test values. It enabled patients to undergo tests at the appropriate time according to the progression of glucose metabolism and allowed for easy monitoring of side effects. The results suggested that regardless of pharmacists' experience or skill, the introduction of this tool enables centralization of side effect monitoring and can contribute to proper drug use.",30221424

In 37 cases, evidence from animals was the reason given for withdrawal between 1963 and 2000. Evidence of carcinogenicity was cited in 23 cases (62%). Limited evidence for harms occasioned withdrawal in over 80% of cases. In 11 cases (30%), the adverse drug reactions were subsequently reported in humans. In 5 instances (14%), formal studies were conducted in humans. The median interval to withdrawal following reports of adverse reactions was 2åÊyears (iqråÊ=åÊ1-9åÊy).

We used united kingdom's clinical practice research datalink to identify the cohort of all women aged 50 to 79 during 1987-2008, with all incident cases of vte occurring during the study period identified. Using a nested case-control approach, the rate ratios (rrs) of vte with current use of oral estrogen and oral estrogen-progestogen combinations were estimated as a function of duration of use using conditional logistic regression with cubic splines. The cohort of 955åÊ582 postmenopausal women included 23åÊ505 cases of vte matched to 231åÊ562 controls. The risk of vte was increased with current use of oral estrogen (rr 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.37 to 1.63) and oral estrogen-progestogen (rr 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.44 to 1.65), relative to non-use. When assessed by duration of use, the risks with oral formulations were particularly elevated during the first year of use and were reduced subsequently. The phenomenon of depletion of susceptibles should be considered in cohort studies evaluating acute side effects of medications.

Pubmed was searched for etiological studies published between 2015 and 2019 in 15 high-ranked journals from cardiology, diabetes, and epidemiology. We selected studies that analyzed blood pressure, glucose, or lipid measurements (whether exposure, outcome or confounder) by linear or logistic regression. Two reviewers independently recorded how medication use was handled and assessed whether the methods used were in accordance with the research aim. We reported the methods used per variable category (exposure, outcome, confounder). A total of 127 articles were included. Most studies did not perform any method to account for medication use (exposure 58%, outcome 53%, and confounder 45%). Restriction (exposure 22%, outcome 23%, and confounders 10%), or adjusting for medication use using a binary indicator were also used frequently (exposure: 18%, outcome: 19%, confounder: 45%). No advanced methods were applied. In 60% of studies, the methods' validity could not be judged due to ambiguous reporting of the research aim. Invalid approaches were used in 28% of the studies, mostly when the affected variable was the outcome (36%). Many studies ambiguously stated the research aim and used invalid methods to handle medication use. Researchers should consider a valid methodological approach based on their research question.",35384126

We identified patients in the study whose admissions were coded as adrs using icd-10-am codes. We then compared the prevalence and characteristics of adr-related hospital admissions identified by the two approaches. According to icd-10-am coding, 2.7% of patients were admitted due to adrs, while 15.0% of patients were deemed to have been admitted due to adrs based on prospective identification by clinical pharmacists. Most (85.7%) patients coded as having an adr-related hospital admission were also identified as such prospectively. Hematological (23.1%) and metabolic reactions (23.1%) were frequent causes of adrs identified by coding, whereas cardiovascular adrs (27.8%) were more common causes of adrs identified prospectively by pharmacists. Antidepressants (16.7%) and cardiac glycosides (16.7%) were the most commonly implicated drug groups in adrs identified by coding, whereas diuretics (28.8%) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (17.0%) were frequently implicated as causes of adrs identified prospectively by pharmacists. Reliance on administrative coding potentially underestimates the extent of the problem of adrs as a cause of hospitalization in the elderly, and more detailed prospective analysis of admissions provides additional targets for strategies to prevent adrs.

The safety profile of these medications is not firmly established, and concerns have been raised about their potential carcinogenicity. The objective of our study was to produce new evidence on the effect of incretin-based medications on cancer risk in patients with dm2. We conducted a ""retrospective cohort"" study with data from the clinical practice research datalink and the hospital episodes statistics in the uk. New users of either an incretin-based medication (nåÊ=åÊ18åÊ885) or a sulfonylurea medication (nåÊ=åÊ36åÊ929) between 2007 and 2013 were identified and followed for up to 8åÊyears. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the quasi-intention-to-treat and quasi-per-protocol hazard-ratios for the association between incretin-based medications with cancer while adjusting for potential confounders. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for use of incretin-based medications versus use of sulfonylurea medications for the overall-cancer outcome was 0.97 (0.90, 1.05) in the quasi-intention-to-treat analysis and 0.90 (0.81, 1.00) in the quasi-per-protocol analysis. In both analyses, the hazard-ratio functions over the 8-year follow-up seemed fairly constant, and the 8-year cumulative-risk functions in the two subcohorts were similar. Our study suggests that the use of incretin-based medications in patients with dm2 does not increase the risk of cancer relative to the use of sulfonylurea medications, at least in the first several years of the use. Further research is needed to assess long-term effects of the use of incretin-based medications on cancer risk.",30779266

In-hospital, patient-level prescribing linked to indication is needed to support surveillance, evaluation of stewardship initiatives, as well as other antibiotic research. We evaluated whether a novel dataset linking hospital pharmacy records to hospital episode statistics data can be used for antibiotic research. Using the hospital treatment insights (hti) database, which links hospital episode statistics to pharmacy records from 43 out of 153 hospital trusts in england, we estimated the proportion of missed linkage and identified characteristics associated with missing data. Linkage of antibiotics to patients was inconsistent and dependent on drug type and clinical setting, so that linkage for some specific antibiotics was high (80-100%), but overall, only 27.6% (ci: 27.4%-27.8%) for all antibiotics dispensed. Linkage was best for quinolones (62.6%; ci: 61.8%-63.8%), but only 21.1% (ci: 21.1%-21.2%) for penicillins. Linkage was lower for common antibiotics and in emergency departments; however, 80% linkage was achieved for individual drugs like clindamycin, especially on wards with reduced ward stock use. For those antibiotics with high linkage, hti might be used to study associations between indication, dispensing, and outcomes. However, the majority of common antibiotics had insufficient linkage, likely due to extensive use of ward stocks. Therefore, hti in its current form is not suitable for general antibiotic surveillance or evaluation of stewardship initiatives. For drugs in hti other than antibiotics, linkage should be similarly evaluated before a study is conducted.",29230891

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 770åÊ095 medicare part d prescribers after linking the 2013 national open payments data with 2013 medicare provider utilization and payment data. The exposure variable was the categorized amount of total industry payments to prescribers (i.e., meals, travel, research, and ownership). The outcome was prescriber's annual generic drug prescribing rate. Multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to examine the association between the amount of industry payments and prescriber's annual generic drug prescribing rates, controlling for prescriber's demographic and practice characteristics. In this sample, over one-third (38.0%) of medicare part d prescribers received industry payments in 2013. The mean annual generic drug prescribing rate was highest among prescribers receiving no payments and lowest among those receiving more than $500 of industry payments (77.5% vs. 71.3%, respectively; påÊ<åÊ0.001). The receipt of industry payments was independently associated with prescribers' generic drug prescribing rate; higher payments corresponded with lower generic drug prescribing rates. Other prescriber characteristics associated with higher annual generic drug prescribing rate included male sex, non-northeast region, specialty, and patient volume. Receipt of industry payments was associated with a decreased rate of generic drug prescribing. How this affects patient care and total medical costs warrants further study.

This study is based on a multinational, web-based study conducted in 15 european countries from october 2011 to february 2012. Information about maternal demographics, illnesses, and medication use during pregnancy was collected via an electronic questionnaire. Pregnant women and new mothers with a child less than 1-year-old could participate. The swedish, australian, and u.s. Risk classification systems were used to evaluate medication safety. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation models were used. A total of 587 medications were reported by the study sample (nåÊ=åÊ6657). Sixty-nine percent of the women used medications classified as safe, 28% used medications classified as risky, and 3% used medications with no classification available. Both socio-demographic and medical factors were associated with the use of risky medications during pregnancy. Having a chronic disorder was the factor with the strongest association with the use of risky medications during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratioåÊ=åÊ3.99, 95% confidence interval 3.54-4.49). The majority of women used medications classified as safe to use during pregnancy. However, a considerable proportion of women still used medications classified as risky.

This checklist expands on the reporting of studies conducted using observational routinely collected health data specific to pharmacoepidemiology (record-pe) guidelines. A key aspect of data linkage evaluation for pharmacoepidemiology is to articulate how a linkage process was performed and its accuracy in terms of validation and verification of the resulting linked data. This study generates a checklist, which covers domains including data sources, linkage variables, linkage methods, linkage results, and linkage evaluation. For each domain, specific recommendations provide a clear and transparent assessment of the linkage process. Linking data sources can help to enrich analytic databases to more accurately define study populations, enable adjustment for confounding, and improve the capture of health outcomes.

We estimated prevalence for selected defects by vsd site and birth year and compared these estimates to those in a us and european surveillance system. We developed algorithms to enumerate >50 major structural birth defects from standardized administrative and healthcare data based on utilization patterns and expert opinion, applying criteria for number, timing, and setting of diagnoses. Our birth cohort included 497‰Ûä894 infants across seven sites. The period prevalence for all selected major birth defects in the vsd from 2004 to 2013 was 1.7 per 100 live births. Cardiac defects were most common (65.4 per 10‰Ûä000 live births), with one-fourth classified as severe, requiring emergent intervention. For most major structural birth defects, prevalence estimates were stable over time and across sites and similar to those reported in other population-based surveillance systems.

Medicare administrative claims were used to measure statin medication adherence as a continuous value in the 6 months before an acute myocardial infarction (ami) hospitalization. Different gbtm specifications beyond default settings were constructed and compared with the bayesian information criterion. Spaghetti plots were used to compare individual adherence patterns with group averages. Overall, 113,296 prevalent statin users met eligibility criteria. Four adherence groups were identified: persistently adherent, moderately adherent, progressively nonadherent, and persistently nonadherent. Spaghetti plots showed the persistently adherent and persistently nonadherent groups had relatively homogeneous adherence patterns that matched predicted trajectories well. Spaghetti plots also showed that, while adherence patterns in the progressively nonadherent group were not as homogeneous, most patients in this group appeared to be discontinuing statin therapy pre-ami. Subjective decisions are necessary to identify a final trajectory model. Greater transparency and disclosure of these decisions in the medication adherence literature are needed.

Food and drug administration.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4386,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate contributions to postmarket safety assessments and identify potential factors for enhancing implementation and utilization of registries in regulatory decision-making. Registry documents (e.g., protocols, reports) submitted to the fda were identified up to january 2016 through an extensive, systematic review of internal records and resources. We characterized nonpregnancy drug exposure registries based on prespecified design elements, performance, and regulatory impact. A total of 65 registries were identified: 56 registries were open and 9 closed. Among open registries, 20% were pending, 14% delayed, and 16% ongoing less than ‰ä_3åÊyears. Most registries (82%) examined safety issues that originally arose from clinical trials; most frequent safety issues investigated included infections, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and liver toxicity. Although 74% of registries ascertained baseline health conditions and monitored concomitant medication use, fewer (45%) considered drug exposure duration or dosage. Thirty-seven percent of non pending registries had enrollment below sample size expectation. Seventeen registries published findings in journals/conference proceedings, 13 from open registries. Three closed registries generated results that contributed to product label changes. High-performance registries scored higher in design metrics related to sample size considerations (76% versus 62%) and adequate analysis plan (53% versus 35%), and interim report submission (76% versus 65%). There was a significant difference in proportion of registries with clear primary objectives between high versus not high performing registries (100% versus 78%). This study suggests clear objectives, patient accrual/retention efforts, adequate analysis plans, and interim reports contribute to the performance of drug exposure registries.",29349833

Japanese health insurance claims and medical check-up data from october 2015 to march 2017 were analyzed to assess factors associated with target sua achievement in gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis in gout. Target sua was further assessed by subgroup analysis of urate-lowering therapy (ult) prescriptions and outcomes, stratified by renal function. Patients achieving target sua tended toward older, female, higher ult dose, higher adherence, more comorbidities, and/or antidiabetic drugs prescribed. Renal dysfunction and/or diuretic prescriptions were associated with reduced achievement of target sua. Severe renal dysfunction was particularly influential (odds ratio [or] = 0.22 [95% confidence interval (ci): 0.10-0.48] for <15, 0.15 [0.10-0.23] for ‰ä´15 to <30, compared with egfr ‰ä´90‰Ûäml/min/1.73‰Ûäm  ). Across all renal function categories, mean prescribed ult dose was low (febuxostat 17.0-21.0 mg/day, allopurinol 123.1-139.6 mg/day), and target sua achievement was reduced among renal dysfunction patients. Gouty arthritis was more likely in patients with a prior history of such occurrences, and less likely for higher ult adherence, sua monitored regularly at medical facilities, and/or more comorbidities. In a real-world setting, severe renal dysfunction is the most important risk factor for failure to achieve the target sua, suggesting suboptimal disease management in patients with gout or hyperuricemia complicated by this condition. Findings associated with gouty arthritis suggest that these occurrences could be successfully managed by regular monitoring of sua and closer adherence to ult.",32939919

From the ims lifelink data (2001-2009), we identified dmpa and oral combined hormonal contraceptive (chc) users without a prescription claim 6åÊmonths before and after the first and last claim. Episodes were defined as all contiguous claims with no more than 90-day dmpa or 30-day chc between claims. Days' supply (chc) and 90-day duration (dmpa) was used to determine episodes. We used interrupted time series to evaluate changes in the mean episode length and proportion of episodes >2åÊyears before and after the food and drug administration's november 2004 boxed warning.

In the 10 therapeutic subgroups with the highest dispensed volumes across all countries/regions the relative changes between the covid-19 period and the year before were mostly of a magnitude similar to changes between previous periods. However, for drugs for obstructive airway diseases the changes in the covid-19 period were stronger in several countries/regions. In all countries/regions a decrease in dispensed ddds of antibiotics for systemic use (from -39.4% in romagna to -14.2% in scotland) and nasal preparations (from -34.4% in lithuania to -5.7% in sweden) was observed. We observed a stockpiling effect in the total market in march 2020 in six countries/regions. In czechia the observed increase was not significant and in slovenia volumes increased only after the end of the first lockdown. We found an increase in average therapeutic quantity per pack dispensed, which, however, exceeded 5% only in slovenia, germany, and czechia. The findings from this first european cross-national comparison show a substantial decrease in dispensed volumes of antibiotics for systemic use in all countries/regions.

This is the first study examining the prevalence and the risks of off-label antidepressant prescriptions in minors over time in germany and analyzing patterns regarding age, sex, drug class, and type of off-label use. We used claims data of about two million individuals (<18åÊy) to calculate the share of off-label antidepressant prescriptions for the years 2004 to 2011, stratified by age, sex, and drug class. Off-label prescriptions were analyzed regarding underlying diagnoses, the prescribing doctor's specialty, and the type of off-label use. Incidence rates of adverse events were calculated for off- and on-label use, and the risk of suicidal events associated with off- or on-label use was examined in a nested case-control study. The prevalence of off-label prescriptions decreased from 58.0% to 40.9%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were more frequently prescribed off-label than tricyclic antidepressants (37.7% vs 17.5% in 2011). The most common type of off-label use was off-label use by age, followed by off-label use by indication, and off-label use by contraindication. Adverse events were rare with no significant differences between on- and off-label use. Although off-label antidepressant use in minors decreased over time, it is still common. However, this rather indicates a lack of approved drugs for the treatment of depression in this population than inappropriate medical treatment. This is supported by the fact that off-label use was not associated with a higher risk of adverse events than on-label use.",28840629

We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the urban employee basic medical insurance database (2011-2014) in beijing. We identified 475 patients with newly diagnosed bone metastatic prostate cancer with at least one prescription for hormone therapy and described their treatment patterns over a median follow-up of 20.7 months. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare time to chemotherapy initiation between patients starting on different hormone therapies. Hormone therapy and/or bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid were the initial treatments in the majority of patients (87.8%); chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery were usually given later in the treatment pathway. Cab was the most common hormone treatment (73.7%). For time to chemotherapy initiation, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 2.43 (1.08-5.44) for nsaa alone vs cab and 1.29 (0.78-2.13) for castration alone vs cab. Our findings show that while a wide range of therapies are used to treat patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis in beijing, hormone therapy and bisphosphonate therapy are the most commonly prescribed, and use of cab was seen to be advantageous in delaying time to chemotherapy initiation over nsaa monotherapy.

We included 2017 cases (diagnosed 1999-2015) with pd and 7934 controls without pd. Diabetes medication use was identified from prescription register (1995-2015) and categorized to insulins, biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (tzds), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) analogues and glinide. Exposure for each medication class was determined as none, at least 3‰Ûäyears before outcome and only within the three-year lag time before pd outcome. The use of insulins, biguanides, sulfonylureas, dpp-4 inhibitors, glp-1 analogues or glinides was not associated with pd. Use of tzds before lag time compared to non-use of tzds (adjusted odds ratio (or) 0.78; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.64-0.95) was associated with decreased risk of pd. Our nationwide case-control study of people with diabetes found no robust evidence on the association between specific diabetes medication classes and risk of pd.

Simulations were conducted based on proposed or ongoing vaccine safety datalink studies. We simulated 4 studies of 2 exposure groups (children with no vaccines or on alternative schedules) and 2 baseline outcome levels (100 and 1000/100åÊ000 person-years), with 3 relative risk (rr) levels (rråÊ=åÊ0.50, 1.00, and 2.00), across 1000 replications using probabilistic modeling.

For 16,034 diabetic patients identified in cprd, with at least 2 measures in a 30-month period, hba1c was estimated after temporarily omitting (i) the final and (ii) middle known values using linear interpolation, simple linear regression, arithmetic mean, random effects, and fpca. Performance of each method was assessed using mean prediction error. The influence on predictive accuracy of (1) more homogeneous populations and (2) number and range of known hba1c values was explored. When estimating the last observation, the predictive accuracy of fpca was highest with over half of predicted values within 0.4åÊunits, equivalent to laboratory measurement error. Predictive accuracy improved when estimating the middle observation with almost 60% predicted values within 0.4åÊunits for fpca. These results were marginally better than that achieved by simpler approaches, such as last-occurrence-carried-forward linear interpolation. This pattern persisted with more homogeneous populations as well as when variability in hba1c measures coupled with frequency of data points were considered.

We illustrate reporting tools, graphical displays and sensitivity analyses to increase transparency and facilitate evaluation of the robustness of analyses involving hdps. Using a study from the uk clinical practice research datalink that implemented hdps we demonstrate the application of the proposed recommendations. We identify seven considerations surrounding the implementation of hdps, such as the identification of data dimensions, method for code prioritisation and number of variables selected. Graphical diagnostic tools include assessing the balance of key confounders before and after adjusting for empirically selected hdps covariates and the identification of potentially influential covariates. Sensitivity analyses include varying the number of covariates selected and assessing the impact of covariates behaving empirically as instrumental variables. In our example, results were robust to both the number of covariates selected and the inclusion of potentially influential covariates. Furthermore, our hdps models achieved good balance in key confounders.

We developed an extraction tool to assess how frequently new-user and prevalent-user designs were reported to be implemented. For studies that implemented a new-user design in both treatment arms, we extracted information about the extent to which the moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned. Of the 89 studies included, 40% reported implementing a new-user design for both the study exposure arm and the comparator arm, while 13% reported implementing a prevalent-user design in both arms. The moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned in both treatment arms in 53% of studies that reported implementing a new-user design. We provided examples of studies that minimized the risk of introducing bias due to unclear definition of time origin in unexposed participants, immortal time, or a time lag. Almost half of the included studies reported implementing a new-user design.

Following recruitment, demographic information and hard-copy prescription data for sampled records were abstracted on-site. Days' supply was independently calculated by two pharmacists using a standard formula with disagreements adjudicated blindly by a third pharmacist. Adjudicated days' supply was compared with that submitted to the pdmp and classified as accurate/inaccurate. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between accuracy and prescription/practice-related factors.

Factors associated with accuracy were presence of special instructions from the prescriber (or 3.13 [95% ci: 1.43, 6.82]), presence of 'as-needed' directions (or 0.29 [95% ci: 0.18, 0.47]), and billing to a third-party payer (or 1.43 [95% ci: 1.01, 2.02]). Accuracy of oa days' supply reported to the state pdmp was found to be moderately high. Certain prescription-related factors influence accuracy and should be accounted for in future studies. Patterns, including opioid 'split-billing' were identified and may impact validity of pdmp and administrative claims studies.",36053913

We determined whether ehr data could improve accuracy of icd-9 codes to define copd when compared with spirometry in plwh vs uninfected, and quantified level of discrimination using the area under the receiver-operating curve (auc). The development cohort consisted of 350 participants who completed research spirometry in the examinations of hiv associated lung emphysema (exhale) study, a pulmonary substudy of the veterans aging cohort study. Results were externally validated in 294 plwh who performed spirometry for clinical indications from the university of washington (uw) site of the centers for aids research network of integrated clinical systems cohort. Icd-9 codes performed similarly by hiv status, but alone were poor at discriminating cases from non-cases of copd when compared with spirometry (auc 0.633 in exhale; 0.651 in the uw cohort). However, algorithms that combined icd-9 codes with other clinical variables available in the ehr-age, smoking, and copd inhalers-improved discrimination and performed similarly in exhale (auc 0.771) and uw (auc 0.734).

We used data of 595 fd patients from an international database with information on drugs received and adverse effects. To investigate the molecular causes of reported differences in drug responses in fd patients, we used expression microarrays to compare the mrna expression profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes of fd patients (nåÊ=åÊ12) and healthy individuals (nåÊ=åÊ10). Several drug classes, including cholinergics, anti-cholinergics, anti-convulsants, methylxanthines, ssris, and antibiotics caused either unreported symptoms or elevated rates of adverse events in fd patients. Fd patients experienced different or more frequent adverse side effects than the general population in 31/123 drugs. These side effects included blood cell dyscrasias, amenorrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bronchospasm. New findings include enhanced reaction of fd patients to h2 antagonist agents and to serotonin receptor agonists.

The completeness and accuracy of pin were respectively calculated as the percentage of abc records coexisting (concordant) in pin and the percentage of concordant records having mutually agreeable information on drug quantity. Generalized linear models were used to examine potential association of pin completeness and accuracy with sociodemographic factors. A total of 1 218 191 drug prescription records from 13 143 atp participants were captured by pin and abc in 2008-2015, among which 91.6% were from pin, 82.5% from abc, and 74.2% coexisted in pin and abc.

This study aims to provide updated information on their use and costs. A cross-sectional yearly repeated study was conducted from 2006 to 2014 using the representative sample of the french national health care insurance system claims database (egb). Oacd use was described for each year, among prevalent (ie, patients with at least 1 oacd reimbursement) and incident users (ie, patients with no oacd reimbursement within the prior year) and according to their pharmacological classes (hormone therapy [ht], cytotoxic therapy [ct], targeted therapy [tt], and others). Demographic characteristics were described for both users; comorbidities and direct medical costs were described for incident users only. The yearly prevalence and incidence of oacd use, mainly represented by ht, remained stable from 2006 to 2014 (1.2%; 0.4%). Compared with users of other oacd classes, the proportion of tt users substantially increased over the 8-year study period (+9.3%), and tt incident users had more severe comorbidities at treatment initiation. The health expenditures were the most important in tt users with median monthly medical direct costs varying from 2995‰âÂ to 4968‰âÂ per patient between 2006 and 2014.

A nested case-control study was performed among patients aged ‰ä´18‰Ûäyears who had received hemodialysis for ‰ä´90‰Ûädays, had medicare parts a, b, and d coverage for ‰ä´1åÊyear, and had clinical evidence of shpt (parathyroid hormone >300‰Ûäpg/ml). Cases were those who experienced death or hospitalization caused by gastrointestinal bleeding. Each case was matched to up to four controls. Exposure was measured by any cinacalcet use, current use, past use, cumulative exposure days, and cumulative dosage. Conditional logistic models were used to assess the association. Of 48‰Ûä437 patients included, 2570 experienced gastrointestinal bleeding events (2498 non-fatal, 72 fatal), and 2465 (2397 non-fatal, 68 fatal) were matched to 9500 controls; 17.2% of cases and 15.8% of controls had cinacalcet exposure and 11.1% of both cases and controls had current use.

We conducted a simulation study examining the ability of the updating sequential probability ratio test (usprt) to detect substantially elevated gbs risk in the 8- to 21-day postvaccination versus 5ÌÑ to 30ÌÑ the historical rate. We varied the first testing week (weeks 5-8) and the null rate (1ÌÑ-3ÌÑ) and evaluated power. We estimated signal probability and the risk ratio (rr) after signaling when high-risk seasons were rare. Applying fixed alternatives, we found >80% power to detect a risk 30ÌÑ the historical rate in week 5 for the 1ÌÑ null and in week 6 for the 1.5ÌÑ to 3ÌÑ nulls. Nearly all testing schedules had >80% power for a 5ÌÑ risk by week 11. To test the robustness of usprt, we further simulated seasons where 1% were true high-risk seasons. Using a 1ÌÑ null led to 10% of seasons signaling by week 11 (median rr approximately 1.4), which decreased to approximately 1% with the ‰ä´2.5ÌÑ null (median rr approximately 16.0). On the basis of the results from this simulation and subsequent consultations with experts and stakeholders, we specified usprt to test continuously from weeks 7 to 11 using the null hypothesis that the observed gbs rate was 2.5ÌÑ the historical rate.

Only 1.5% of reports were classed as moderate/severe harm. Issues with availability, stock, and supply were found to be the most common causes. This usually entailed a lack of stock to fulfil a patient's dose/supply. Such incidents could potentially be reduced by improved management of the supply process, and liaison between pharmacy and clinical staff. The implementation of emergency drug cupboards at the discretion of an on-call pharmacist may prove to be a preventative measure for such errors.

Logistic regression, elastic net logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting models were trained and tuned on a training set. Random down-sampling of negative controls was applied on the training set to adjust for the imbalanced dataset. Final models were evaluated on the test set. Model performances were assessed using the area under the curve (auc) with 95% confidence interval of a receiver operating characteristic (roc), and specificity and precision were assessed at a threshold for perfect sensitivity (100%, to not miss any pstrs). Feature importance plots were inspected and a selection of features was used to re-train and test model performances with fewer features. 1439 (4.7%) of reports were pstr.

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the extent to which pharmaceutical claims from australia's national medicines subsidy programs (pharmaceutical benefits scheme [pbs] and repatriation schedule of pharmaceutical benefits [rpbs]) under-estimate prescription-only and total national opioid utilisation across time and for different opioids. A secondary aim was to examine the impact of the 2012 policy change to record all pbs/rpbs dispensed medicines, irrespective of government subsidy, on the degree of under-estimation. Aggregated data on australian opioid utilisation were obtained for the 2010 to 2014 calendar years, including all single ingredient and combination opioid analgesic preparations available on prescription or over-the-counter (otc). Total opioid utilisation (oral morphine equivalent kilogrammes) was quantified using sales data from ims health and compared with pharmaceutical claims data from the pbs/rpbs. Pbs/rpbs claims data did not account for 12.4% of prescription-only opioid utilisation in 2014 and 19.1% in 2010, and 18.4% to 25.4% of total opioid use when accounting for otc preparations. Between 2010 and 2014, 5.6% to 5.3% of buprenorphine, 8.1% to 6.3% fentanyl, 17.7% to 10.7% oxycodone, 18.4% to 11.0% tramadol, 38.4% to 21.0% hydromorphone, and 28.6% to 21.0% of prescription-only codeine utilisation were not accounted for in pbs/rpbs claims. Despite increased capture of less expensive (under co-payment) opioid items since 2012, pbs/rpbs claims still under-estimate opioid use in australia, with varying degrees across opioids. The estimates generated in this study allow us to better understand the degree of under-estimation and account for these in research using australia's national pharmaceutical claims data.",29047196

The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacists' attitudes to and knowledge on spontaneous adrs reporting in poland and to identify the reasons for underreporting of adrs. The study was conducted between january 2016 and january 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was designed and distributed to pharmacists.

It is not clear whether contemporary antiretrovirals contribute to the risk of esld. We included patients from cohorts with validated esld data in the north american aids cohort collaboration on research and design. Patients had to initiate antiretroviral therapy after 1 january 2004 with a nucleos(t)ide backbone of either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine and a contemporary third (anchor) drug. Patients were followed until a first esld event, death, end of a cohort's esld validation period, loss to follow-up or 31 december 2015. We estimated associations between cumulative exposure to each drug and esld using a hierarchical bayesian survival model with weakly informative prior distributions. Among 10‰Ûä564 patients included from 12 cohorts, 62 had an esld event. Of the nine anchor drugs, boosted protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir had the strongest signals for esld, with increasing hazard ratios (hr) and narrowing credible intervals (cri), from a prior hr of 1.5 (95% cri 0.32-7.1) per 5‰Ûäyear's exposure to posterior hrs respectively of 1.8 (95% cri 0.82-3.9) and 2.0 (95% cri 0.86-4.7). Both backbones and efavirenz showed no signal. Hepatitis c coinfection was the most important covariate risk factor (hr 4.4, 95% cri 2.6-7.0). While contemporary antiretrovirals pose less risk for esld than hepatitis coinfection, atazanavir and darunavir had a toxicity signal.

The search included studies published until march 2017. The frequencies of adverse events were extracted and are presented descriptively. Data from 23 randomized and 55 nonrandomized studies were included. Although inconsistent event reporting and high heterogeneity limited comparisons, the adverse event profile of inh/rpt-3 appeared generally favorable. Flu-like reactions were reported with an increased frequency and hepatotoxicity with a lower frequency than standard treatment. While inh/rpt-3 had an overall low frequency of adverse events compared to inh monotherapy, reporting of adverse events for many regimens was limited meaning results should be interpreted cautiously.

We examined and compared, over the same time frame, the outcomes of triptan exposure in pregnancy using (1) a retrospective claims database and (2) a previously completed pregnancy registry. Using the marketscan database, the risk of major birth defects was ascertained in live-born infants whose birth mothers were exposed to sumatriptan, naratriptan, or sumatriptan/naproxen during pregnancy. The frequencies of outcomes observed were compared with the findings of the 16-year sumatriptan, naratripan, and sumatriptan/naproxen prospective pregnancy registry. About 5120 pregnancies were identified in the retrospective claims cohort in contrast to 617 included in the prospective registry during the same time frame. The proportion of major birth defects among first-semester sumatriptan exposures was 4.0%, which is exactly the same as the proportion of major birth defects reported for first-semester sumatriptan exposures in the registry. There were very few non-livebirth outcomes in both the claims analyses and registry. These results confirm broad agreement between the database analysis and the registry regarding the safety of triptans during pregnancy. Of note, the number of triptan-exposed pregnancies identified in this large us database was about 7-fold that included in the prospective registry over the same time frame.

This algorithm was applied to adults with t2d in the healthcore integrated research database (hird) from 2016 to 2018. Clinical experts adjudicated anaphylaxis case status from redacted medical records. We used confirmed case status as an outcome for predictive models developed using lasso regression with 10-fold cross-validation to identify predictors and estimate the probability of confirmed anaphylaxis. Clinical adjudicators reviewed medical records with sufficient information from 272 adults identified by the anaphylaxis screening algorithm, which had an estimated positive predictive value (ppv) of 65% (95% confidence interval [ci]: 60%-71%).

Results from dutch ae studies showed that-despite various improvement initiatives-the incidence of preventable mraes did not decline. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of mraes during hospitalizations using national patient data from records of patients admitted to dutch hospitals in 2008 and 2011/2012. Trained nurses and physicians reviewed the randomly selected records of 8071 patients admitted to one of 20 hospitals in 2008 or 2011/2012 during a two-stage review process. Patient and admission characteristics were collected. After identification of a mrae, physicians determined their potential preventability, drug type, related prescribing factors, and potential consequences. The physicians identified 928 adverse events (aes) in 857 admissions, of which 218 (15.2%) were medication-related. They judged 55 (18.4%) of these as preventable. Preventability of mraes was high in anticoagulant treatment (42.5%). Haematoma (39.0%) and intra-cerebral haemorrhage (25.5%) were common types of anticoagulant-related aes. Anticoagulant-related aes were often related to dosage factors (46.9%) and often resulted in an intervention (80.2%), of which 40.2% was judged as preventable. This study provided detailed information on mraes during hospital admissions in the netherlands. A substantial proportion of aes was medication-related (15.2%), of which 18.4% was judged to be preventable. As preventability in mraes was especially high in anticoagulant treatment (42.5%), those medications are a threat to patient safety. Future research and new safety programs should focus on prevention of aes related to this medication group. Copyright å© 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27193415

A case/non-case approach was used to evaluate the association between several pregnancy-related adrs and clozapine exposure during pregnancy, using 2ÌÑ2 contingency tables to investigate disproportionality and standard meddra queries to select cases. Clozapine exposure was defined as all icsr-adr combinations with clozapine as (one of) the suspected drug(s).

The use of mm in austria increased from 2009 to 2012 on average by 0.025 percentage points per year (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.015-0.036). In december 2012, 1 in 123 women filled a prescription for any mm, equaling an average utilization of 0.84%. The relative risk of filling a prescription for a mm 6 months after filling a prescription for a tm was 2.70 (95% ci: 2.64-2.77). All investigated medication classes showed a higher risk for the prescription for mm. Medication from classes ""genitourinary system and sex hormones"" and ""systemic anti-infectives"" caused the highest increase in risk (109% and 89%, respectively). Prescriptions for class ""cardiovascular system"" caused the lowest increase in the risk (15%). Certain prescription medications are a significant risk factor for the need to take anticholinergic medication as a consequence.",31808271

We evaluated coding trends in health outcomes in the us food and drug administration's sentinel system during the transition. We reviewed all health outcomes coding trends reports on the sentinel website through november 30, 2019 and analyzed trends in incidence and prevalence across the icd-9-cm and icd-10-cm eras by visual inspection. We identified 78 unique health outcomes (22 acute, 32 chronic, and 24 acute or chronic) and 140 time-series graphs of incidence and prevalence. The reports also included code lists and code mapping methods used. Of the 140 graphs reviewed, 81 (57.9%) showed consistent trends across the icd-9-cm and icd-10-cm eras, while 51 (36.4%) and 8 (5.7%) graphs showed inconsistent and uncertain trends, respectively. Chronic hois and acute/chronic hois had higher proportions of consistent trends in prevalence definitions (83.9% and 78.3%, respectively) than acute hois (28.6%). For incidence, 55.6% of acute hois showed consistent trends, while 41.2% of chronic hois and 39.3% of acute/chronic hois showed consistency. Researchers using icd-10-cm algorithms obtained by standardized mappings from icd-9-cm algorithms should assess the mapping performance before use. The sentinel reports provide a valuable resource for researchers who need to develop and assess mapping strategies. The reports could benefit from additional information about the algorithm selection process and additional details on monthly incidence and prevalence rates. We reviewed health outcomes coding trends reports on the us fda sentinel website through november 30, 2019 and analyzed trends in incidence and prevalence across the international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (icd-9-cm) and icd-10-cm eras by code mapping method and the type of health outcomes of interest (acute, chronic, acute or chronic). More than a third of the 140 time-series graphs of incidence and prevalence of health outcomes showed inconsistent or uncertain trends. Consistency in trends varied by code mapping method, type of health outcomes of interest, and whether the measurement was incidence or prevalence. Studies using icd-9-cm-based algorithms mapped to icd-10-cm codes need to assess the performance of the mappings and conduct manual refinement of the algorithms as needed before using them.",33638243

The objective of this study was to examine the association between initial opioid prescription characteristics and risks of harm and long-term use. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study among ontario residents newly dispensed an opioid for pain between july 2013 and march 2016. The primary exposure was the average daily opioid dose dispensed at initiation (in milligram morphine equivalents; mme), with secondary exposures including the initial prescription's duration and formulation. The primary outcome was fatal or non-fatal opioid overdose. A secondary analysis studied continued opioid use for at least 1‰Ûäyear. Among the 2‰Ûä021‰Ûä371 individuals meeting our inclusion criteria, 1121 (0.56 per 1000 person-years) experienced an opioid overdose within 1‰Ûäyear and 64‰Ûä013 (3.17%) continued treatment for at least 1‰Ûäyear. Higher initial daily dose, longer prescription duration, and receipt of a long-acting formulation at initiation were significantly associated with higher hazard of overdose. Compared to daily doses of 20‰Ûämme or lower, initial doses exceeding 200‰Ûämme daily were associated with a particularly high hazard of overdose (ahr 2.97, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.62 to 5.44). In the secondary analysis, there were similar associations between initial dose, duration, and formulation and long-term use. Although the absolute risk of an opioid overdose within the first year of prescription opioid use is low, better alignment of opioid initiation practices with guidelines may reduce opioid-related harm.",33300138

The use of innovative or repurposed therapies to treat covid-19 patients is widespread; however, there are very limited data regarding the patterns of use and safety profile of most of these therapeutics in pregnant women. We assessed the patterns of use of covid-19 therapeutics during pregnancy using data from the international registry of coronavirus in pregnancy (ircep). The ircep is an international observational cohort study intended to assess the risk of major obstetric and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with covid-19. Women enrolled while pregnant or within 6åÊmonths after end of pregnancy. Follow-up for women enrolled while pregnant includes monthly online questionnaires throughout the pregnancy and, for live births, through the infant's first 90‰Ûädays of life. Participants provide information on demographic characteristics, health history, covid-19 tests and symptoms, medications, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. A total of 5780 women with covid-19 during pregnancy were identified from the ircep. Severity of covid-19 was classified in 372 of them as severe, 3053 moderate, and 2355 mild.

An algorithm based on a negative binomial time-series regression model run on 6 sequential observations prior to the monitored period was developed to forecast monthly counts of reports. A heuristic model to capture increases in counts when the previous 4 observations were null supplemented the regression. Count data were determined at drug-event combination. Sensitivity analyses were run to determine the effect of different methods of pooling or stratifying count data. Positive retrospective detections and positive predictive values (ppvs) were determined. The algorithm detected 8 of the 13 historical concerns, including all concerns of quality defects. The highest ppv (1.29%) resulted from increasing the lower count threshold from 3 to 5 and including literature reports in the counts. Both the regression model and the heuristic model components to the algorithm contributed to the detection of concerns. Sensitivity analysis indicates that stratification by commercial product reduces the ppv but suggests that pooling counts of related events may improve it. The results are encouraging and suggest that the algorithm could be useful for the detection of concerns that manifest as changes in frequency of reporting; however, further testing, including in prospective use, is warranted.",29143393

Our objective was to adapt the hdps algorithm to allow for the inclusion of multilevel treatments and compare estimates obtained via this approach with those obtained via pairwise comparisons in a case study using real-world data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cardiovascular events associated with three smoking cessation drugs (varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy [nrt]) using the clinical practice research datalink. We applied the binary hdps algorithm adjusted for pre-specified and empirically-selected covariates to cohorts formed by each treatment pair. We then constructed multinomial hdps models on a cohort of new users of any of the three drugs, adjusting for predefined covariates and different combinations of empirically-selected covariates. After trimming the area of non-overlap of the hdps distributions, the effects of the study drugs on cardiovascular events were estimated with the cox proportional hazards models adjusted for propensity score category. Outcome models adjusted for multinomial hdps estimated treatment effects that were slightly more protective than those estimated in pairwise comparisons (varenicline vs nrt: hr  = 0.60-0.62, hr  = 0.64; bupropion vs nrt: hr  = 0.70-0.72, hr  = 0.76). Trimming rates were similar between the two approaches. The extension of hdps to multilevel exposures is a valid and practical approach to confounder control that may be useful when comparing different classes of drugs prescribed for the same indication or different molecules within a given drug class.",31571347

Atrial fibrillation was the most common registered indication for edoxaban (67%) as well as the other doacs (41-55%). Overall, users of edoxaban were comparable to users of other doacs (median age 75 vs 72-76åÊyears and 57% vs 53-59% males), except for a generally lower concomitant use of other drugs. Noticeably, 95% of edoxaban users had previously received anticoagulant treatment compared with 31% to 43% for new users of other doacs, with 77% switching directly from another anticoagulant treatment to edoxaban (45% directly from vka and 32% directly from doacs). While the use of edoxaban is still limited compared with other doacs, it is increasing. The majority of edoxaban users switch to edoxaban from other anticoagulant treatments.

Such algorithms would have applications in pharmacoepidemiology, drug safety research, clinical trials, surveillance, and quality improvement. Our main objectives were to determine the positive predictive value for identifying type 1 diabetes in adults using a published algorithm (developed by klompas et al) and to compare it to a simple requirement that the majority of diabetes diagnosis codes be type 1. We applied the klompas algorithm and the diagnosis code criterion to a cohort of 66åÊ690 adult kaiser permanente colorado members with diabetes.

The klompas algorithm identified 3286 (4.9% of 66åÊ690) adults with diabetes as having type 1 diabetes. Based on chart reviews, the overall positive predictive value was 94.5%. The requirement that the majority of diabetes diagnosis codes be type 1 identified 3000 (4.5%) as having type 1 diabetes and had a positive predictive value of 96.4%.

We reviewed the electronic charts of all patients with a single icd-10 for hz (b02.xx) as their primary or secondary diagnosis in the emr of the children's hospital of philadelphia (chop) healthcare network from january 2010-march 2019. The positive predictive value (ppv) for a single code for hz was calculated and alternative algorithms were examined to determine which method resulted in the highest ppv.

It has been hypothesized that products or events reported frequently may ""mask"" signals. We analyzed the masking effect of vaccines in pediatrics in the eudravigilance database by conducting disproportionality analysis in the full database (containing vaccine exposures) and in a restricted set (excluding vaccine exposures). We measured performance of the reporting odds ratio (ror) in both data sets using a pediatric-specific drug reference set and in the absence of a reference set. We assessed masking effects across age groups and conducted a classification tree (cart) analysis. Removal of vaccines decreased the ror values both in negative and positive controls. Exceptions were drug-event combinations including outcomes frequent in vaccine reports. When restricted to positive control associations, removal of vaccine-related events resulted in increased ror values for events commonly reported following vaccination. For events rarely associated with vaccination, ror values decreased for all age groups, especially infants. Analysis in the absence of a reference set showed decrease in ror following vaccine removal and cart revealed that change in ror with vaccine removal depended upon age and proportion of reports including a vaccine. Removal of vaccines for signal detection in a pediatric population has an impact on ror, dependent upon the reporting frequency of the event of interest in combination with vaccines. We recommend stratification by age and removal of vaccine exposures if the investigated adverse drug reactions include those typically reported in association with vaccines for the age strata.",30066460

Recent examples include the approval of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy for male breast cancer and the inclusion of rwe in the label of paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia. This interest has created an urgency to develop processes that promote trust in the evidence-generation process. Key stakeholders and decision-makers include patients and their healthcare providers; learning health systems; health technology assessment bodies and payers; pharmacoepidemiologists and other clinical reseachers, and policy makers interested in bioethical and regulatory issues. A key to optimal uptake of rwe is transparency of the research process to enable decision-makers to evaluate the quality of the methods used and the applicability of the evidence that results from the rwe studies. Registration of rwe studies-particularly for hypothesis evaluating treatment effectiveness (hete) studies-has been proposed to improve transparency, trust, and research replicability. Although registration would not guarantee better rwe studies would be conducted, it would encourage the prospective disclosure of study plans, timing, and rationale for modifications. A joint task force of the international society for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research (ispor) and the international society for pharmacoepidemiology (ispe) recommended that investigators preregister their rwe studies and post their study protocols in a publicly available forum before starting studies to reduce publication bias and improve the transparency of research methods.

Survey questions related to database characteristics, covariate and health outcome variables, vaccine exposure characteristics, access and governance, and dataset linkage capability. Other questions collated research/regulatory applications of the data and local publications detailing database use for research.

However, the desired contrast often involves one new drug compared with an older drug, of which many users of the new drug may have switched from, seriously restricting the scope of incident new-user studies. We introduce prevalent new-user cohort designs for head-to-head comparative drug effect studies, where incident new users are scarce. We define time-based and prescription-based exposure sets to compute time-conditional propensity scores of initiating the newer drug and to identify matched subjects receiving the comparator drug. We illustrate this approach using data from the uk's clinical practice research datalink to evaluate whether the newer glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (glp-1 analogs) used to treat type 2 diabetes increase the risk of heart failure, in comparison with the older similarly indicated sulfonylureas. Of the 170‰Ûä031 users of antidiabetic agents from 2000 onwards, 79‰Ûä682 used sulfonylureas (first use 2000), while 6196 used glp-1 analogs (first use 2007), 75% of which had previously used a sulfonylurea. After matching each glp-1 analog user to a sulfonylurea user on the time-conditional propensity scores from prescription-based exposure sets, the hazard ratio of heart failure with glp-1 use was 0.73 (95%ci: 0.57-0.93). The proposed prevalent new-user cohort design for comparative drug effects studies allows the use of all or most patients exposed to the newer drug, thus permitting a more comprehensive assessment of a new drug's safety.

The analyses were validated using european influenza vaccine aes data from eudravigilance. Of the 80‰Ûä059 reports, 1185 (1.5%) were annotated as gbs related. Twenty-four aes were identified as having strong association with gbs.

Two hundred and one (0.25%) reports were predicted as of high risk of gbs (predicted probability >25%) and 84 actually developed gbs. The prediction performance demonstrated the potential of developing risk-prediction models utilizing the vaers cohort.

Retrospective cohort study using record linkage of routinely collected healthcare data (study period: february 2012 to february 2017). Overall survival (os) was analysed using kaplan-meier methods and cox proportional hazard models; a subgroup analysis comprised potentially trial-eligible patients. Overall, 271 patients were included and 73.8% died during the study period. Median os was poorer than in the pivotal trials, regardless of medication and indication: 10.8 months (95% confidence interval [ci] 8.6-15.1) and 20.9 months (95% ci 14.9-29.0) for abiraterone, and 12.6 months (95% ci 10.5-18.2) and 16.0 months (95% ci 9.8-not reached) for enzalutamide, post and pre chemotherapy, respectively. Only 46% of patients were potentially ""trial eligible"" and in this subgroup os improved. Factors influencing survival included baseline performance status, and baseline prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels. Poorer prognostic features of non-trial eligible patients impact real-world outcomes of cancer medicines. Electronic record linkage of routinely collected healthcare data offers an opportunity to report outcomes on cancer medicines at scale and describe population demographics.

We first used simulations to compare the performances of different ps-based methods, either alone or in combination with further mlr adjustment, in estimating att. Ps methods were, respectively, optimal pair (opm) and full (ofm) ps matching, subclassification on the ps (sbc), and the inverse probability of treatment weighting (iptw). We simulated several scenarios, according to different sample sizes, proportions of treated vs untreated subjects, and types of hrqol outcomes. We also applied the same methods to a real clinical data set. Opm and iptw provided the closest type i error to the nominal threshold ë±åÊ=åÊ0.05 across all scenarios. Overall, both methods showed also lower variability in estimates than sbc and ofm. Sbc performed worst, generally providing the highest levels of bias. Further mlr adjustment lessened bias for all methods, however providing higher type i error for sbc and ofm. In the real case, all methods provided similar att estimates except for one outcome. Our findings suggest that for sample sizes up to nåÊ=åÊ200, opm and iptw are to be preferred to ofm and sbc in estimating att on hrqol outcomes.

Medicaid claims were linked to prescription drug monitoring program records for a cohort of beneficiaries enrolled in the north carolina medicaid lip (nåÊ=åÊ2701). Using latent class growth analyses, we estimated trajectories of average daily mmes of opioids dispensed to beneficiaries across specific time periods of interest. Five trajectory patterns appeared to sufficiently describe underlying heterogeneity. Starting values and slopes varied across the 5 trajectory groups, which followed these overall patterns: (1) start at a high level of mmes, end at a high level of mmes (13.1% of cohort); (2) start medium, end medium (13.2%); (3) start medium, end low (21.5%); (4) start low, end medium (22.6%); and (5) start low, end low (29.6%).

Patients aged ‰ä´65‰Ûäyears who were initiated on statin therapy following the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke during one full year (1 january 2010 to 31 december 2010) constituted this cohort. Each patient was followed for a period of 3‰Ûäyears from the date of the first statin prescription. Patients with a continuous treatment gap of 6‰Ûämonths without statin prescription were designated as non-persistent. The cox proportional hazard model was applied to determine patient-associated characteristics that influenced the likelihood of non-persistence. During the 3-year follow-up period, 39.7% of patients in the study cohort became non-persistent. Factors associated with decreased probability of a patient becoming non-persistent were age ‰ä´75‰Ûäyears (hazard ratio (hr) 0.75), polypharmacy (concurrent use of ‰ä´6 drugs) (hr 0.79), diabetes mellitus (hr 0.80), dementia (hr 0.81) and hypercholesterolemia (hr 0.50).

It is hypothesized that bams with non-selective receptor binding may increase adrd risk more than m3-selective bams. This study compared adrd risk for users of non-selective and m3-selective bams and examines adrd risk associated with overall bam use. Retrospective cohort study of medicare claims for 71‰Ûä688 individuals who used bam drugs during 2007-2009 without an adrd diagnosis. We compared adrd incidence (2011-2016) between non-selective bam users (fesoterodine, flavoxate, oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium) and m3-selective bam users (darifenacin, solifenacin). Logistic regressions compared individuals using target drugs in the same category of total standardized daily doses (tsdd) as a standardized measure of drug exposure, and adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, healthcare utilization, other medication use, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. Secondary analyses compared adrd risk associated with different doses of bams overall. Non-selective bam use (compared to m3-selective) was not significantly associated with adrd incidence. Odds ratios for non-selective use were 0.97 (ci: 0.89-1.04) for 1-364 tsdd, 0.94 (ci: 0.83-1.06) for 365-729, 1.00 (ci: 0.87-1.16) for 730-1094, and 1.03 (ci: 0.88-1.20) for >1094. Higher tsdd of bams overall (combining both non-selective and m3-selective bams), when compared to 1-364 tsdd, were associated with increased adrd incidence (or = 1.05 (ci: 0.99-1.10) for 365-729, or = 1.11 (ci: 1.05-1.17) for 730-1094, and or = 1.10 (ci: 1.04-1.15) for >1094).

All women who were hospitalized in the maternity ward and had at least one pregnancy that ended with a delivery during the period of january 2014 and december 2015 were included in this study. The true delivery date was obtained from the electronic medical records and was used as a gold standard. The onset of pregnancy was calculated by subtracting the gestational age at birth from the delivery date based on the electronic medical records and was also used as a gold standard. The administrative data-based algorithms to identify (1) the onset of pregnancy estimated from the gestational age recorded as part of a diagnosis during a specific visit and (2) the delivery date estimated using the delivery-related diagnosis, procedure, or prescription were compared with the gold-standard data. Of the 1705 women included in this study, the onset of pregnancy was determined in 1704 subjects with 1582 (92.8%) within å± 7åÊdays from the gold-standard date of pregnancy onset. The delivery date was determined in 1654 subjects, and 1594 (96.4%) were within å± 7åÊdays before the true delivery date using the algorithm of ""selected"" diagnosis and a surgical procedure followed by some other delivery-related data.

In a subset of approximately 5000 case and control mothers from five us centers (2008-2012), a research nurse abstracted subjects' medical records. Ga at delivery was calculated as date of delivery minus (estimated date of confinement [edc] minus 280); if edc was unknown, last menstrual period served as a proxy for start of pregnancy. Positive and negative predictive values (ppv and npv, respectively) were calculated, using medical records as the standard, for categories of ga at delivery (ie, early preterm <238, late preterm <258, and term ‰ä´259 d) and birthweight (low <2500, normal 2500 to 4500, and high >4500 g).

A multinational cohort study based on existing data sources using a pre-/post- design was performed in five european countries (france, germany, spain, sweden, uk) in an outpatient setting. Effectiveness of rmms was assessed by comparing the proportion of valproate initiations as second (or subsequent) line therapy before and after implementation of rmms (primary outcome) with an increase in this proportion indicating success of rmms. Overall use of valproate and incidence of pregnancies in wcbp were also examined. The proportion of valproate initiations as second line therapy increased after implementation of rmms in incident female users in sweden (from 81.1%, 95% ci 79.9%-82.3% to 84.5%, 95% ci 83.5%-85.5%) and the uk (from 66.4%, 95% ci 64.5%-68.3% to 72.4%, 95% ci 70.0%-74.9%), it remained the same in germany and spain and decreased in france from 48.7% (95% ci 45.6%-51.9%) to 40.6% (95% ci 37.6%-43.7%).

A survey was conducted in 2020 among 300 cyd-tdv prescribers in brazil and thailand to ascertain three success criteria: prescribers' awareness of the materials (receiving and reading them); knowledge of the key messages; and whether their self-reported behaviour regarding practice-related scenarios was aligned with the updated guidance. The armms were not generally effective as <80% of prescribers in both countries met two of the three predefined success criteria. In brazil, 98.7% were aware of the armms whereas in thailand this criterion was fulfilled by 74.0%. Almost all prescribers knew that cyd-tdv was recommended only in individuals with pdi (98.7% and 96.7% in brazil and thailand, respectively). In brazil, where vaccination was restricted to those with a documented history of pdi, 11.3% considered that confirmation should be done through a blood test. More than 75% in both countries considered additional signs of dengue, as early warning signs, and not only those regarded as such by the 2009 who guidelines. These results do not support that the armms were effective as the predefined success criteria were not met.

Antimuscarinics are the backbone of the pharmacological management of overactive bladder. However, the safety profiles of antimuscarinics vary because of their dissimilarities to muscarinic receptor-subtype affinities and are associated with differential central anticholinergic adverse effects. This study aimed to examine delirium risk in new users of oxybutynin and solifenacin in older adults (‰ä´‰Ûä65‰Ûäyears). In the secondary analyses, we examined the risk of delirium by type and dose of antimuscarinic. We applied a case-time-control design to investigate delirium risk in older adults who started taking oxybutynin and solifenacin. We used a nationwide inpatient hospital data (2005-2016), national minimum data set, maintained by the ministry of health, new zealand (nz), to identify older adults with a new-onset diagnosis of delirium. Eligible patients were older adults aged 65 at entry into the cohort on 1/1/2006. We used dispensing claims data to determine antimuscarinic treatment exposure. The antimuscarinic included in the study were new users of oxybutynin and solifenacin. These two antimuscarinics are subsidised by the pharmaceutical management agency and are the most frequently used antimuscarinic in nz. A conditional logistic regression model was used to compute matched odds ratios (mors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). In the case-time-control design, we made separate analyses to evaluate the dose-response risk of delirium. We identified 4818 individuals (mean age 82.14) from 2005 to 2015 with incident delirium and were exposed to at least one of the antimuscarinic of interest. The case-time-control matched odds ratio (mor) for delirium with oxybutynin was (2.06, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.07-3.96). Solifenacin was not associated with delirium (0.89 95%ci 0.64-1.23). In the sensitivity analyses, the case-time-control mor for delirium using a shorter risk period (0-3‰Ûädays) did not change the results. The dose-response risk of delirium was significant for oxybutynin (0.05, 95%ci 0.02-0.08) but not for solifenacin (-0.01, 95%ci -0.03 to 0.00). In addition, in the subgroup analyses, a statistically significant association of delirium was found for oxybutynin but not for solifenacin in the non-dementia cohort (2.11,95% ci 1.08-4.13) and the dementia cohort (1.25, 95%ci 0.05-26.9). The study found that oxybutynin but not solifenacin is associated with a risk of new-onset delirium in older adults. The higher blockade of m1 and m2 receptors by oxybutynin is likely to contribute to delirium than solifenacin, which is highly selective for the m3 receptor subtype. Therefore, the treatment choice with an m3 selective agent must be given due consideration, particularly in those with pre-existing cognitive impairment.",35587029

This was an observational, prospective, multicenter study in france conducted over 1åÊyear. The study employed primary data collection in fbt-treated patients and their treating physicians via a site qualification questionnaire and patient log completed by physicians and a questionnaire and pain diary completed by patients. Strategies to increase participation included reminders, newsletters, frequent follow-up telephone calls, and reducing the extent of data collected. Of the 1118 physicians contacted who returned the participation form or responded to a telephone call, only 128 expressed willingness to participate. Key reasons for non-participation were lack of interest (69.7%) and fbt not being used in practice by the contacted physician (25.1%). Overall, 224 patients were screened by 31 physicians, and 97 were enrolled. Key reasons for patient non-inclusion were unwillingness or inability to complete the patient ae diary or questionnaire (40.9% [52/127]) and patients' decision (33.9% [43/127]). Despite efforts to increase participation, enrollment in this study was low. Recruitment and retention methods are limited in their capacity to optimally execute a primary data collection in a pass.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the power over time as data accrue in population-based registries for detecting deviations from the expected efficacy/safety of chimeric antigen receptor t cell (car-t) therapy approved for relapsed/refractory large b-cell lymphoma (rr-lbcl). The number of real-world rr-lbcl patients was projected over time in a general population of 5, 15, and 25 million citizens using lymphoma registry data. For each scenario, we computed the power over time for detecting significant deviations in efficacy (1-year overall survival [1yos]) when comparing to historical controls (scholar-1 study; 1yos, 28%) and rr-lbcl patients treated with car-t cell therapy in a single-arm trial (zuma-1; 1yos, 59%) as well as deviations in selected adverse events (grade ‰ä´3 aphasia) from the zuma-1 trial. We assumed a 10% absolute deviation in 1yos (efficacy) and a relative increase of 50% in grade ‰ä´3 aphasia (safety). Assuming a general population of 5, 15, and 25 million, the accrual time needed to achieve 80% power for detecting a significant increase over the 1yos reported in scholar-1 was 9, 4, and 3‰Ûäyears, respectively, while 80% power for detecting a significant decrease in 1yos compared to zuma-1 required 10.5, 4.5, and 3‰Ûäyears of data accrual, respectively.

We analyzed 25,111 japanese patients aged 75åÊyears and older between the fiscal years 2011 and 2016. Patients using dpp-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas (sus) were matched at a 1:1 ratio using propensity scoring. The incidence rate ratio (irr) of uti was compared between users of sus and users of dpp-4 inhibitors by poisson regression. Moreover, subgroup analyses stratified by sex were conducted to evaluate whether the combination of prostatic hyperplasia and dpp-4 inhibitors is associated with the incidence of uti in male patients. The use of dpp-4 inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of uti (adjusted irr 1.23, 95% ci [1.04-1.45]). After propensity score matching, the association remained significant (adjusted irr 1.28, 95% ci [1.05-1.56]).

We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for algorithms relative to medical chart review and conducted assessments of algorithm portability in kaiser permanente washington, tennessee state medicaid, and optum. Code-based algorithm performance was excellent for opioid-related overdoses (sensitivityåÊ=åÊ97.2%, specificityåÊ=åÊ84.6%) and classification of heroin-involved overdoses (sensitivityåÊ=åÊ91.8%, specificityåÊ=åÊ99.0%). Performance was acceptable for code-based suicide/suicide attempt classifications (sensitivityåÊ=åÊ70.7%, specificityåÊ=åÊ90.5%); sensitivity improved with nlp (sensitivityåÊ=åÊ78.7%, specificityåÊ=åÊ91.0%). Performance was acceptable for the code-based substance abuse-involved classification (sensitivityåÊ=åÊ75.3%, specificityåÊ=åÊ79.5%); sensitivity improved with the nlp-enhanced algorithm (sensitivityåÊ=åÊ80.5%, specificityåÊ=åÊ76.3%). The opioid-related overdose algorithm performed well across portability assessment sites, with sensitivity greater than 96% and specificity greater than 84%. Cross-site sensitivity for heroin-involved overdose was greater than 87%, specificity greater than or equal to 99%. Code-based algorithms developed to detect opioid-related overdoses and classify them according to heroin involvement perform well. Algorithms for classifying suicides/attempts and abuse-related opioid overdoses perform adequately for use for research, particularly given the complexity of classifying such overdoses. The nlp-enhanced algorithms for suicides/suicide attempts and abuse-related overdoses perform significantly better than code-based algorithms and are appropriate for use in settings that have data and capacity to use nlp.",31020755

A retrospective cohort study has been used linking pharmetrics, a commercial claims database, to a prescription database (lrx) that captures pharmacy dispensings independently of payment method, including cash transactions. We included adults with dispensings for opioids, diuretics, antiplatelet medications, or anticoagulants. To determine the degree of capture of dispensings, we calculated the number of subjects with the following: (1) same number of dispensings in both databases; (2) at least one dispensing, but not all dispensings, missed in pharmetrics; and (3) all dispensings missing in pharmetrics. Similar analyses were conducted using dispensings as the unit of analysis. To assess whether a dispensing in lrx was in pharmetrics, the dispensing in pharmetrics had to be for the same medication class and within å±7åÊdays in lrx. A total of 1åÊ426åÊ498 subjects were included. Overall, 68% of subjects had the same number of dispensings in both databases. In 13% of subjects, pharmetrics identified ‰ä´1 dispensing but also missed ‰ä´1 dispensing. In 19% of the subjects, pharmetrics missed all the dispensings. Taking dispensings as the unit of analysis, 25% of the dispensings present in lrx were not captured in pharmetrics. These patterns were similar across all four classes of medications. Of the dispensings missing in pharmetrics, 48% involved a subject who had >1 health insurance plan. Commercial claims databases provide an incomplete picture of all prescriptions dispensed to patients. The lack of capture goes beyond cash transactions and potentially introduces substantial misclassification bias. å© 2017 the authors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate as medication use and its association with vod within the german primary care setting. Cases with vod from the content (continuous morbidity registration epidemiologic network) database were 1:1 matched to controls on age, sex, and comorbidities by propensity score matching. As medication was defined using the fourth level of anatomical therapeutic chemical classification (atc) codes. A prescription of as medication any time within the study period formed the primary exposure. Multivariable conditional logistic regression examined the association between as use and vod. Of a total of nåÊ=åÊ151åÊ446 patients, 6971 (4.6%) cases and 6971 corresponding controls were analyzed (mean age (sd): 59.9åÊyears (20.9), 64.2% female). Dizziness and giddiness (icd-10 code r42) were diagnosed most prominently (87.2%). As medication was prescribed on 1072 of 10åÊ552 (10.2%) consultation days with vod diagnoses. After adjusting for covariates, as use was significantly and independently associated with vod, adjusted odds ratio (1.37; 95% ci: 1.18-1.58), compared with no as use. Primary care practitioners should consider as medication as a risk factor for vod and avoid prescribing as medications after a vod diagnosis. Caution should also be taken when prescribing as medications to older adults (‰ä´65åÊyears). Systematical calculations of as medication burden for patients could help acknowledge this issue and raise awareness for prescription habits in primary care.",29896933

This study was aimed at assessing the impact of this decision on the overall use of pregabalin in saudi arabia and in comparison with drugs prescribed to treat neuropathic pain (i.e., vs. Gabapentin, tramadol, duloxetine, and amitriptyline). This was an interrupted time-series analysis of the saudi quarterly sale data of the study drugs from october/2015 to september/2020. These data were obtained from iqvia and were converted into use estimates (defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitant-days [ddd/tid]). Segmented regression models were conducted to assess the direct (level) and prolonged (trend) changes in use data after the decision. All analyses were completed using rstudio version 1.4.1103. Before the sfda's decision, there was an increased quarter-to-quarter use of pregabalin (ddd/tid: 0.16; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.04 to 0.28). Pregabalin overall use dropped sharply by -1.85 ddd/tid (95% ci -2.71 to -0.99) directly after the decision with a prolonged quarter-to-quarter declining effect (ddd/tid: -0.22, ci to -0.37 to -0.05). The decision was associated with a direct increase in the use of gabapentin by 0.62 ddd/tid (95% ci 0.52-0.72) without any impact on the use of other drugs. The results of our study showed that the sfda decision was associated with a decrease in the overall use of pregabalin, which may help minimize the risk of its abuse and misuse.",35049110

We performed a narrative systematic review of studies using or describing development or validation of multimorbidity measures. We compared the number of diseases included in the measures, the process of data extraction (case definition) and the validation process. We assessed the methodological robustness using eight criteria, five based on general criteria for indicators (aire instrument) and three multimorbidity-specific criteria. Twenty-two multimorbidity measures were identified. The number of diseases they included ranged from 5 to 84 (medianåÊ=åÊ20), with 19 measures including both physical and mental conditions. Diseases were identified using icd codes extracted from inpatient and outpatient data (18/22) and sometimes including drug claims (10/22). The validation process relied mainly on the capacity of the measures to predict health outcome (5/22), or on the validation of each individual disease against a gold standard (8/22). Six multimorbidity measures met at least six of the eight robustness criteria assessed. There is significant heterogeneity among the measures used to assess multimorbidity in administrative databases, and about a third are of low to moderate quality. A more consensual approach to the number of diseases or groups of diseases included in multimorbidity measures may improve comparison between regions, and potentially provide better control for multimorbidity-related confounding in studies.",34623723

The benefits of sglt-2i from cardiovascular outcome trials may lead to preferential prescribing of sglt-2i to patients at high cardiovascular risk, possibly causing confounding in non-randomized studies of sglt-2i as first-line treatment. We assessed evolving imbalances in characteristics of patients starting sglt-2i versus metformin as first-line monotherapy. Using claims data from two us commercial health insurance and medicare, we identified patients with t2d aged ‰ä´18‰Ûäyears (>65‰Ûäyears in medicare) initiating first-line sglt-2i or metformin from 2013 through 2019. Standardized differences (sds) for patient characteristics were assessed during four consecutive calendar time blocks (t1:4/2013-12/2014; t2:1/2015-6/2016; t3:7/2016-12/2017; and t4:1/2018-12/2019). We also estimated the propensity score of receiving sglt-2i versus metformin within each time block and evaluated time trends in model discrimination with c-statistics. We identified 9113 initiators of first-line sglt-2i and 810‰Ûä348 initiators of first-line metformin. During t1, sglt-2i initiators were younger (sdåÊ=åÊ-0.24) and less likely to have seen cardiologists (-0.07) with a similar prevalence of cvd (0.04) compared with metformin. During t4, patients were more balanced for age (-0.01). Cardiologist visits (0.08) and cvd (0.25) became more prevalent among sglt-2i initiators. When comparing initiators of first-line sglt-2i versus metformin, imbalances in patient characteristics evolved from 2013 through 2019, particularly channeling sglt-2i to individuals at high cardiovascular risk.

Co-occurrence-based ml methods are rather basic, as they identify simultaneous appearance of drugs and clinical events in a single post. In contrast, statistical learning methods involve more complex nlp and identify drugs, events, and associations between them. We aimed to compare the ability of co-occurrence and nlp to identify aes and signals of disproportionate reporting (sdr) in patient-generated sm. We also examined the performance of lift in sm-based signal detection (sd). Our examination was performed in a corpus of sm posts crawled from open online patient forums and communities, using the spontaneously reported vigibase data as reference data set. We found that co-occurrence and nlp produce aes, which are 57% and 93% consistent with vigibase aes, respectively. Among the sdrs identified both in sm and in vigibase, up to 55.3% were identified earlier in co-occurrence, and up to 32.1% were identified earlier in nlp-processed sm. Using lift in sm sd provided performance similar to frequentist methods, both in co-occurrence and in nlp-processed aes. Our results indicate that using sm as a data source complementary to traditional pharmacovigilance sources should be considered further.

In march 2020 there was a short-term increase in the rate of opioid purchases in both developing (10.9åÊunits/1000 population increase; påÊ<‰Ûä0.0001) and developed (145.5åÊunits/1000 population; påÊ<‰Ûä0.0001) economies, which was followed immediately by reduced opioid purchasing of a similar scale in april-may 2020 (-14.8 and‰Ûä-171.8åÊunits/1000 population in developing and developed economies, respectively; påÊ<‰Ûä0.0001). The covid-19 pandemic led to disruptions in opioid purchasing around the world; although the specific impacts varied both between and among developed and developing economies. With global variation in opioid use, there is a need to monitor these trajectories to ensure the safety of opioid use, and adequate access to pain management globally.",35460142

This study compared the incidence of opioid prescribing in women undergoing pop transabdominal repair with mesh and transvaginal native tissue repair. A retrospective cohort of women undergoing pop transabdominal repair with mesh or transvaginal native tissue repair, was derived from a 10% random sample of enrollees from 2007 to 2015 within the iqvia pharmetricså¨ plus database. Primary outcomes were any prescription of opioids and cumulative days of opioids prescribed in the 14- 180‰Ûädays following surgical intervention. Inverse probability of treatment weights controlled for observed baseline confounders. Any opioid prescription was estimated using logistic regression and generalized linear regression for cumulative days of opioids prescribed. The cohort of 49‰Ûä052 women who underwent pop surgical repair included 46‰Ûä813 women with transvaginal native tissue repair and 2239 women with transabdominal repair with mesh. Women with a transabdominal repair with mesh had a 1.19 (95%ci: 1.09-1.31) significantly higher odds of receiving an opioid prescription than women with transvaginal native tissue repair. Post-operatively, over 29% of women received opioid prescriptions. Mean cumulative days of post-surgical opioid prescribing was 32.2 (sdåÊ=åÊ43.1), and was not statistically different between groups. Thirteen percent of women were prescribed opioids for 90‰Ûädays or more. Women undergoing pop with transabdominal mesh are more likely to receive prescriptions for opioids after surgery compared to transvaginal native tissue repair.

Empirical equipoise was previously proposed as a tool to assess patient similarity based on propensity scores (ps). We extended this work for multigroup observational studies. We modified the tool to allow for multinomial exposures such that the proposed definition reduces to the original when there are only two groups. We illustrated how the tool can be used as a method to assess study design within three-group clinical examples. We then conducted three-group simulations to assess how the tool performed in a setting with residual confounding after ps weighting. In a clinical example based on rheumatoid arthritis, 44.5% of the sample fell within the region of empirical equipoise when considering first-line biologics, whereas 57.7% did so for second-line biologics, consistent with the expectation that a second-line design results in better equipoise. In a simulation where the unmeasured confounder had the same magnitude of association with the treatment as the measured confounders and a 25% greater association with the outcome, the tool crossed the proposed threshold for empirical equipoise at a residual confounding of 20% on the ratio scale. When the unmeasured variable had a twice larger association with treatment, the tool became less sensitive and crossed the threshold at a residual confounding of 30%. Our proposed tool may be useful in guiding cohort identification in multigroup observational studies, particularly with similar effects of unmeasured and measured covariates on treatment and outcome.",31131965

We aimed to understand current practice in addressing this bias in pharmacoepidemiology database studies and to develop an open source application (app) from existing methodology to demonstrate the impact and mechanism of this bias on results. Studies of an exposure and a clinical outcome were selected from all pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety publications during 2017 and any reference to outcome misclassification described. An app to correct risk ratio (rr) and cumulative incidence for outcome misclassification was developed from a published methodology and used to demonstrate the impact of correction on point estimates. Eight (19%) of 43 papers selected reported estimates of outcome ascertainment accuracy with positive predictive value (ppv) the most commonly reported measure (7 of 8 studies). Three studies (7%) corrected for the bias, 1 by exposure strata, and 5 (12%) restricted analyses to confirmed cases. The app (app http://apps.p-95.com/ispe/) uses values of ppv and sensitivity (or a range of possible values) in each exposure strata and returns corrected point estimates and confidence intervals. The app demonstrates that small differences between comparison groups in ppv or sensitivity can introduce bias even when accuracy estimates are high. Outcome misclassification is not usually corrected in pharmacoepidemiology database studies although correction methods using routinely measured indices are available. Error indices are needed for each comparison group to correct rr estimates for these errors. The app should encourage understanding of this bias and increase adjustment.",32860317

The objective of this study was to identify signal characteristics associated with pi updates following signal evaluation by the european medicines agency pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee during 2012 to 2016. A comparative study was performed based on data from 172 safety signals. Characteristics of signals were extracted from the european pharmacovigilance issues tracking tool database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between signal characteristics and the decision to update the pi. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of evidence in multiple types of data sources (adjusted odds ratio [or] 7.8 95% ci [1.5, 40.1]); mechanistic plausibility of the drug-event association (adjusted or 3.9 95% ci [1.9, 8.0]); seriousness of the event (adjusted or 4.2 95% ci [1.3, 13.9]); and age of drugs ‰ä_5åÊyears (adjusted or 3.9 95% ci [1.2, 12.7]) were associated with the decision to change the pi (påÊ<åÊ0.05).

The secondary objectives were to highlight prescription transfers for metopimazine and to quantify the impact on health expenditures. All patients from a representative sample of a national administrative claims database, the french national health insurance database, were included between 2006 and 2016. Trends in annual anti-emetic prescription rates by general practitioners were analysed using logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender and the existence of cancer. The cost of theses changing prescription habits was quantified via mÌ©dic'am, a public drug expenditure database. Around 669‰Ûä020 individuals were included with a mean 8-year follow-up; 48‰Ûä634 patients received an anti-emetic at least once between 2006 and 2016. Prescription rates for all antiemetics decreased significantly from 2.1% to 0.4%, especially for metoclopramide from 0.5% to 0.1%, for domperidone from 1.5% to 0.1% and for metopimazine from 0.4% to 0.2%, which is not in favour of prescription transfers.

We conducted a rapid monitoring analysis to evaluate changes in health services utilization three months after the policy was introduced compared with a three-year period before the policy's introduction. Using the administrative claims data of the british columbia ministry of health, we assembled three historical cohorts and one policy cohort of users of each originator drug (8 cohorts in total). Cumulative incidences of medication refills, switching, and visits to physicians were the outcome measures used to compare policy and historical cohorts. Likelihood ratios were used to quantify statistical differences between each policy cohort and its respective historical controls.

Data for all treatment settings, private and public, for the years 2009 to 2016, were extracted from the israel ministry of health's pharmaceutical administration database. The data were used to calculate defined daily doses (ddd) per 1000 inhabitants per day, of the various drugs. Consumption of the 5 opioids increased by 68%, from 3.40 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day in 2009 to 5.72 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day in 2016. This trend resulted mostly from increases in oxycodone consumption from 0.50 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 2.03 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (namely, 4-fold) and in fentanyl consumption, from 1.09 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 2.33 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (about 2-fold). The use of the 3 remaining opioids decreased substantially as follows: pethidine from 0.03 ddd/1000/day in 2009 to 0.007 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day in 2016 (-67%), methadone from 1.61 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 1.20 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (-25%), and morphine from 0.17 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 0.15 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (-12%). An increasing trend was also observed in the use of oxycodone/naloxone (targin) and oxycodone/acetaminophen (percocet) combinations, while a decrease was observed in the use of pure oxycodone formulations. The increase in opioid consumption persisted throughout the years 2009 to 2016.

Structured medical record review was the gold standard for validating the presence of anticoagulant-related bleeding. Sensitivity was adjusted to correct for partial verification bias due to sampling design.

Bleeding codes in the primary position demonstrated high ppv (86.9%), but low adjusted sensitivity (36.0%). The adjusted sensitivity improved to 69.5% when codes in a secondary position were added. Only one adverse effect/poisoning code was used, appearing in 7.8% of cases and controls (ppv, 71.4% and adjusted sensitivity, 6.8%). Performance of icd-10-cm code assignments for bleeding among patients prescribed anticoagulants varied by bleed type and code position.

The aim of this study is to provide an overview and guidance on some of the available methodologies used to address problems related to time-varying exposure and confounding in pharmacoepidemiology and other observational studies. The methods are explored from a conceptual rather than an analytical perspective. The methods described in this study have been identified exploring the literature concerning to the time-varying exposure concept and basing the search on four fundamental pharmacoepidemiological problems, construction of treatment episodes, time-varying confounders, cumulative exposure and latency, and treatment switching. A correct treatment episodes construction is fundamental to avoid bias in treatment effect estimates. Several methods exist to address time-varying covariates, but the complexity of the most advanced approaches-eg, marginal structural models or structural nested failure time models-and the lack of user-friendly statistical packages have prevented broader adoption of these methods. Consequently, simpler methods are most commonly used, including, for example, methods without any adjustment strategy and models with time-varying covariates. The magnitude of exposure needs to be considered and properly modelled. Further research on the application and implementation of the most complex methods is needed. Because different methods can lead to substantial differences in the treatment effect estimates, the application of several methods and comparison of the results is recommended. Treatment episodes estimation and exposure quantification are key parts in the estimation of treatment effects or associations of interest.",29285840

However, the association remains poorly understood with previous studies obtaining conflicting results. To examine the effect of statin on the subsequent risk of diverticular disease. We conducted a nested case-control study in denmark among respondents (>18‰Ûäyears) of the 2010 or the 2013 danish national health survey. Among these, we identified 8809 cases of hospital-diagnosed diverticular disease and risk-set sampled population controls without diverticular disease. Using complete prescription and hospital records, we used conditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios (ors) associating statin use with diverticular disease. In adjusted analyses, we controlled for hospital-based diagnoses, medication use other than statins, and lifestyle and socioeconomic factors. The fully adjusted or for diverticular disease associated with ever use (‰ä´1 statin prescription filling) was 1.19 (95% ci: 1.12-1.27) compared with never use. However, we observed no dose-response relation. For example, among short-term users (<5‰Ûäyears), the or was 1.18 (95% ci: 1.04-1.35) for low intensity users and 1.13 (95% ci: 1.01-1.26) for high intensity users.

Our goal was to quantify the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions in drug prescriptions at danish hospitals, estimate the risk of adverse outcomes associated with discouraged drug combinations, and highlight the patient types (defined by the primary diagnosis of the admission) that appear to be more affected. This cross-sectional (descriptive part) and cohort study (adverse outcomes part) used hospital electronic health records from two danish regions (~2.5 million people) from january 2008 through june 2016. We included all inpatients receiving two or more medications during their admission and considered concomitant prescriptions of potentially interacting drugs as per the danish drug interaction database.

The epidemic began with an escalation of prescription opioid deaths and has now evolved to include secondary waves of illicit heroin and fentanyl deaths, while the deaths due to prescription opioid overdoses are still increasing. In response, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) moved to limit opioid prescribing with the release of opioid prescribing guidelines for chronic noncancer pain in march 2016. The guidelines represent a logical and timely federal response to this growing crisis. However, cdc acknowledged that the evidence base linking opioid prescribing to opioid use disorders and overdose was grades 3 and 4. Motivated by the need to strengthen the evidence base, this review details limitations of the opioid safety studies cited in the cdc guidelines with a focus on methodological limitations related to internal and external validity. Internal validity concerns were related to poor confounding control, variable misclassification, selection bias, competing risks, and potential competing interventions. External validity concerns arose from the use of limited source populations, historical data (in a fast-changing epidemic), and issues with handling of cancer and acute pain patients' data. We provide a nonexhaustive list of 7 recommendations to address these limitations in future opioid safety studies. Strengthening the opioid safety evidence base will aid any future revisions of the cdc guidelines and enhance their prevention impact.",29862602

The sniiram database merges anonymous information of reimbursed claims from all these plans, linked to the national hospital-discharge summaries database system (pmsi) and the national death registry. It now covers 98.8% of the french population, over 66 million persons, from birth (or immigration) to death (or emigration), making it possibly the world's largest continuous homogeneous claims database. The database includes demographic data; health care encounters such as physician or paramedical visits, medicines, medical devices, and lab tests (without results); chronic medical conditions (icd10 codes); hospitalisations with icd10 codes for primary, linked and associated diagnoses, date and duration, procedures, diagnostic-related groups, and cost coding; date but currently not cause of death. The power of the database is correlatively great, and its representativeness is near perfect, since it essentially includes the whole country's population. The main difficulty in using the database, beyond its sheer size and complexity, is the administrative process necessary to access it. Recent legislative advances are making this easier.

At two-monthly intervals, patients completed questionnaires on biological use, combination therapy and indication. The patient-reported information was compared with their electronic health records (ehrs) and analysed for percentage agreement and cohen's kappa. A reference population from a prospective ibd registry was used to assess the representativeness of the study population. In total, 182 patients (female 50.5%, mean age 42.2‰Ûäyears, cd 76.9%) were included in the analysis.

This study aimed to estimate (1) the prevalence of chronic pain and analgesia use in the australian population by age and sex; (2) the severity of pain in the population with chronic pain by sex; and (3) the distribution of recent pain severity in those using analgesia by age and sex. This study used cross-sectional, nationally representative data collected by the australian bureau of statistics 2011 to 2012 national health survey. A total of nåÊ=åÊ20åÊ426 participants were included with an overall response rate of 84.8%.

The prevalence of chronic and reoccurring pain (over a 6-month period) was 15.4% (2.75 million) for australians aged ‰ä´15åÊyears. Prevalence increased with age for both sexes. Significantly more females reported moderate-to-very severe pain overall (påÊ<åÊ0.001), and within most age groups. Recent use of opioid analgesia was reported by 12.0% of males and 13.4% of females with chronic pain. Chronic pain and opioid analgesic use are important public health issues in australia.

Postmarketing surveillance of newly marketed drugs, including novel biologics and biosimilars, requires a robust approach to convert icd-9 to icd-10 codes for study variables. We examined three mapping methods for health conditions (hcs) of interest to the biologics and biosimilars collective intelligence consortium (bbcic) and compared their prevalence. Using cms general equivalence mappings, we applied forward-backward mapping (fbm) to 108 hcs and secondary mapping (sm) and tertiary mapping (tm) to seven preselected hcs. A physician reviewed the mapped icd-10 codes. The prevalence of the 108 hcs defined by icd-9 versus icd-10 codes was examined in bbcic's distributed research network (september 1, 2012 to march 31, 2018). We visually assessed prevalence trends of these hcs and applied a threshold of 20% level change in icd-9 versus icd-10 prevalence. Nearly four times more icd-10 codes were mapped by sm and tm than fbm, but most were irrelevant or nonspecific. For conditions like myocardial infarction, sm or tm did not generate additional icd-10 codes. Through visual inspection, one-fifth of the hcs had inconsistent icd-9 versus icd-10 prevalence trends. 13% of hcs had a level change greater than +/-20%. Fbm is generally the most efficient way to convert icd-9 to icd-10 codes, yet manual review of converted icd-10 codes is recommended even for fbm.

It is important to prioritise critical product defects for review to ensure that prompt risk mitigation actions are taken. A regulatory risk impact prioritisation model for product defects (rismed) with 11 factors considering the seriousness and extent of impact of a defect was developed. The model generated an overall score that categorised cases into high, medium or low impact. The model was further developed into a statistical risk scoring model (stat-rismed) using multivariate logistic regression that classified cases into high and non-high impact. Both models were evaluated against an expert-derived gold standard annotation corpus and tested on an independent dataset. Product defect cases received from january 2011 to june 2020 (nåÊ=‰Ûä660) were used to train stat-rismed and cases from july 2020 to june 2021 (nåÊ=‰Ûä220) for validation. The stat-rismed identified four factors associated with high impact cases, namely defect classification based on meddra-hsa terms, therapeutic indication of product, detectability of defect and whether any overseas regulatory actions were performed. Compared to rismed, stat-rismed achieved an improved sensitivity (94% vs 42%) and positive predictive value (47% vs 43%) for the identification of high impact cases, against the gold standard labels. This study reported characteristics that predicts cases with high impact, and the use of a statistical model to identify such cases.

We implemented segmented regression of interrupted time series analysis to estimate changes in the monthly prevalence of targeted medications, overall and stratified by age. Trends were compared in the 4-year period before and the 3-year period after implementation of pa policies. Antipsychotics prescribing significantly decreased 6.74/10‰Ûä000 (95% ci, -9.04 to -4.44) enrollees per month immediately after pa implementation. However, pa was not associated with significant long-term trend changes (-0.06; 95% ci, -0.16 to 0.03).

Paracetamol poisonings were defined by serum paracetamol levels, hospital diagnoses, or cause of death. The change in incidence of poisonings following increased availability of paracetamol was analysed by using segmental regression of time series. Of the 12åÊ068 paracetamol poisonings, 85% were classified as intentional self-harm. Following increased availability from non-pharmacy outlets, there was a 40.5% increase in the incidence of paracetamol poisoning, from 11.5/100åÊ000 in 2009 to 16.2/100åÊ000 in 2013.

Adjusting for trends in hospital episodes for self-harm, suicides, and the sales volume of paracetamol did not influence the result. All-cause mortality at 30åÊdays (3.2%) did not change over time. The incidence of paracetamol poisoning in sweden has increased since 2009, contrasting the decreased incidence in the period of 2007-2009.

Using the 2011 to 2015 truven health marketscan database, we identified pregnancies, including losses and terminations. In a cohort design, nonpregnant women filling a prescription for isotretinoin or tretinoin were matched to five women without either prescription. Women were followed for 365 days or until conception, medication discontinuation, or enrollment discontinuation (""prescription episode""). Rates of pregnancy, risks of pregnancy losses, and prevalence of infant malformations at birth were assessed by exposure. We identified 2 179 192 livebirths, 8434 stillbirths, 2521 mixed births, 415 110 spontaneous abortions, 124 556 elective terminations, and 8974 unspecified abortions.

Risk of spontaneous pregnancy losses were similar; however, terminations were more common in the isotretinoin-exposed (28% [95% ci: 21%-36%]) than the tretinoin-exposed (10% [95% ci: 9%-11%]) or unexposed pregnancies (6%). Malformations occurred in 4.5% (95% ci: 3.5%-5.6%) of the tretinoin-exposed pregnancies and 4.2% of the unexposed pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio: 1.16 [95% ci: 0.85-1.58]); isotretinoin-exposed births were too few to assess malformations. Administrative databases can complement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (rems) for known teratogens and contribute to safety surveillance for other medications. Here, isotretinoin-exposed pregnancy rates were low, but existent, and many pregnancies were terminated. Tretinoin exposure was not associated with a meaningfully elevated risk of losses or malformations as compared with unexposed pregnancies.",31328328

Administrative data on all thr/tkr quebec patients in 2009 to 2010 were obtained. The performance of bayesian external, bayesian internal, and mi approaches to correct the odds ratio (or) of postsurgery vte in tertiary versus community hospitals was assessed using simulations. Bayesian external approach used prior information from external sources, while bayesian internal and mi approaches used chart review. In total, 17åÊ319 patients were included, 2136 in participating hospitals, among whom 75 had vte in administrative data versus 81 in chart review. Vte sensitivity was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.69) and specificity was 0.99 (0.98-0.99), overall. The adjusted or of vte in tertiary versus community hospitals was 1.35 (1.12-1.64) using administrative data, 1.45 (0.97-2.19) when mi was used for misclassification correction, and 1.53 (0.83-2.87) and 1.57 (0.39-5.24) when bayesian internal and external approaches were used, respectively.

We conducted a dynamic cohort study using medication administration data from 68 residential aged care facilities (racfs) during 2014 to 2017. Descriptive statistics and regression were used to estimate the proportion of residents who used nsaids, nsaids long term, nsaids with ppis, and the triple whammy combination. Ten thousand three hundred sixty-seven residents were included. Two thousand four hundred fourteen (23.3%) used at least one nsaid: 756 (7.3%) used only oral, 1326 (12.8%) used only topical, and 332 (3.2%) used both topical and oral nsaids. One thousand five hundred forty two (14.8%) used an nsaid long term, a majority of which only used topical nsaids 933/1542 (60.5%). Age, sex, and health status were associated with greater variation in long-term topical use relative to oral nsaid use.

A structured form was used to systematically analyse the extent to which individual studies would have been possible using a database with data collection restrictions in place: (1) retrospective collection of specified diseases only; (2) retrospective collection restricted to a 6- or 12-year period; (3) prospective and retrospective collection restricted to non-sensitive data. Outcomes were categorised as unfeasible (not reproducible without major bias); compromised (feasible with design modification); or unaffected. Overall, 91% studies were compromised with all restrictions in place; 56% studies were unfeasible even with design modification. With restrictions on diseases alone, 74% studies were compromised; 51% were unfeasible. Restricting collection to 6/12 years had a major impact, with 67 and 22% of studies compromised, respectively.

Previous research has considered hypothetical sensitivity and specificity values, whereas this study aims to assess the impact of literature-based real values of exposure misclassification. A synthetic cohort study was constructed based on the proportion of exposure theoretically captured in a database (range 0.5-1.0) and the level of adherence (0.5-1.0). Three scenarios were explored: nondifferential misclassification, differential misclassification (misclassifications dependent on an unmeasured risk factor doubling the outcome risk), and nondifferential misclassification in a comparative effectiveness study (rr  and rr  both 2.0 compared to nonuse, rr  1.0). For the scenarios with nondifferential misclassification, 25% nonadherence or 25% uncaptured exposure changed the rr from 2.0 to 1.75, and 1.95, respectively. Applying different proportions of nonadherence or uncaptured use (20% vs. 40%) for subgroups with and without the risk factor, an rr of 0.95 was observed in the absence of a true effect (i.e., true rråÊ=åÊ1). In the comparative effectiveness study, no effect on rr was seen for different proportions of uncaptured exposure; however, different levels of nonadherence for the drugs (20% vs. 40%) led to an underestimation of rr  (0.89). All scenarios led to biased estimates, but the magnitude of the bias differed across scenarios.

Retrospective cohort study of 201 940 tennessee medicaid enrollees 12 to 17 years of age without cancer, other severe conditions, or evidence of substance abuse with 529 731 filled prescriptions for study opioids. Adverse events were defined as an emergency department visit, hospital admission, or death related to opioid use, confirmed by medical record review. Serious events had opioid-related escalation of care, hospitalization, or death. Propensity-score adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) were calculated with hydrocodone as the reference category. The incidence of opioid-related adverse events per 10 000 person-years of opioid exposure was 97.5 for hydrocodone (127 events/13 026 person-years), 91.2 for codeine (58/6,359), 229.7 for oxycodone (43/1,872), and 317.7 for tramadol (47/1479).

This study aimed to evaluate the potential bias introduced by differential imaging assessment frequency when using electronic health record (ehr)-derived data to investigate the comparative effectiveness of cancer therapies. Using a nationwide de-identified ehr-derived database, we first analyzed imaging assessment frequency patterns in patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ansclc). We used those rwd inputs to develop a discrete event simulation model of two treatments where disease progression was the outcome and pfs was the endpoint. Using this model, we induced bias with differential imaging assessment timing and quantified its effect on observed versus true treatment effectiveness. We assessed percent bias in the estimated hazard ratio (hr). The frequency of assessments differed by cancer treatment types. In simulated comparative-effectiveness studies, pfs hrs estimated using real-world imaging assessment frequencies differed from the true hr by less than 10% in all scenarios (range: 0.4% to -9.6%). The greatest risk of biased effect estimates was found comparing treatments with widely different imaging frequencies, most exaggerated in disease settings where time to progression is very short. This study provided evidence that the frequency of imaging assessments to detect disease progression can differ by treatment type in real-world patients with cancer and may induce some bias in comparative-effectiveness studies in some situations.",34227170

There were 242åÊ349 matched patients (median age 76 [interquartile range 70-82], male 39.3%) with and without ckd. Prevalence of antidepressant prescribing was 16.3 and 11.9%, and incidence was 57.2 and 42.4/1000 person-years, in patients with and without ckd, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, ckd remained associated with higher prevalence and incidence of antidepressant prescription. Regardless of ckd status, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were predominantly prescribed for depression or anxiety, while tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed for neuropathic pain or other reasons. Antidepressant choice was similar in depressed patients with and without ckd.

Cost values were expressed in euro 2015. A narrative synthesis was performed. A total of 4572 articles were identified from database searching, and 16 were included in the review. One study met all applicable quality criteria. Fifteen studies expressed economic impact in monetary terms. Mean cost per error per study ranged from ‰âÂ2.58 to ‰âÂ111åÊ727.08. Healthcare costs were used to measure economic impact in 15 of the included studies with one study measuring litigation costs. Four studies included costs incurred in primary care with the remaining 12 measuring hospital costs. Five studies looked at general medication error in a general population with 11 studies reporting the economic impact of an individual type of medication error or error within a specific patient population. Considerable variability existed between studies in terms of financial cost, patients, settings and errors included. Many were of poor quality. Assessment of economic impact was conducted predominantly in the hospital setting with little assessment of primary care impact. Limited parameters were used to establish economic impact.

The goal of this article is to provide clarity and guidance on issues related to confounding and provide motivation for using more flexible models for causal inference in pharmacoepidemiology. In this article we elucidate two important components of making valid inference from observational data: measuring the necessary set of variables at the design/data collection phase (measured confounding) and properly accounting for confounding at the modeling/analysis phase (accounted-for confounding). For the latter concept, we contrast parametric modeling approaches, which are susceptible to model misspecification bias, with data adaptive approaches. Both measuring and properly accounting for confounding is critical to obtaining valid causal inference from pharmacoepidemiology studies. Carefully thought out dags, based on subject matter knowledge, can help to better identify confounders and confounding. Even when confounding has been adequately measured, mis-specified models may lead to unaccounted for confounding and increasing the sample size often does not help. We recommend modern analytic techniques such as flexible data adaptive approaches that do not rely on strong parametric assumptions. Further, sensitivity analyses and other modern bounding approaches are recommended to account for the effects of unmeasured confounding. Confounding must be considered at both the design and analysis stages of a study. Dags and data adaptive approaches can help.",33372303

In contrast, observational studies associate glucosamine with significant reductions in mortality and cancer incidence. We evaluated the extent of bias, particularly selection bias, to explain these surprising beneficial effects. We searched the literature to identify all observational studies reporting on the effect of glucosamine use on major outcomes.

We show that these significant effects can result from selection bias due to collider stratification, as all studies used ""prevalent"" cohorts, where glucosamine use started before cohort entry, and where subjects agreed to join the cohorts. Our illustration of the bias using the uk biobank publication involving a half-million subjects shows how a true rate ratio of mortality of 1.0 in the population can result in a biased rate ratio of 0.82 in the prevalent cohort. The observational studies reporting significant reductions in mortality, cancer incidence and other outcomes with glucosamine were affected by selection bias from collider stratification.

Secondary endpoints were ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and all-cause mortality. The mean patient age was 73‰Ûäyears; 67% were men. Antiplatelets were administered in 25% of patients and 27% had history of cad. Cumulative incidences of ischemic events and major bleedings at 4‰Ûäyears were 5.9% and 9.6% in the apt group and 5.3% and 7.0% in the no-apt group, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) (95% confidence intervals [cis]) of the apt group for ischemic events and major bleedings were 1.12 (0.84-1.49) and 1.26 (1.01-1.57), respectively. The adjusted hrs (95% cis) for ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and all-cause mortality were 1.16 (0.86-1.57), and 1.31 (0.70-2.48), and 1.02 (0.82-1.26), respectively. Apt in patients taking oacs for nvaf did not prevent ischemic events but significantly increased major bleedings in the real-world setting.",33715291

We conducted a review of newly published studies on this topic to determine what new evidence exists and to identify which gaps may still remain. We believe that this information can support fda as it develops and implements future risk communication approaches. We searched pubmed and embase for studies published between january 1, 2010, and august 7, 2017 that examined the impact of labeling changes or associated fda safety-related communications. For each study, we extracted information on research design and findings for key clinical outcomes and behaviors. We also conducted a robins-i review to identify potential for bias in the research design of each study. We found that the estimated impacts of fda labeling changes on several key outcomes-including adverse events-varied. Labeling changes also yielded unintended consequences on drug prescribing in some cases, despite low provider adherence. Finally, some studies we reviewed exhibited potential for bias due to confounding, among other factors. The new studies we reviewed contain many of the same limitations identified in previously published reviews. While there are several challenges to conducting this research there is substantial room for improvement in the quality of the evidence base. More information, particularly with respect to the types of populations and medications affected by labeling changes, is needed to support the development of more effective and targeted safety communications.",32790031

We compared initiators of pcsk9i to ezetimibe and high-intensity statin by estimating one-year risks of negative control outcomes influenced by frailty or health-seeking behaviors. Inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted estimators of risk differences (rds) were used to evaluate residual confounding after controlling for covariates. Pcsk9i initiators had lower one-year risks of negative control outcomes associated with frailty, such as decubitus ulcer in the ascvd cohort (pcsk9i vs. High-intensity statin rdåÊ=åÊ-3.5%, 95% confidence interval (ci): -4.6%, -2.5%; pcsk9i vs. Ezetimibe rdåÊ=åÊ-1.3%, 95% ci: -2.1%, -0.6%), with similar but attenuated associations in the llt cohort. Lower risks of accidents and fractures were also observed for pcsk9i, varying by cohort. Risks were similar for outcomes associated with health-seeking behaviors, although trended higher for pcsk9i in the ascvd cohort. Observed associations suggest lower frailty and potentially greater health-seeking behaviors among pcsk9i initiators, particularly those with a recent ascvd diagnosis, with the potential to bias real-world analyses of treatment effectiveness.",34894377

Cases were verified by a systematic chart review. Poisson regression was used to compare incidence in defined time windows following vaccination. Of 266 cases of narcolepsy identified, 25% (66/266) were prevalent cases with symptom onset documented before vaccine exposure. Incident cases had a median time interval between first symptom and the date recorded in the patient registry of 64åÊweeks (iqr 39-107) when vaccinated (nåÊ=åÊ182) and 65åÊweeks (iqr 51-72) when unvaccinated (nåÊ=åÊ16).

Using the index date from the patient registry, the adjusted increase in risk was about seven times elevated for all three time intervals. The magnitude of the estimated increased risk for narcolepsy following exposure to the a(h1n1) pandemic vaccine is highly dependent on the method used to determine the index date for disease onset.

We developed an estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation for the reverse waiting time distribution (wtd), which is the distribution of time from the last prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of the time window. The reverse wtd consists of two distinctly different components: one component for prevalent users and one for patients stopping treatment. We extended the model to allow parameters of the reverse wtd to depend on linear combinations of covariates to obtain estimates and confidence intervals for percentiles of the inter-arrival density (time from one prescription to the subsequent). We applied the method to redemptions of warfarin, using the amount of drug filled, patient sex and patient age as covariates. The estimated prescription durations increased with redeemed amount and age. Women generally had longer prescription durations, which increased more with age than men. For 70-year-old women redeeming 300+ pills, we predicted a 95th percentile of the inter-arrival density of 225 (95%ci: 201, 249)åÊdays. For 50-year-old men redeeming 100 pills, the corresponding prediction was 97 (88, 106)åÊdays. The algorithm allows estimation of prescription durations based on the reverse wtd, which can depend upon observed covariates. Statistical uncertainty intervals and tests allow statistical inference on the influence of observed patient and prescription characteristics. The method may replace ad hoc decision rules.

Prescriptions were evaluated in 3-year intervals. The proportion of scd visits that included new/continued hydroxyurea prescriptions increased from less than or equal to 8% before 2009 to 33% in 2015 to 2017. The increase was significant in visits by children (2.5% in 1997-1999 to 47% in 2015-2017; p = .003 by spearman's rank-order correlation) but not in adults (6.9% to 11%; p = .12). Opioids, started/continued in 13% (lowest 3-year average) to 35% (highest) of visits by children and 55% to 81% of visits by adults, remained the most frequently prescribed medications for scd overall.

Hematologists/oncologists accounted for a higher proportion of visits by children (67.2% over 1997-2017) than adults (25.2%), while emergency medicine visits were higher in adults (14.0%) than children (2.6%). This study suggests a robust increase in hydroxyurea prescribing for children with scd. The baby hug trial, which demonstrated safety and efficacy of starting hydroxyurea in infancy and informed current scd guidelines recommending broader use in children, may have contributed to this increase. However, hydroxyurea prescribing for adults remains infrequent and considerably lower than opioids. Barriers in access to specialist care persist for adults with scd.",31328369

Claims database.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.5021,"Studies of medication persistence in plaque psoriasis have shown inconsistent results, likely due to differing definitions of nonpersistence and of the permissible gap between refills. Also, medication persistence information for two recently approved drugs, apremilast and ixekizumab, is limited. We use the truven health marketscan claims database to assess persistence for six drugs: adalimumab, apremilast, etanercept, ixekizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab. We define the permissible gap in three ways: 150‰Ûädays for ustekinumab and 90‰Ûädays for all other drugs (150/90 model); 120‰Ûädays for all drugs (120 model); and twice the days' supply for all drugs (days' supply model). To estimate unadjusted persistence, we use kaplan-meier curves, and a proportional hazards model to estimate the adjusted risk of non-persistence. Ustekinumab is most sensitive to changes in the definition of permissible gap, likely because of its longer maintenance dosing interval. Among targeted drug-experienced patients using ustekinumab, median persistence is 358‰Ûädays (95% confidence interval: 343-371) in the 150/90 model and 189‰Ûädays (179-199) in the days' supply model. Among targeted drug-experienced patients, median persistence in the days' supply model is longest for ixekizumab and secukinumab at 252 (217-301) and 222 (210-244) days, respectively.

In simulations, the multiple imputation approach yielded less biased hr estimates and appropriate coverage for both non-differential and differential misclassification. Large variations in the corrected hr estimates were observed using validation subsamples with low participation proportion. The bias correction was sometimes outweighed by the uncertainty introduced by the unknown time of event occurrence. Multiple imputation is useful to correct for outcome misclassification in time-to-event analyses if complementary validation data are available from subsamples.

To evaluate the safety of fluoroquinolones with regard to risk of diagnosed neurological dysfunction. We conducted a propensity score-matched inception cohort study using claims data from a commercially insured population. Our study included adults prescribed an oral fluoroquinolone or comparator antibiotic between january 2000 and september 2015 for acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, uncomplicated urinary tract infection, or acute bronchitis. Our outcomes were cns dysfunction, and four separate but complementary pns dysfunction outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models were estimated after matching on propensity scores fitted using the variables age, sex, epilepsy, hereditary peripheral neuropathy, renal dysfunction, diabetes, gabapentinoid use, statin use, isoniazid use, and chemotherapy use. Our cohort contained 976‰Ûä568 individuals exposed to a fluoroquinolone antibiotic matched 1:1 with a comparator. Matching produced balance (standardized mean difference‰Ûä<0.1) on all variables included in the propensity score. The hazard ratio associated with fluoroquinolone exposure was 1.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05-1.11) for cns dysfunction, and 1.09 (95% ci 1.07-1.11) for the most commonly occurring pns dysfunction outcome.

We assessed whether diagnosis codes for type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and iron deficiency or unspecified anemia were accompanied by supporting codes including lab results and treatments (correctness) and whether lab results, treatments, or other codes indicate a missing diagnosis record (completeness). Among 37‰Ûä502 patients in cprd aurum, correctness of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and anemia diagnoses was high (99%, 93%, and 97%, respectively).

Our findings indicate that for studies of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and iron deficiency or unspecified anemia, the diagnosis code is likely to be correct where present. However, a significant proportion of cases of hyperlipidemia or anemia will be missed if only diagnosis codes are used to select patients with these conditions.

We used conception, a critical biological period, as an intervention in a novel application of interrupted time series analysis (itsa). Among 645‰Ûä049 pregnancies from the medical birth registry (2005-2015) linked to the norwegian prescription database, we modeled the total number of prescription fills in the 12 weeks before and after estimated conception date with itsa. We examined psychostimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiepileptics (aeds; separated by use for epilepsy or other indications). We used relative measures (%) to compare model coefficients. We also compared number of pregnancies defined as exposed when the earliest fill considered was 30 days before the last menstrual period (lmp -30 days), lmp, or estimated conception date (lmp +14 days). We observed a sudden decline in prescription fills from 2 weeks after conception and decreasing fills thereafter for psychostimulants, antidepressants, aeds for other indications, and antipsychotics excluding incident users. Fills for aeds for epilepsy did not fall after conception. Only 77% of pregnancies with fills for psychostimulants from lmp and 58% with fills from lmp -30 days had fills from conception. Similar figures for aeds for epilepsy were 99% and 96%.

The national health insurance research database (nhird) which covers over 99.9% of the taiwanese population served as the comparator in this study. We compare the data components of the cgrd with the nhird, including records for health care facilities, patients, diagnoses, drugs, and procedures. Using the chi-square test, we compared the distributions of age categories and sex of patients, and the rates of their health conditions between nhird and cgrd based on the year 2015. The cgrd contains more clinical information such as pathological and laboratory results than the nhird. The cgrd includes 6.1% of outpatients and 10.2% of hospitalized patients from the nhird. We found the cgrd includes more elderly outpatients (23.5% vs 12.5%) and pediatric inpatients (19.7% vs 14.4%) compared with the nhird. We found patients' sex distributions were similar between cgrd and nhird, but coverage rates of severe conditions, such as cancer, were higher than other health conditions in cgrd.

A secondary objective was to determine whether posts revealed that the adf led to cessation of oxycontin use. Data were collected with the researched abuse, diversion, and addiction-related surveillance system web monitoring program, an online surveillance system that collects and organizes posts about prescription drugs from social media websites, blogs, and forums from 3q2009 to 4q2014 using a commercially available web platform. Posts were categorized by whether they conveyed a switch to drugs other than reformulated oxycontin or a continuation of reformulated oxycontin abuse. ""switch posts"" primarily discussed switching to immediate-release opioids. ""continue abusing"" posts identified tampering strategies for alternate routes of administration, oral use, and continued use although post authors were generally unhappy with the experience. No reference to oxycontin cessation as a function of the introduction of the adf was found; however, discontinued use was discussed. Web monitoring data are useful for capturing cross sections of internet conversation reflecting reactions to new drug formulations.

In august 2019, two authors independently searched pubmed, embase, and psycinfo to retrieve observational epidemiological studies presenting an association between aspirin use and depression. Case-control and cohort studies were included, and odds ratios (ors) or relative risks (rrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for the risk of depression were estimated using a random-effects model. In addition, number needed to harm (nnh) was calculated to measure the rates of depression. In total, 12 observational studies-five case-control studies and seven prospective cohort studies-were included in this meta-analysis. The random-effects model demonstrated a significant association between aspirin use and depression (or/rr 1.10; 95% ci: 1.05-1.16) with insignificant heterogeneity (i  = 23.3%). The risk estimates of depression from prospective cohort studies were similar (rr 1.11; 95% ci: 1.08-1.14), and heterogeneity was not observed (i  = 0.0%).

Furthermore, it is unknown whether gastrointestinal complaints occur more frequently in dabigatran users compared with other direct oral anticoagulant (doacs) users. We investigated the association between doac use (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) and subsequent ppi initiation as a proxy for gastrointestinal complaints. In this population-based observational study with an active-comparator new user study design, anonymised dispensing data from community pharmacies in the netherlands from 2012 to 2016 were used.

The approaches undergoing empirical validation covered assumptions of a fixed daily intake of either 0.5 or 1.0 defined daily dose (ddd), as well as estimates based on the reverse parametric waiting time distribution (rwtd), with different sets of covariates. We converted estimates of prescription duration to daily dose and compared them to prescribed daily dose as recorded in a clinical registry (using bland-altman plots). Methods were compared based on their average prediction error (logarithmic scale) and their limit of agreement ratio (ratio of mean erroråÊå±åÊ1.96 sd after transformation to original scale). Estimates of daily doses were underestimated by 19% or overestimated by 62% when assumptions of 0.5 or 1.0 ddd were applied. The limit of agreement ratio was 6.721 for both assumptions. The rwtd-based approaches performed better when using the estimated mean value of the inter-arrival density, yielding on average negligible bias (relative difference of 0 to 2%) and with limit of agreement ratios decreasing upon additional covariate adjustment (from 6.857 with no adjustment to 4.036 with the fully adjusted model).

However, in daily practice, to treat patients adequately, there is a medical need for drugs that do not hold ma. To meet this medical need, medicinal products are used in clinical care without ma (unlicensed), such as products prepared by (local) pharmacies: the pharmaceutical preparations. Three types of pharmaceutical preparations are distinguished: (i) reconstitution in excess of summary of product characteristics; (ii) adaptation of a licensed medicinal product (outside its official labeling); (iii) medicinal products from an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Although unlicensed, patients may expect the same quality for these unlicensed pharmaceutical preparations as for the licensed medicinal products. To assure this quality, a proper risk-benefit assessment and proper documentation in (centralized) patient registries and linking to a national pharmacovigilance database should be in place. Based on a risk assessment matrix, requirements for quality assurance can be determined, which has impact on the level of documentation of a pharmaceutical preparation. In this paper, the approach for good documentation including quality assurance and benefit-risk assessment will be discussed and possibilities for patient registries are described to make these crucial preparations available for regular patient care. Key points ensuring pharmaceutical quality and performing a proper benefit-risk assessment will guarantee safe use of pharmaceutical preparations. Good documentation of (ultra-)orphan treatments can be collected in centralized patient registries and should be combined with existing information in (inter)national databases and self-reflection of patients. Linking patient registries to a centralized database for adverse drug events is highly recommended as it increases safety control of the (ultra) orphan pharmaceutical preparations.",29047193

For antidepressant users, numbers of prescriptions, frequencies of disorders/diseases, and specialties of the prescribing physicians were examined. The share of off-label prescriptions was calculated for each year. The prescription prevalence of antidepressants ranged between 1.7 and 2.1 per 1000 minors. The use of tricyclic antidepressants decreased from 0.9 to 0.6 prescriptions per 1000 minors, while the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increased from 0.5 to 1.1. Of the patients with an antidepressant prescription, 46.4% only received one prescription. Depression was by far the most frequent diagnosis among all antidepressant users as well as among subjects with only one prescription. In 2011, 36.3% of all prescriptions were off-label. The high proportion of single prescriptions, even in patients with a diagnosed depression, and the high rate of off-label use are particularly noteworthy and should be further investigated in future studies.

Both lasso and random forest are appealing modeling methods, yet it is not clear which method performs better for clinical risk prediction. To compare models developed using lasso versus random forest for predicting neurological dysfunction among fluoroquinolone users. We developed and validated risk prediction models using claims data from a commercially insured population. The study cohort included adults dispensed an oral fluoroquinolone, and outcomes were cns and pns dysfunction. Model predictors included demographic variables, comorbidities and medications known to be associated with neurological symptoms, and several healthcare utilization predictors. We assessed the accuracy and calibration of these models using measures including auc, calibration curves, and brier scores. The underlying cohort contained 16‰Ûä533 (1.18%) individuals with cns dysfunction and 46‰Ûä995 (3.34%) individuals with pns dysfunction during 120‰Ûädays of follow-up. For cns dysfunction, lasso had an auc of 0.81 (95% ci: 0.80, 0.82), while random forest had an auc of 0.80 (95% ci: 0.80, 0.81). For pns dysfunction, lasso had an auc of 0.75 (95% ci: 0.74, 0.76) versus an auc of 0.73 (95% ci: 0.73, 0.74) for random forest. Both lasso models had better calibration, with brier scores 0.17 (lasso) versus 0.20 (random forest) for cns dysfunction and 0.20 (lasso) versus 0.25 (random forest) for pns dysfunction. Lasso outperformed random forest in predicting cns and pns dysfunction among fluoroquinolone users, and should be considered for modeling when the cohort is modest in size, when the number of model predictors is modest, and when predictors are primarily binary.",34881470

The study was conducted using the flatiron health oncology database and the national death index (ndi) as a gold standard. Three analytic frameworks were evaluated in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ansclc) patients: median overall survival [mos]), relative risk estimates conducted within the ehr-derived database, and ""external control arm"" analyses comparing an experimental group augmented with mortality data from the gold standard to a control group from the ehr-derived database only. The hazard ratios (hrs) obtained within the ehr-derived database (91% sensitivity) and the external control arm analyses, were compared with results when both groups were augmented with mortality data from the gold standard. The above analyses were repeated using simulated lower mortality sensitivities to understand the impact of more extreme levels of missing deaths. Bias in mos ranged from modest (0.6-0.9 mos.) in the ehr-derived cohort with (91% sensitivity) to substantial when lower sensitivities were generated through simulation (3.3-9.7 mos.). Overall, small differences were observed in the hrs for the ehr-derived cohort across comparative analyses when compared with hrs obtained using the gold standard data source. When only one treatment arm was subject to estimation bias, the bias was slightly more pronounced, but increased substantially when lower sensitivities were simulated. The impact on survival analysis is minimal with high mortality sensitivity with only modest impact associated within external control arm applications.",30873729

Medication exposure is associated with frailty among older adults without id. However, there is little research on this association among older adults with id. The aim of this study was to examine specifically in people with id the association between frailty and medication exposure, including anticholinergic and sedative medication exposure. Data were drawn from wave 2 (2013/2014) of the intellectual disability supplement to the irish longitudinal study on ageing (ids-tilda), a nationally representative study of older adults with id in ireland. A modified version of fried's frailty phenotype was constructed. Drug burden measures were polypharmacy, drug burden index (dbi), anticholinergic cognitive burden (acb) and sedative load model. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and identify associations between frailty and drug burden. This study included 570 participants with id. Excessive polypharmacy (use of ‰ä´10 medications) was significantly associated with being pre-frail (p =‰Ûä.017; or = 2.56; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.19-5.50) and frail (p <‰Ûä.001; or 7.13; 95% ci 2.81-18.12), but dbi, acb or sedative load score were not significantly associated with frailty status (p >‰Ûä.05).

The purpose of this study is to identify the proportion of new fts users who had evidence of prior opioid tolerance, by dosage strength, in fda's sentinel system. We identified new fts episodes (183-day washout) from 2009 through 2013. Members were <65åÊyears and enrolled in medical and pharmacy coverage for 183åÊdays prior to initial fts dispensing (index). We assessed the proportion of users with prior tolerance stratified by dosage strength of fts using four definitions of opioid tolerance: ‰ä´30-mg oxycodone equivalents/day in each of 7 consecutive days immediately prior to index; ‰ä´30-mg oxycodone equivalents/day for any 7åÊdays in the 30åÊdays prior to index (secondary); any dose in each of 7åÊdays in the 7 consecutive days immediately prior to index (tertiary); and any dose for any 7åÊdays in the 30åÊdays prior to index (quaternary). Of 44åÊ450 episodes of 25 mcg/hr fts, 37% met the primary definition, and 77% met the quaternary definition. Of 3507 episodes of 100 mcg/hr fts, 57% and 74% met the primary and quaternary definitions, respectively. Those aged 25 to 34åÊyears had the highest proportion of episodes with prior tolerance; those aged 55 to 64 accounted for more of the episodes overall. In sentinel, many new users of fts did not have evidence of prior opioid tolerance by the primary definition, ie, the product label definition, which is the minimum standard for the lowest fts dose (12 mcg/hr), especially at the highest strength (100 mcg/hr). Validation of this metric is warranted, but our findings suggest the need for further prescriber education regarding appropriate prescribing of fts.",30379379

Risk perceptions of paracetamol use in relation to sex, age, and education were determined using logistic regression. Most respondents (70.5%) reported use of paracetamol in the 3åÊmonths prior to the study; the highest proportion was found among those aged 18 to 25åÊyears (75.8%). Nine in 10 were over-the-counter (otc) paracetamol users. A total of 14.2% thought paracetamol is completely harmless to use while 54.3% indicated risks associated with use even when following the dosing instructions. One third disagreed that it is less risky to use paracetamol compared with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Three-quarters identified liver damage as a potential consequence of exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose. The likelihood of a high-risk perception was higher in women compared with men, and increased with age. No association was found between risk perception and educational status. Participants aged 18 to 25åÊyears had the same ability to identify risks of overdose as did those aged 26 to 65, but expressed more careless attitudes towards use. Although the study population purchased paracetamol primarily otc, they demonstrated basic awareness of paracetamol use including the potential consequences of overdosing.

Data from registries are a cornerstone of post-marketing surveillance for monitoring the use of medicines in clinical practice. This study was aimed at gaining further insight into the european medicines agency's (ema) requests for new registries and registry studies using existing registries and to review the experience gained in their conduct. European public assessment reports were consulted to identify products for which a request for a registry was made as a condition of the marketing authorisation. All centrally authorised products that received a positive opinion of the ema committee for medicinal products for human use between 1 january 2005 and 31 december 2013 were included. Data regarding registry design and experiences were collected from ema electronic record keeping systems. Of 392 products that received a positive committee for medicinal products for human use opinion during 2005-2013, 31 registries were requested for 30 products in total. Sixty-five percent were product registries whereas 35% were disease registries and 71% of the registries had a primary safety objective. Most commonly reported issues with registries were delayed time to start and low patient accrual rates. The delays found in getting new registries up and running support the need to improve the timeliness of data collection in the post-marketing setting. Methodological challenges met in conducting this study highlighted the need for a clarification of definitions and epidemiological concepts around patient registries.

August 2011 to august 2015. Two definitions were used to estimate potential off-label use: a broad definition of on-label prescribing using codes for disease indication (eg, atrial fibrillation [af]), and a restrictive definition excluding patients with conditions for which dabigatran is not indicated (eg, valvular af). Prevalence estimates under the broad definition ranged from 5.7% (cprd-hes) to 34.0% (csd-lpd) and, under the restrictive definition, from 17.4% (cprd-hes) to 44.1% (csd-lpd). For the majority of potential off-label users, no diagnosis potentially related to anticoagulant use was identified. Key methodological challenges were the limited availability of detailed clinical information, likely leading to overestimation of off-label use, and differences in the information available, which may explain the disparate prevalence estimates across data sources. Estimates of potential off-label use should be interpreted cautiously due to limitations in available information. In this context, cprd hes-linkable estimates are likely to be the most accurate.",29570897

Cox regression was performed to estimate the hazard ratios (hrs) of epilepsy after adjusting for parental and children factors. To evaluate confounding by indication, we extended the exposure time window from 2åÊyears before pregnancy and stratified the analyses by maternal asthma, in particular analyses by trimesters. The exposed children had a 1.24-fold risk of epilepsy (hråÊ=åÊ1.24, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.12, 1.38).

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of concomitant use of ccbs and clopidogrel on risks of acute coronary syndrome (acs) re-hospitalization in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention. Using the taiwan national health insurance research database, we identified 51‰Ûä925 patients who were admitted for newly diagnosed acs, received percutaneous coronary intervention, and used clopidogrel within 1‰Ûäyear after discharge. We further stratified them into three groups based on their uses of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications for acs (fully, partially, and non-compliant groups) to assess the potential modification effect of guideline compliance. For each group, we conducted a 1:1 propensity score matching to minimize selection bias. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the effect of concomitant use of ccbs (overall, subclasses, and individual ccbs) and clopidogrel on risks of acs re-hospitalization. Concomitant use of ccbs in patients discharged with clopidogrel was significantly associated with a lower risk of acs re-hospitalization in the fully compliant group (hr  ‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.82 [95% confidence interval 0.75-0.89], p‰Ûä<‰Ûä0.001) but was associated with increased risk of acs re-hospitalization in the non-compliant group (hr  ‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.22 [1.03-1.45], p‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.0252). Different guideline compliance of secondary prevention medications could modify the potential drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and ccbs. Concomitant use of ccbs and clopidogrel was significantly associated with increased risk of acs re-hospitalization in acs patients not compliant to guideline-recommended secondary prevention drugs.

The net prevalence of harms in the 18-64‰Ûäyears group was approximately four times smaller compared to the older group with a mean prevalence of 2.7% (95% confidence interval [ci]:2.4%-3.0%) and 10.2% (95%ci: 9.7%-10.7%) respectively. The potential preventability was 25.1% (18.4%-31.8%) and 48.3% (95%ci: 44.8%-51.8%), respectively. The prevalence of harms in both groups did not change significantly between 2008 and 2013 with 2.4% (95%ci: 1.9%-3.0%) and 10.0% (95%ci: 9.0%-11.0%) in 2008 and 3.1% (2.7%-3.5%) and 10.4% (95%ci: 9.4%-11.4%) in 2013, respectively. Despite efforts to reduce harms, the prevalence did not decrease over time. Additional measures are therefore necessary, especially in the elderly population.",33051958

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the us medicare claims research database (2006-2015) in adults aged ‰ä´65‰Ûäyears with pd claims. Other apd initiators were randomly matched (4:1) to rasagiline initiators on age, sex, and cohort entry year. Cutaneous melanoma events were identified by a validated claims algorithm. Incidence rates (irs), incidence rate ratios (irrs), and cox-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) for melanoma comparing rasagiline with other apd initiators were calculated and analyzed by duration of study medication use and cumulative dose of rasagiline. Potential indicators of surveillance bias were explored. Among 23‰Ûä708 rasagiline initiators and 96‰Ûä552 matched apd initiators, the crude ir of melanoma/100‰Ûä000 person-years was 334.3 (95% confidence interval [ci], 291.5-381.6) and 208.2 (95% ci, 190.1-227.5), respectively (crude irr 1.61; 95% ci, 1.36-1.89). The adjusted hr was 1.37 (95% ci, 1.14-1.65) and increased with longer rasagiline exposure and higher cumulative rasagiline doses. Rasagiline initiators more frequently had dermatologist visits or skin biopsies before cohort entry than apd initiators and had a higher incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer during follow-up (crude irr, 1.44; 95% ci, 1.35-1.54). A small increased incidence of melanoma with exposure to rasagiline compared with other apds was observed. Although the pattern with dose and duration is consistent with a hypothesized biologic effect, the increased skin cancer surveillance among rasagiline users suggests surveillance bias as a contributing explanation for the observed results.",35224798

We surveyed older hospital patients about use of sleep-inducing drugs before, during, and after hospitalization and compared these answers with their hospital chart using the kappa statistic. The association between the wish to continue these drugs after discharge and the perceived benefits, experience of side effects, and prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs was determined by multivariable logistic regression. Agreement between patient responses and the hospital file was high (ë_‰Ûä=‰Ûä0.7). Seventeen percent (83/483) of the participants reported prior experience before their hospital stay; 45% received a sleep-inducing drug during hospitalization; 17% wished to continue taking them after discharge. Of the 400 patients who had no prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs, 147 (37%) became first-time users in the hospital, and 27% (40/147) of these wished to continue this medication after discharged. Strong predictors for this wish were the reduction of sleep onset problems (adjusted odds ratio, 6.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.38-16.44) and any prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs (4.08; 1.97-8.48). Many older patients become first-time users of sleep-inducing drugs in the hospital. Especially the experience of sleep onset improvements influences the wish to continue sleep-inducing drug use after discharge. Avoiding first-time use should become a goal of hospital policy and be taken into account when weighing the benefits and risks of sleep-inducing drugs.",31179613

We iteratively developed and evaluated an algorithm for electronically identifying inpatient overdose/oversedation in kpnw hospitals from 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2014. Chart audits assessed accuracy; data sources included administrative and clinical records. The best-performing algorithm used these rules: (1) include events with opioids administered in an inpatient setting (including emergency department/urgent care) followed by naloxone administration within 275åÊhours of continuous inpatient stay; (2) exclude events with electroconvulsive therapy procedure codes; and (3) exclude events in which an opioid was administered prior to hospital discharge and followed by readmission with subsequent naloxone administration. Using this algorithm, we identified 870 suspect inpatient overdose/oversedation events and chart audited a random sample of 235. Of the random sample, 185 (78.7%) were deemed overdoses/oversedation, 37 (15.5%) were not, and 13 (5.5%) were possible cases. The number of hours between time of opioid and naloxone administration did not affect algorithm accuracy. When ""possible"" overdoses/oversedations were included with confirmed events, overall positive predictive value (ppv) was very good (ppvåÊ=åÊ84.0%).

Individuals born preterm used more specific medications at age 30 than those born at term. The risks of being dispensed psychotropic medications overall and the subgroups antiepileptics, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics were elevated in individuals born preterm. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, the risk was elevated in males born extremely preterm (rr 5.8; 95%ci: 2.2-15). The risk of being dispensed antiasthmatics increased by shorter gestational ages.

Steroids (14.49%), antineoplastic drugs (13.06%), anticoagulants (11.33%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (8.78%), and opiates/narcotics (6.48%) were the five most common causes of ade. Patient with ade stayed 1.89åÊdays [95% confidence interval (ci) (1.79-1.99); påÊ<åÊ0.001] longer, incurred $1851.44 [95%ci ($1613.90-$2088.96), påÊ<åÊ0.001] higher with higher odds of mortality 1.27 [95%ci (1.24-1.29), påÊ<åÊ0.001]. Adverse drug event carries a significant burden of inpatient hospital care, incurs more cost, and leads to increased loss of life. Targeted policies to reduce them could potentially help decrease mortality as well as drive down cost. Copyright å© 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28233421

The aim of this study was to compare bias and efficiency of such a one-stage meta-analysis with a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we compared the approaches by generating matched case-control data under 5 simulated scenarios, built by varying: (1) the exposure-outcome association; (2) its variability among databases; (3) the confounding strength of one covariate on this association; (4) its variability; and (5) the (heterogeneous) confounding strength of two covariates. Second, we made the same comparison using empirical data from the aritmo project, a multiple database study investigating the risk of ventricular arrhythmia following the use of medications with arrhythmogenic potential. In our study, we specifically investigated the effect of current use of promethazine. Bias increased for one-stage meta-analysis with increasing (1) between-database variance of exposure effect and (2) heterogeneous confounding generated by two covariates. The efficiency of one-stage meta-analysis was slightly lower than that of two-stage meta-analysis for the majority of investigated scenarios. Based on aritmo data, there were no evident differences between one-stage (oråÊ=åÊ1.50, ciåÊ=åÊ[1.08; 2.08]) and two-stage (oråÊ=åÊ1.55, ciåÊ=åÊ[1.12; 2.16]) approaches. When the effect of interest is heterogeneous, a one-stage meta-analysis ignoring clustering gives biased estimates. Two-stage meta-analysis generates estimates at least as accurate and precise as one-stage meta-analysis. However, in a study using small databases and rare exposures and/or outcomes, a correct one-stage meta-analysis becomes essential.",28799196

From 2000 to 2018, us poison control centers recorded 549‰Ûä807 suicide-related cases involving otc analgesics, including 327‰Ûä781 cases (59.6%) admitted to the hospital and 1745 deaths (0.3%). Most cases involved a single substance (67.5%) and occurred among females (72.7%) and individuals 6-19‰Ûäyears old (49.7%). Overall, the rate of exposures increased significantly by 33.5% from 2000 to 2018, primarily driven by the increasing exposure rate among 6- to 19-year-old females. From 2000 to 2018, exposure rates for acetaminophen and ibuprofen increased, while that for acetylsalicylic acid decreased. Additionally, the proportion of cases resulting in a serious medical outcome or healthcare facility admission increased for all types of otc analgesics. Acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid accounted for 48.0% and 18.5% of cases, respectively, and 64.5% and 32.6% of deaths, respectively. Both acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid had greater odds of healthcare facility admission (ors 2.56 and 2.63, respectively) and serious medical outcomes (ors 2.54 and 4.90, respectively) compared with ibuprofen. The rate of suicide-related otc analgesic cases is increasing. Acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid cases are associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Prevention efforts should include implementing unit-dose packaging requirements and restrictions on package sizes and purchase quantities for acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid products to reduce access to large quantities of these analgesics.",32715560

We examined trends in the number of patients with ad visits, the number of ad visits per patient, and visits with ""competing"" diagnoses (mental, neurological, and cerebrovascular disorders and accidental falls). Finally, we described demographic and clinical features of diagnosed patients. We analyzed 1.9 million ad visits.

In addition, it is unknown what proportion of prescription analgesics is approved for use in children and what proportion is used ""off-label."" nationally representative data from 52 tertiary care children's hospitals in the pediatric health information system were queried to determine prescribing rates of analgesic medications. We analyzed hospitalizations for children <18‰Ûäyears occurring between 1 april 2010 and 30 june 2018. Food and drug administration (fda) drug labels were reviewed for pediatric information, and prescriptions were classified as on- or off-label based on age, route, and formulation. Among 4.9 million hospitalizations, 1.8 million (37.6%, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 37.6-37.7) were associated with use of a prescription analgesic.

Off-label analgesic use was higher among hospitalizations in the intensive care unit (61.5%) or with an operating room procedure (92.8%). Rates of off-label prescribing increased with age, peaking at 50.5% for adolescents. Prescription analgesics administered most frequently were morphine, fentanyl, and ketorolac, with off-label use occurring in 24.5%, 23.1%, and 11.3% of hospitalizations, respectively. Over a third of pediatric hospitalizations were associated with the administration of prescription analgesics that have not been labeled for use in children.

We conducted a population-based, serial cross-sectional study of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing from community pharmacies across canada between october 2007 and april 2016. We calculated rates of dispensing (tablets per 100 population) and reported the relative market share of generic non-tamper-deterrent controlled-release oxycodone. All analyses were reported nationally and stratified by province. After the introduction of a tamper-deterrent formulation, the national rate of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing fell by 44.6% (from 26.4 to 14.6 tablets per 100 population from february 2012 to april 2016). Between december 2012 and july 2013, there was moderate uptake of generic non-tamper-deterrent controlled-release oxycodone (968åÊ452 tablets; 16.0% in july 2013), which appeared to have little impact on the overall rate of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing in canada.

A further objective was to compare differences in incriminated drugs and characteristics between validated cases and a reference excluding anaphylactic reaction cases (basic dataset). Spontaneous reports of anaphylactic reactions in children (0-17åÊyears) registered between january 2000 to december 2016 were extracted from the adverse drug reaction database of the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices. These reports were restricted to drugs for which at least four cases were found. After case validation, 159 reports remained (validated dataset) and were compared with the basic dataset (nåÊ=åÊ12.168 reports) using inferential statistics. Estimated yearly increase of reports (36.8 vs 0.1), most frequently incriminated drugs (antibiotics 30.2% vs 11%, analgesics/antipyretics 22.0% vs 5.6%; p values less than 0.001) and route of administration (38.4% vs 6.7%) differed between the validated dataset and the basic dataset. Validated cases differed in severity (higher with atracurium), reported symptoms (urticaria leading with analgesics), and associated factors (atopy/allergy rarely reported with antibiotics) depending on the incriminated drug class. In 13.8% (11.3% if excluding repeated readministration in one person) of the cases, the drug had not been tolerated before.

We aimed to evaluate the extent and magnitude of bias in case-crossover analyses of chronic and persistent exposures, using simulations. We simulated cohorts with either 30-day, 180-day, or 2-year exposure duration; and with varying degrees of persistence (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 90% of patients not stopping exposure). We evaluated all scenarios under the null and the scenario with 30% persistence under varying exposure effects (odds ratios of 0.25 to 4.0). Cohorts were analyzed using conditional logistic regression that compared the odds of exposure on the outcome day to the odds of exposure on a referent day 30‰Ûädays prior to the outcome. We further implemented the case-time-control design to evaluate its ability to adjust for bias from persistence. Case-crossover analyses produced unbiased estimates across all scenarios without persistent users, regardless of exposure duration. In scenarios where some patients persisted on treatment, case-crossover analyses resulted in upward bias, which increased with increasing proportion of persistent users, but did not vary substantially in relation to the magnitude of the true effect. Case-time-control analyses removed bias in all scenarios. Investigators should be aware of bias due to treatment persistence in unidirectional case-crossover analyses of chronic medications, which can be remedied with a control group of similarly persistent noncases.",32548875

The aim of this literature review is to provide an overview of criteria used for signal prioritization and of the associated decision support frameworks. A search strategy was constructed to identify relevant articles in medline/embase databases from the period from 1 january 1995 to 31 august 2015. The prioritization criteria were extracted and classified in relevant categories. From an initial set of 63 articles, 11 were retained for full review. The articles mentioned 48 criteria used in the prioritization process, with a median of six criteria per study [range: 1-16]. More than half of the criteria (63%), referred to strength of evidence while 19% related to public health impact, 14% to general public and media attention and 4% to novelty of the drug event association. Fifteen criteria were tested for predictive value with 11 showing positive results, most of them from the strength of evidence category. Six decision-making frameworks are presented, which incorporate criteria from various categories. Five of these frameworks were tested against expert decisions or by other means, but only in one database each and for a limited set of products. There is a wide range of prioritization criteria described in the literature; however, few of them demonstrated predictive value. Many criteria with predictive value were related to strength of evidence category and to novelty. There were few attempts at integrating different criteria in decision support frameworks. Five of the frameworks were tested for validity and showed usefulness, while at least three are already in use for prioritization. Copyright å© 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27878889

Nested case-control analyses were conducted on a quebec administrative health cohort. Nsaid dose, confounders, and outcome status were determined for each day of follow-up. To better account for dose and timing of past exposures, flexible weighted cumulative exposure models were also fitted. The cohort consisted of 233 816 older adults including 21 256 acute mi cases. Dose-related increased risks of mi were found with current use of all nsaids. In models not accounting for duration of use, ors (95%ci) for the most common current daily dose vs. No current exposure were: celecoxib 200åÊmg: 1.16 (1.10, 1.22), diclofenac 150åÊmg: 1.59 (1.38, 1.84), ibuprofen 1200åÊmg: 1.42 (1.17, 1.74), naproxen 750åÊmg: 1.38 (1.21, 1.58), and rofecoxib 25åÊmg: 1.54 (1.43, 1.66).

However, the celecoxib risk seems to require continuous use for more than 30åÊdays, whereas for other nsaids, a heightened mi risk occurs within 7åÊdays. Weighted cumulative exposure analysis uncovered nsaid-specific differences in the immediate mi risk and how this risk seems to accumulate. Key points accurate assessment of drug safety requires an etiologically correct model encompassing all relevant aspects of exposure. Weighted cumulative exposure models suggest that the relative importance of past doses on the risk of mi differs among nsaids. All common nsaids are associated with an increased mi risk. Celecoxib mi risk seems to depend on continuously using the drug for more than 30åÊdays, whereas for ibuprofen, rofecoxib, diclofenac, and naproxen, a heightened mi risk occurs within 7åÊdays of use.",29171096

To assess how the revised code fits the ecosystem of noninterventional pharmacoepidemiology research in europe, we first mapped key recommendations of the revised code against ispe good pharmacoepidemiology practices and the advance code of conduct. We surveyed stakeholders to understand perceptions on its value and practical applicability. Representatives from the different stakeholders' groups described their experience and expectations. Unmet needs in pharmacoepidemiological research are fulfilled by providing unique guidance on roles and responsibilities to support scientific independence. The principles of scientific independence and transparency are well understood and reinforce trust in study results; however, around 70% of survey respondents still found some provisions difficult to apply. Representatives from stakeholders' groups found the new version promising, although limitations still exist. By clarifying definitions and roles, the latest revision of the code sets a new standard in the relationship between investigators and funders to support scientific independence of pharmacoepidemiological research. Disseminating and training on the provisions of the code would help stakeholders to better understand its advantages and promote its adoption in noninterventional research.",30838708

Despite the existence of quantitative bias analysis in pharmacoepidemiologic studies, simultaneously adjusting for unmeasured and partially measured confounders is challenging in vaccine safety studies. Our objective was to develop a flexible approach for conducting sensitivity analyses of unmeasured and partially-measured confounders concurrently for a vaccine safety study. We derived conditional probabilities for an unmeasured confounder based on bias parameters, used these conditional probabilities and monte carlo simulations to impute the unmeasured confounder, and re-constructed the analytic datasets as if the unmeasured confounder had been observed. We simultaneously imputed a partially measured confounder using a prediction model. We considered unmeasured breastfeeding and partially measured family history of type 1 diabetes (t1dm) in a study examining the association between exposure to rotavirus vaccination and t1dm. Before sensitivity analyses, the hazard ratios (hr) were 1.50 (95% ci, 0.81-2.77) for those partially exposed and 1.03 (95% ci, 0.62-1.72) for those fully exposed with unexposed children as the referent group. When breastfeeding and family history of t1dm were adjusted, the hr was 1.55 (95% ci, 0.84-2.87) for the partially exposed group; the hr was 0.98 (95% ci, 0.58-1.63) for the fully exposed group. We conclude that adjusting for unmeasured breastfeeding and partially measured family history of t1dm did not alter the conclusion that there was no evidence of association between rotavirus vaccination and developing t1dm. This novel approach allows for simultaneous adjustment for multiple unmeasured and partially-measured confounders.",33988275

Recent data suggest that transdermal fentanyl and oxycodone cr may have greater toxicity than morphine sr in patients with non-cancer pain. Thus, we compared the risk of out-of-hospital deaths in patients with non-cancer pain filling prescriptions for transdermal fentanyl or oxycodone cr with that for morphine sr. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 50åÊ658 patients enrolled in tennessee medicaid who filled prescriptions for transdermal fentanyl (nåÊ=åÊ8717), oxycodone cr (nåÊ=åÊ14åÊ118), or morphine sr (nåÊ=åÊ27åÊ823) between 1999 and 2011. We excluded individuals with cancer or other life-threatening diagnoses and used propensity scores to adjust for multiple potential confounders. The primary outcome was out-of-hospital mortality. During 44åÊ385 person-years of follow-up, 689 patients died. The out-of-hospital mortality rate among all study subjects was 155/10åÊ000 patient-years. Contrary to earlier data suggesting greater risk, mortality was not significantly different in patients filling prescriptions for transdermal fentanyl compared with morphine sr (adjusted hråÊ=åÊ0.96, 95% c.i.: 0.77-1.21); moreover, patients filling prescriptions for oxycodone cr had lower mortality risk compared with those filling prescriptions for morphine sr (adjusted hråÊ=åÊ0.79, 95% c.i. 0.66-0.95). In the study population, long-acting opioids for non-cancer pain were associated with high out-of-hospital mortality rates. We found comparable out-of-hospital mortality risks associated with transdermal fentanyl and morphine sr. The risk of out-of-hospital death for oxycodone cr was lower than that for morphine sr.",30003613

Aims of this study were to update, validate, and refine algorithms for identifying selected bds, and then to use these algorithms to describe bd prevalence in the vaccine safety datalink (vsd) population. We converted our icd-9-cm list of selected bds to icd-10-cm using available crosswalks with manual review of codes. We identified, chart reviewed, and adjudicated a sample of infants in the vsd with ‰ä´2 icd-10-cm diagnoses for one of seven common bds. Positive predictive values (ppvs) were calculated; for bds with suboptimal ppv, algorithms were refined. Final automated algorithms were applied to a cohort of live births delivered 10/1/2015-9/30/2017 at eight vsd sites to estimate bd prevalence. This research was approved by the healthpartners institutional review board, by all participating vsd sites, and by the cdc, with a waiver of informed consent.

We drew data on patients with ms followed from 1977 to 2014 in montrÌ©al using two sub-cohorts of subjects. A sub-cohort of patients taking interferon-beta-1a and another of patients taking amitriptyline were identified from the initial cohort. We use gbtm to identify groups of patients with homogeneous dose patterns for each of the two drugs. We compared the graphical representation obtained from the fitted values of gbtm with our proposed approach, which consisted of using step functions whose values corresponded to the mode. Differences in characteristics across groups were identified using chi-squares and analysis of variance, both weighted by the posterior probability of group membership. Seven patterns of dose were identified for interferon-beta-1a and five for amitriptyline. The graphical representations of the patterns of dose from gbtm included values outside of the prescribed doses and did not capture changes in dose as clearly as the proposed representation using step functions.

The overall aim of activities in this area is to assess the performance of risk minimization measures implemented in order to ensure a positive benefit-risk balance in patients treated with a medicinal product. Following a review of the relevant literature, we developed a conceptual framework consisting of four domains (data, knowledge, behaviour and outcomes) intended for the evaluation of risk minimization measures put into practice in the danish health-care system. For the implementation of the framework, four classes of monitoring variables can be named and defined: patient descriptors, performance-related indicators of knowledge, behaviour and outcomes. We reviewed the features of the framework when applied to historical, real-world data following the introduction of dabigatran in denmark for the prophylactic treatment of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The application of the framework provided useful graphical displays and an opportunity for a statistical evaluation (interrupted time series analysis) of a regulatory intervention. å© 2017 commonwealth of australia.

Findings that prenatal nsaid exposure may affect offspring neurodevelopment have been inconsistent. We investigated the effect of prenatal nsaid exposure on childhood neurodevelopment and explored the susceptibility of our effect estimates to forms of bias via negative exposure, negative outcome, and multi-informant analyses. In a cohort of pregnant women (nåÊ=åÊ6876), perinatal nsaid use was assessed by prescriptions and self-report. Primary neurodevelopmental outcomes included attention problems using maternal reports at 1å_, 3, and 5åÊyears. To explore potential systematic biases, we compared estimates from maternally reported attention problems to a teacher's report and a measure of nonverbal intelligence assessed at a clinic visit at age 6åÊyears; we also used nsaid use before pregnancy and somatic problems as a ""negative"" exposure and outcome, respectively. Maternal reports suggested that prenatal exposure to nsaids was associated with more attention problems at younger ages (eg, at age 3: mean difference in attention problems score: 0.30; 95% ci 0.12, 0.48). However, no strong association with attention problems was found in the teacher report, and a similarly strong association between prenatal nsaid exposure and somatic complaints suggests residual confounding by indication likely remains. Moreover, prenatal exposure to nsaids was not associated with an observed measure of iq (mean difference in iq score: -0.32; 95% ci: -1.82, 1.19). Jointly, our results suggest that the observed associations between prenatal exposure to nsaids and child attention problems reflect systematic biases of a null or small effect.",30838712

In this tutorial, we review the steps used in iv analyses and the underlying assumptions. We also present methods to assess the validity of those assumptions and describe sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of possible violations of those assumptions. Observational studies based on regression or propensity score analyses rely on the untestable assumption that there are no unmeasured confounders. Iv analysis is a tool that removes the bias caused by unmeasured confounding provided that key assumptions (some of which are also untestable) are met. When instruments are valid, iv methods provided unbiased treatment effect estimation in the presence of unmeasured confounders. However, the standard error of the iv estimate is higher than the standard error of non-iv estimates, e.g., regression and propensity score methods. Sensitivity analyses provided insight about the robustness of the iv results to the plausible degrees of violation of assumptions. Iv analysis should be used cautiously because the validity of iv estimates relies on assumptions that are, in general, untestable and difficult to be certain about. Thus, assessing the sensitivity of the estimate to violations of these assumptions is important and can better inform the causal inferences that can be drawn from the study.

Of patients with myocardial infarction who were also prescribed methylphenidate within the observation period, methylphenidate use was classified into four mutually exclusive periods by each person-day: exposed (exposed to methylphenidate), pre-exposure (prior to the first methylphenidate prescription), washout (after the end of methylphenidate treatment), and baseline (unexposed to methylphenidate). Risk of myocardial infarction among the three periods of methylphenidate use was compared to the baseline period using conditional poisson regression analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (irrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis). We identified 2104, 484, and 30 patients from south korea, taiwan, and hong kong, respectively. Risk of myocardial infarction was the highest during the pre-exposure period in all three populations: south korea, pre-exposure (irr 3.17, 95% ci 3.04-3.32), exposed (1.05, 1.00-1.11), washout (1.92, 1.80-2.04); taiwan, pre-exposure (1.97, 1.78-2.17), exposed (0.72, 0.65-0.80), washout (0.56, 0.46-0.68); hong kong, pre-exposure (18.09, 8.19-39.96), exposed (9.32, 3.44-25.28), washout (7.69, 1.72-34.41). Following stratification for age and sex, the trends remained analogous to the main findings across all three populations. Although a positive association between initiating methylphenidate and the onset of myocardial infarction was observed, the risk was the highest in the period before its initiation. Thus, this multinational study suggests there was no causal relationship between methylphenidate and myocardial infarction among asians.",34216049

For researchers, nepis have the potential to advance our understanding of the risks and benefits of medications in populations; however, due to their unstructured nature, they are not often utilized. The goal of this scoping review was to evaluate how nepis are currently employed in research, identify opportunities and challenges for their broader application, and provide recommendations on their future use. The scoping review comprised a comprehensive literature review and a survey of key stakeholders. From the literature review, we identified 33 primary articles that described the use of nepis. The majority of articles (nåÊ=‰Ûä19) identified issues with the quality of information in nepis compared with structured prescribing information; nine articles described the development of novel algorithms that performed well in extracting information from nepis, and five described the used of manual or simpler algorithms to extract prescribing information from nepis. A survey of 19 stakeholders indicated concerns for the quality of information in nepis and called for standardization of nepis to reduce data variability/errors. Nevertheless, stakeholders believed nepis present an opportunity to identify prescriber's intent for the prescription and to study temporal treatment patterns. In summary, nepis hold much promise for advancing the field of pharmacoepidemiology. Researchers should take advantage of addressing important questions that can be uniquely answered with nepis, but exercise caution when using this information and carefully consider the quality of the data.",34278660

Studies have shown that the doubly robust estimator is subject to more bias than the standard weighting estimator when both ps and outcome models are incorrectly specified. We evaluated whether various machine learning methods can be used for estimating conditional means of the potential outcomes to enhance the robustness of the doubly robust estimator to various degrees of model misspecification in terms of reducing bias and standard error. We considered four types of methods to predict the outcomes: least squares, tree-based methods, generalized additive models and shrinkage methods. We also considered an ensemble method called the super learner (sl), which is a linear combination of multiple learners. We conducted simulations considering different scenarios by the complexity of ps and outcome-generating models and some ranges of treatment prevalence. The shrinkage methods performed well with robust doubly robust estimates in term of bias and mean squared error across the scenarios when the models became rich by including all 2-way interactions of the covariates.

The primary outcome was overall survival (os); secondary outcomes comprised progression-free survival (pfs), overall response rate (orr) and the occurrence of adverse events (ae). For all survival analyses, the kaplan-meier estimator was used, considering a 95% confidence interval (ci), aside with one-year survival rates. A total of 125 patients constituted the cohort, originating from 16 hospitals in portugal. Median os was estimated to be 16.9 months (ci  11.3-25.5) and the probability of survival after 1‰Ûäyear was 57.5% (ci  48.4%-65.6%). Median pfs was estimated to be 4.8 months (ci  3.9-6.7) and the probability of remaining progression-free after 1‰Ûäyear was 32.8% (ci  24.8-41.1). Orr was 30.4% (ci  22.5%-39.3%).

The iraes were defined using the preferred terms of the medical dictionary for regulatory activities. Iraes were categorized as follows: adrenal insufficiency, colitis, eye diseases, hematological disorder, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, nephritis/renal dysfunction, pneumonitis, rash, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. We used several indices such as reporting odds ratio (ror) to assess disproportionality in pharmacovigilance data, time-to-onset analysis using weibull shape parameters, and the association rule mining technique to evaluate possible risk factors between variables in the spontaneous reporting system database. The jader database contained 534‰Ûä688 reports from april 2004 to june 2018. The rors of pneumonitis including interstitial lung disease for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab were 7.02 (95% confidence interval: 6.55-7.52), 9.08 (8.28-9.97), and 1.74 (1.27-2.38), respectively.

Co-therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab may be associated with iraes in several categories as per the association rule mining analysis. Our results demonstrated a potential risk of iraes associated with icis, based on rors and time-to-onset analysis. Furthermore, our findings indicated that patients receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab as co-therapy should be carefully monitored.",32869941

To generate real-world evidence on comparative safety and effectiveness of these drugs, a claims-based algorithm that can accurately identify psa is greatly needed. To identify patients with psa, we developed seven claims-based algorithms based on a combination of diagnosis codes and medication dispensing using the claims data from medicare parts a/b/d linked to electronic medical records (2012-2014). Two physicians independently conducted a chart review using the treating physician's diagnosis of psa as the gold standard. We calculated the positive predictive value (ppv) and 95% confidence intervals of each algorithm. Of the total 2157 records identified by the seven algorithms, 45% of the records had relevant clinical data to determine the presence of psa. The ppv of the algorithms ranged from 75.2% (algorithm 1: ‰ä´2 diagnosis codes for psa and ‰ä´1 diagnosis code for psoriasis) to 88.6% (algorithm 7: ‰ä´2 diagnosis codes for psa with ‰ä´1 code by rheumatologist and ‰ä´1 dispensing for psa medication).

Warfarin is still used as a first-line anticoagulant, although non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants are currently recommended to manage af. Using a large, unselected national sample of af patients, we evaluated the relationships between quality of warfarin therapy and the risks of thromboembolism, bleeding complications, and mortality. The nationwide finwaf study included 54åÊ568 af patients taking warfarin. Time in the therapeutic range (ttr) was calculated on a continuous basis using the rosendaal method and international normalized ratio values over the previous 60åÊdays. Adjusted cox proportional hazard models were prepared for different ttr levels and major clinical end points. The mean age of patients was 73.1åÊyears (standard deviation 10.8), and 47% were female. The mean follow-up time was 3.2åÊå±åÊ1.6åÊyears (median 3.4).

The incident rate of second relapse (r2-rate) was extended to the population without pa reports. Nhl incident patients were 7384, 68% presented a pa report and, 29% of these had dlbcl codes. Patients who relapsed after two treatment lines were 47 (39%) in the subgroup of patients who received asct and 138 (41%) in that with second chemotherapy treatment. Patients in the two subgroups were very different in terms of age and comorbidity. The annual incident number of dlbcl was estimated to be 329 which multiplied by r2-rate (13.7%) gives 45 patients per year eligible for car-t.

We described patient-level factors (eg, demographics, healthcare use) associated with high (>2) vs low (0 <‰Ûädbi‰ä_1) dbi drug exposure. The distribution of the mean daily dbi, aggregated at the month-level, was: 58.1% dbi = 0, 29.0% 0 <‰Ûädbi‰ä_1, 9.3% 1 <‰Ûädbi‰ä_2, and 3.7% dbi‰Ûä>‰Ûä2. Predictors of high monthly dbi drug exposure (dbi‰Ûä>‰Ûä2) included certain indicators of increased healthcare use (eg, high number of drug claims), white race, younger age, frailty, and a psychosis diagnosis code. The predictors of high dbi drug exposure can inform discussions between patients and providers about medication appropriateness and potential de-prescribing. Future medicare-based studies should assess the association between the dbi and adverse events.",33000867

The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of classifying medication exposure using ehr prescribing (ehr-rx) data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with linked claims and ehr data in optumlabs‰ã¢ data warehouse. The agreement between ehr-rx data and pharmacy claims (pc-rx) data (for 40 medications) was determined using the positive predictive value (ppv) and medication possession ratio (mpr)-calculated in 1- and 12-month medication exposure periods (meps). Secondary analyses were restricted to incident vs prevalent ehr-rxs, age ‰ä´65 vs <65, white vs black race, males vs females, and number of ehr-rxs. The validity metrics varied substantially among the 40 medications assessed. Across all medications, the period ppv and mpr were 62% and 63% in the 1-month mep. They were 78% and 43% in the 12-month mep. Overall, ppv and mpr were higher for patients with a prevalent ehr-rx and age <65. Despite substantial variability among different medications, there was very good agreement between ehr-rx data and pc-rx data. To maximize the validity of classifying medication exposure with ehr prescribing data, researchers may consider using longer meps (eg, 12åÊmonths) and potentially require multiple ehr-rxs to classify baseline medication exposure.",28608510

A monte carlo simulation study.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4325,"As covariates are not always adequately balanced after propensity score matching and double- adjustment can be used to remove residual confounding, we compared the performance of several double-robust estimators in different scenarios. We conducted a series of monte carlo simulations on virtual observational studies. After estimating the propensity scores by logistic regression, we performed 1:1 optimal, nearest-neighbor, and caliper matching. We used 4 estimators on each matched sample: (1) a crude estimator without double-adjustment, (2) double-adjustment for the propensity scores, (3) double-adjustment for the unweighted unbalanced covariates, and (4) double-adjustment for the unbalanced covariates, weighted by their strength of association with the outcome. The crude estimator led to highest bias in all tested scenarios. Double-adjustment for the propensity scores effectively removed confounding only when the propensity score models were correctly specified. Double-adjustment for the unbalanced covariates was more robust to misspecification. Double-adjustment for the weighted unbalanced covariates outperformed the other approaches in every scenario and using any matching algorithm, as measured by the mean squared error. Double-adjustment can be used to remove residual confounding after propensity score matching. The unbalanced covariates with the strongest confounding effects should be adjusted.",28984050

Adverse events are preferred terms (pts) defined in meddra. We used frequentist approaches, including the reporting odds ratio (ror) and the proportional reporting ratio (prr) to measure disproportionality.

Although medication-induced delirium in older adults is well understood, limited population-level evidence is available, particularly on combinations of medications associated with delirium in older adults. We aimed to apply association rule analysis to identify drug combinations contributing to delirium risk in adults aged 65 and older using a case-time-control design. We sourced a nationwide representative sample of new zealander's aged ‰ä´65‰Ûäyears from the pharmaceutical collections and hospital discharge information. Prescription records (2005-2015) were obtained from new zealand pharmaceutical collections (pharms). Medication exposures were coded as binary variables (exposed vs. Not exposed) at the individual drug level. All medications, including antimicrobials, antihistamines, diuretics, opioids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, were considered drugs of interest. The first-time coded diagnosis of delirium was extracted from the national minimal dataset (nmds). A unique patient identifier linked the prescription dataset to the event dataset to set up a case-time-control cohort, indexed at the first delirium event. Association rules were then applied to identify frequent drug combinations in the case and the control periods (l-day with a 35-day washout period) that are statistically associated with delirium, and the association was tested by computing a time-trend adjusted matched odds-ratio (mor) and its 95% confidence interval (ci). We identified 28 503 individuals (mean age 84.1‰Ûäyears) from 2005 to 2015 with delirium. Our combined association rule and case-time-control analysis identified several drug classes, including antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, opioids, and diuretics associated with delirium. Our analysis also identified frequently used drug combinations that are associated with delirium. Examples include combined exposures to quetiapine and furosemide (moråÊ=åÊ6.17; 95%ciåÊ=åÊ[2.05-18.54]), haloperidol (moråÊ=åÊ4.81; 95%ciåÊ=åÊ[3.16-6.69]), combined exposures to furosemide, omeprazole, and lorazepam (moråÊ=åÊ3.94; 95%ciåÊ=åÊ[3.03-5.10]), and fentanyl exposure (moråÊ=åÊ3.46; 95%ci [2.05-9.21]).

Data were stratified into five age groups. Crude and adjusted (by age standardisation of prescribed drugs) reporting rate (rr) and reporting rate ratio was evaluated as well as impact of sex-dependent drugs. Based on 9898 included icsrs, the crude results show that overall rr was almost similar for both serious and non-serious reports and indicates highest rr in the youngest age group. Women had higher rates than men, with predominance for non-serious reports, contrary to men who had a higher rr of serious ones. Standardisation led partly to the same result, but age-related distribution was adjusted, with highest overall rr in the oldest age groups. Sex-dependent drugs had marginal impact on the results. Age and sex have impact on spontaneous reporting of adrs. After adjusting for dispensed drugs and by standardisation of age-related differences in prescribed drugs, results indicate that healthcare professionals more frequently reported adrs for the oldest individuals and for women. Serious reports were more frequently reported for men. Copyright å© 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28071845

The pubmed and embase databases were searched to identify potential studies for inclusion. Eight cohort studies that estimated adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes associated with exposure to adhd medication during pregnancy were included. Exposure to adhd medication was associated with an increased risk of neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) admission compared with no exposure at any time (risk ratio (rr) 1.88; 95% confidence interval (ci), 1.7-2.08) and compared with women with exposure either before or after pregnancy (rr 1.38; 95% ci, 1.23-1.54; påÊ<åÊ0.001).

While many analytical methods have been developed for dealing with this challenge, they appear under-utilized, perhaps due to the complexity and varied requirements for implementation. Thus, there is an unmet need to improve understanding the appropriate course of action to address unmeasured confounding under a variety of research scenarios. We implemented a stepwise search strategy to find articles discussing the assessment of unmeasured confounding in electronic literature databases. Identified publications were reviewed and characterized by the applicable research settings and information requirements required for implementing each method. We further used this information to develop a best practice recommendation to help guide the selection of appropriate analytical methods for assessing the potential impact of unmeasured confounding. Over 100 papers were reviewed, and 15 methods were identified. We used a flowchart to illustrate the best practice recommendation which was driven by 2 critical components: (1) availability of information on the unmeasured confounders; and (2) goals of the unmeasured confounding assessment. Key factors for implementation of each method were summarized in a checklist to provide further assistance to researchers for implementing these methods. When assessing comparative effectiveness or safety in observational research, the impact of unmeasured confounding should not be ignored. Instead, we suggest quantitatively evaluating the impact of unmeasured confounding and provided a best practice recommendation for selecting appropriate analytical methods.",29383840

This review synthesizes the current literature on medical device surveillance signal detection and provides a framework for application of methods to active surveillance of spontaneous reports. Ovid medline, ovid embase, scopus, and pubmed databases were systematically searched up to january 2019. Additionally, five methods articles from pharmacovigilance were added that had potential applications to medical devices. Among 105 articles included, the most common source of data (84%) was registries; median time between data collection and publication was 8‰Ûäyears. Surgical procedure outcome signal detection articles comprised 83% while 14% were on device outcome signal detection. The most common family of methods cited (70%) was sequential probability ratio. Application of any signal detection algorithm requires careful consideration of influential factors, data limitations, and algorithmic assumptions. We recommend approaches using disproportionality, statistical process control, and sequential probability tests and provide r packages to further development efforts. The small number of published examples suggest that further development of statistical methods and technological solutions to analyze large amounts of data for device safety and performance is needed.

Medicare beneficiaries age 66 or older with an office visit and at least 12åÊmonths of pre-visit continuous medicare a/b enrollment were identified in 2008. Five-year mortality was assessed through 2013. Secondary outcomes included 30-, 90-, and 180-day and 1-year mortality. Claims-based predictors, including comorbidities and indicators of disability, frailty, and functional impairment, were selected using regularized logistic regression, applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) in a random 80% training sample. Model performance was assessed and compared with the gagne comorbidity score in the 20% validation sample. Overall, 183åÊ204 (24%) individuals died. In addition to demographics, 161 indicators of comorbidity and function were included in the final model. In the validation sample, the c-statistic was 0.825 (0.823-0.828). Median-predicted probability of 5-year mortality was 14%; almost 4% of the cohort had a predicted probability greater than 80%.

The sample composed participants who were dispensed an antidepressant in the 30åÊdays prior to questionnaire completion (nåÊ=åÊ3162). An algorithm based on patient characteristics, pharmaceutical dispensings, and claims for mental health services was built using group-lasso interaction network (glinternet), with self-reported receipt of treatment for depression as the outcome. The predictive performance of the algorithm was assessed via bootstrap resampling. The algorithm composes 15 main effects and 11 interactions, with type of antidepressant dispensed and claims for mental health services the strongest predictors. The ability of the algorithm to discriminate between antidepressant users with and without depression was 0.73. At a predicted probability cut-off of 0.6, specificity was 93.8% and sensitivity was 23.6%.

Prescription data (containing information about prescriptions issued but no dispensing information) was provided by the clinical practice research datalink. The following variables were defined: current use and dose of oral gcs and if (and when) participants had received a gc injection. For oral gcs, self-reported use was taken to represent ""true"" exposure. A dataset representing a hypothetical population was generated to assess the impact of the misclassification found for current use. A total of 67 of 78 study participants (86%) were correctly classified as currently on/off oral gcs; 32/38 (84.2%) participants reporting current gc use and 35/40 (87.5%) participants not reporting current use were correctly classified. Estimated values of current dose were imprecise (correlation coefficient 0.46). Concordance between reported and prescribed gc injections was poor (kappa statistic 0.14).

A cohort of recently relapsed patients with schizophrenia ages 18 to 64, were identified immediately after discharge from a related inpatient hospitalization, partial hospitalization, or emergency room visit, drawn from 2004 to 2006 medicaid claims, and followed for 90åÊdays until lai initiation. Data on state-level medicaid prior authorization (pa) policies for lais were collected. Sequential longitudinal poisson regression models were developed to understand the relationship between patient and pa policy variables and lai prescribing, including prior adherence to oral antipsychotics, demographics, clinical variables, and presence of pa policy for lai. Among 36åÊ282 patients, 3.1% received risperidone lai, and 3.8% received a first-generation (fga) lai with wide variation across states. Prior adherence ranged from 29% to 89% but was marginally associated with initiation and did not explain variation for lai prescribing. Fga initiation was associated with geography and race/ethnicity but not pa policy. For risperidone lai initiation, demographics and clinical factors explained, respectively, 5.0% and 3.0% of the variation; pa policy had a large negative association with initiation (rråÊ=åÊ0.41; 95%ci 0.20-0.87) and explained 8.4% of the variation.

Outcome-specific cox proportional models evaluated the adjusted hazard ratios between disease activity and outcomes, controlling for potential confounders including comorbidities grouped into four patient phenotypes. Costs were analyzed with mixed models using a gaussian distribution with log transformation. Depending on outcome, 4593 ra patients contributed up to 12‰Ûä001 person years. Median age was 71‰Ûäyears, 75% women. At baseline, approximately 50-60% of patients were in remission or low disease activity.

Information component (ic) was the method used for disproportionality analysis. By using ic thresholds of various strengths (0.05-4.00), the original quantitative data matrix was transformed into 80 different binary data matrices, where each cell contained either a 1 or 0. The biclustering results were obtained using a total of 720 bimax algorithm parameters (minimal number of columns and rows was 3, 4, or 5). Next, the optimal parameters were determined through the comprehensive evaluation of the rank sum ration.

The primary aim of the present study was follow-up of neurocognitive development in children exposed to analgesic opioids during pregnancy, using three different validated instruments to assess language and communication development at 5‰Ûäyears. The norwegian mother and child cohort study (moba) prospectively included pregnant women 1999 to 2008. Participants reported medication use at pregnancy week 17/18 and 30, and 6 months after birth. Children's language competence and communication skills at 5‰Ûäyears were reported by mothers on three different validated scales; the ages and stages questionnaire (asq), the speech and language assessment scale (slas) and the twenty statements about language-related difficulties list (language20q). A total of 27‰Ûä428 women with 33‰Ûä407 singleton pregnancies were included. Use of analgesic opioids was reported in 584 pregnancies (1.7%). No associations between opioid use and lower language competence or communication skills were found. For asq, the or of being in the lowest category vs the group with maximum mean score was 0.82 (95%ci 0.57, 1.17), for slas the or of scoring worse than typical for age vs better than typical for age was 0.84 (0.61, 1.17) in children exposed to opioids in utero. For language20q using the best performance category as reference, the or of scoring in the lower performance category was 0.57 (0.35, 0.91) with exposure to opioids.

This study aims to compare two methods defining switching and add-on therapies and their impact on exposure-outcome associations. Additionally, to guide bias reduction, it aims to describe how the methods relate to immortal time bias and selection bias. Cohort study using swedish population-based health registers to identify antidepressant (ad) prescriptions as exposures while hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons were used as an empirical outcome example. The first method for exposure definition used conditioning on future exposure (fe), the second used the concept of uncertain exposure (ue). To estimate associations between outcome and exposure categories ""use of one ad,"" ""use of two or more ads"", and ""ue"" compared to ""unexposed,"" hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using cox regression adjusted for age and sex. Using the ue method, 7.2% of time periods were classified as ""ue"" with a notable proportion of psychiatric hospitalizations (7.7%) occurring during this time, while when using the fe method these hospitalizations were distributed over unexposed time and ad use time. The fe method resulted in slightly higher associations than the ue method. The highest hr was found during ""ue"": hr (95% ci) 5.54 (5.06-6.07). This study suggests that to reduce the potential immortal time bias, selection bias, and exposure misclassification inherent to the fe method, the ue method could be used for identifying switching and add-on therapies. If not used as a main exposure definition, the ue method may be used to investigate the impact of ue time in a sensitivity analysis.",34558772

This study analyzed the nonspecific aes occurring with active-drug exposure in rpccts for a large range of medical conditions. Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials published in five prominent medical journals during 2006-2012 were searched. Only trials that evaluated orally or parenterally administered active drugs versus placebo in a head-to-head setting were selected. For aes reported from ‰ä´10 rpccts, pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to determine the relationship between ae rates in placebo and active-drug recipients. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to compute proportions of nonspecific aes, which were truncated at a maximum of 100%, in active-drug recipients. We included 231 trials addressing various medical domains or healthy participants. For the 88 analyzed ae variables, ae rates for placebo and active-drug recipients were in general strongly correlated (råÊ>åÊ0.50) or very strongly correlated (råÊ>åÊ0.80). The pooled proportions of nonspecific aes for the active-drug recipients were 96.8% (95%ci: 95.5-98.1) for any aes, 100% (97.9-100) for serious aes, and 77.7% (72.7-83.2) for drug-related aes. Results were similar for individual medical domains and healthy participants. The pooled proportion of nonspecificity of 82 system organ class and individual ae types ranged from 38% to 100%. The large proportion of nonspecific aes reported in active-drug recipients of rpccts, including serious and drug-related aes, highlights the limitations of clinical trial data to determine the tolerability of drugs.

This study aimed to estimate the comorbidity burden and its relation to healthcare costs in patients using triptans in switzerland by analyzing a large population-based database. This retrospective cohort study was based on swiss health insurance claims data (2015/2016). The study sample comprised adult patients with ‰ä´1 triptan prescription in 2015. We evaluated pharmaceutically treated comorbid conditions (ccs) and costs (12‰Ûämonths after index prescription) of patients using triptan. Multivariable linear regression models with log-transformed outcomes were performed to identify the factors related to healthcare costs. From a total of 749‰Ûä092, we identified 10,090 patients using triptans (1-year prevalence of 1.35%), whereas 58.9% had ‰ä´2 ccs. The most frequent ccs were pain- and rheumatologic-related diseases and psychological disorders. Among triptan users, the mean total healthcare costs were highest in older patients with ‰ä´2 ccs (>64‰Ûäyears: migraine with ‰ä´2 cc ""12‰Ûä331 sfr""). Multivariate regression analyses showed that psychological disorders had the strongest impact on healthcare costs (coefficient: 1.29; 95%-ci: 1.27-1.31). The present study provides an overview of comorbidities and its related costs in migraine patients, which helps to quantify the current burden of migraine. This is relevant as the recently licensed cgrp antagonists are likely to change current treatment schemes for migraine, which strongly depends also on the comorbidities. The present study might therefore be helpful for the future development of treatment guidelines.",31828875

Our objectives were to validate diagnoses of ap and to identify an algorithm using additional data to enhance the identification of ap cases in different data sources. We randomly sampled 550 persons with an ap diagnosis from inpatient data or outpatient or emergency department diagnoses immediately preceding a hospitalization and 150 negative controls with a differential diagnosis (cholangitis or cholecystitis). We conducted an emr review to confirm cases of ap and used logistic regression to develop emr-based and claims-based algorithms to identify confirmed ap cases with variables typically available in electronic data sources. Algorithm performance was assessed using the c statistic, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. Of the 550 patients with an ap diagnosis, 467 (84.9%) were confirmed cases. An ap diagnosis alone had high sensitivity (98.9%), modest specificity (63.6%), and a c statistic of 0.813. An emr-based model using an ap diagnosis, body mass index ‰ä´30‰Ûäkg/m  , a serum lipase >3 times upper limit of normal and diabetes attained a c-statistic of 0.914.

Although measures to support smoking cessation have been implemented worldwide, smokers often fail to quit smoking after receiving pharmacotherapies for nicotine dependence. The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of varenicline for smoking cessation compared with no pharmacotherapy using actual paid medical cost data in japan. This was a retrospective cohort study of 3657 subjects who had quit smoking with varenicline or no pharmacotherapy. We extracted health examination and medical claim data from a health insurer database for the period 2012-2015. We calculated the incremental cost-effective ratio (icer) of varenicline using actual paid medical costs for nicotine dependence and the number needed to treat to maintain smoking cessation compared with no pharmacotherapy, considering sex, age, income, and occupation. The 1- and 2-year smoking cessation maintenance rates were 69.7% and 62.4%, respectively. We found that 8.8% of subjects who quit smoking used varenicline for nicotine dependence and the cost per person was japanese yen (jpy) 52‰Ûä177 (u.s. Dollars [usd] 474; usd 1åÊ=åÊjpy 110). The icer of varenicline was dominant when comparing 2-year cessation with 1-year cessation. Male, age <40‰Ûäyears, low income, and manufacturing workers were the most cost-effective variables.

The present case-control study explores the impact of underlying indications on this potential association. Physicians collected the medical history; prior 12-month drug use was obtained from standardized telephone interviews with patients. The association between aed use and sa was explored using multivariate conditional logistic regression. The analyses were replicated after stratification on depression and neurological disorders (epilepsy, migraine, and chronic neuropathic pain). Between 2008 and 2012, 506 adults with an incident sa were recruited in suicide treatment centers from across france and socio-demographically matched to 2829 controls from primary care settings. The association between aed use and odds of sa was not significant overall (odds ratio [or], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.9-2.4). No association was observed for patients with neurological disorders (or, 1.1; 95%ci, 0.5-2.4) as opposed to patients with depression (or, 1.6; 95%ci, 1.0-2.5), but unmeasured confounding was suspected. Our results suggest that the association observed between aed use and increased odds of non-fatal sa in patients with either a lifetime history of depression or no neurological disorder may be explained by the presence of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Accounting for underlying indications is crucial in drug safety studies, as these can cause a reported association (or lack thereof) to be misleading. This may require the prospective collection of medical data at a patient level. Copyright å© 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28052554

This study was conducted in a sample of italian long-term care nhs. Information on drug prescription, diseases, and socio-demographic characteristics of nh residents was collected three times during 2018. Appropriate use of ppi was defined in accordance with the strongest evidence-based indications and the italian criteria for ppi prescription. Among the 2579 patients recruited from 27 long-term care nhs, 1177 (45.6%) were receiving ppis; 597 (50.7%) were taking them for evidence-based indications. Corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and mean number of drugs were the most important predictors of inappropriate ppis prescriptions. Nh residents receiving ‰ä´13 drugs had about 10 times the risk of receiving a ppi than those taking 0 to 4 drugs. Similarly, residents with more comorbidity had about 2.5 times the risk of receiving a ppi than those in better health. The prevalence of residents inappropriately treated with ppi in individual nhs varied widely, ranging from 22% to 63%. Number of drugs, comorbidity, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants are the most important predictors of the inappropriate use of ppi in nhs. The wide variability between nhs in the appropriate use of ppis suggests the need for thorough drug review in this fragile and vulnerable population. Prescribing patterns linked to evidence-based guidelines and national recommendations are essential for rational, cost-effective use of ppis.",31990131

The number of reports was described as the number of mdrs per unique mdr number and stratified by different variables. The quality was assessed by the level of completeness of the collected pms data. The total number of reports related to mra was 2377, and the number of mdrs per year ranged between 84 in 2009 and 452 in 2017. Most of the reports were reported by manufacturer depuy johnson & johnson and were reported by a physician. In 44.9% of the reports, the device problem was reported as ""unknown."" when the device problem was known, in the majority of cases, it was related to an implant fracture. The quality of the collected data was assessed as low due to missing information.

We reviewed information from patient records, free text, and hospital episode statistics (hes) data, and excluded patients with no indication of a secondary care referral. Remaining patients were classified as probable, possible, or unlikely cases of sjs/ten by two specialised clinicians or based on pre-defined classification criteria. We quantified positive predictive values (ppv) for all sjs/ten patients and for patients categorised as 'probable/possible' cases of sjs/ten, based on a representative subsample of 118 patients for whom we had unequivocal information (original discharge letters or hes data). We identified 1324 patients with a diagnosis of sjs/ten, among whom 638 had a secondary care referral recorded. Of those, 565 were classified as probable or possible cases after expert review.

While theory suggests that the classical bootstrap can fail to produce proper coverage, practical impact of this theoretical limitation in settings typical to pharmacoepidemiology is not well studied. In a plasmode-based simulation study, we compared performance of the standard parametric approach, which ignores uncertainty in ps estimation and matching, with two bootstrapping methods. The first method only accounted for uncertainty introduced during the matching process (the observation resampling approach). The second method accounted for uncertainty introduced during both ps estimation and matching processes (the ps reestimation approach). Variance was estimated based on percentile and empirical standard errors, and treatment effect estimation was based on median and mean of the estimated treatment effects across 1000 bootstrap resamples. Two treatment prevalence scenarios (5% and 29%) across two treatment effect scenarios (hazard ratio of 1.0 and 2.0) were evaluated in 500 simulated cohorts of 10åÊ000 patients each. We observed that 95% confidence intervals from the bootstrapping approaches but not the standard approach, resulted in inaccurate coverage rates (98%-100% for the observation resampling approach, 99%-100% for the ps reestimation approach, and 95%-96% for standard approach). Treatment effect estimation based on bootstrapping approaches resulted in lower bias than the standard approach (less than 1.4% vs 4.1%) at 5% treatment prevalence; however, the performance was equivalent at 29% treatment prevalence. Use of bootstrapping led to variance overestimation and inconsistent coverage, while coverage remained more consistent with parametric estimation.",31020732
