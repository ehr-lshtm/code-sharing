The majority of icsrs at the netherlands pharmacovigilance centre lareb is reviewed manually to identify potential signal triggering reports (pstr) or icsrs which need further clinical assessment for other reasons. To develop a prediction model to identify icsrs that require clinical review, including pstrs. Secondly, to identify the most important features of these reports. All icsrs (n = 30 424) received by lareb between october 1, 2017 and february 26, 2021 were included. Icsrs originating from marketing authorisation holders and icsrs reported on vaccines were excluded. The outcome was defined as pstr (yes/no), where pstr 'yes' was defined as an icsr discussed at a signal detection meeting. Nineteen features were included, concerning structured information on: patients, adverse drug reactions (adr) or drugs. Data were divided into a training (70%) and test set (30%) using a stratified split to maintain the pstr/no pstr ratio. Logistic regression, elastic net logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting models were trained and tuned on a training set. Random down-sampling of negative controls was applied on the training set to adjust for the imbalanced dataset. Final models were evaluated on the test set. Model performances were assessed using the area under the curve (auc) with 95% confidence interval of a receiver operating characteristic (roc), and specificity and precision were assessed at a threshold for perfect sensitivity (100%, to not miss any pstrs). Feature importance plots were inspected and a selection of features was used to re-train and test model performances with fewer features. 1439 (4.7%) of reports were pstr. All three models performed equally with a highest auc of 0.75 (0.73-0.77). Despite moderate model performances, specificity (5%) and precision (5%) were low. Most important features were: 'absence of adr in the summary of product characteristics', 'adr reported as serious', 'adr labelled as an important medical event', 'adr reported by physician' and 'positive rechallenge'. Model performances were similar when using only nine of the most important features. We developed a prediction model with moderate performances to identify pstrs with nine commonly available features. Optimisation of the model using more icsr information (e.g., free text fields) to increase model precision is required before implementation.",36251280

However, the validity of diagnostic codes for ap is unknown. We aimed to determine the positive predictive value (ppv) of a diagnostic code-based algorithm for identifying patients with ap within the us veterans health administration and evaluate the value of adding readily available structured laboratory information. We identified patients with possible ap events first based on the presence of a single hospital discharge icd-9 or icd-10 diagnosis of ap (algorithm 1). We then expanded algorithm 1 by including relevant laboratory test results (algorithm 2). Specifically, we considered amylase or lipase serum values obtained between 2 days before admission and the end of the hospitalization. Medical records of a random sample of patients identified by the respective algorithms were reviewed by two separate gastroenterologists to adjudicate ap events. The ppv (95% confidence interval [ci]) for the algorithms were calculated. Algorithm 2, consisting of one icd-9 or icd-10 hospital discharge diagnosis of ap and the addition of lipase serum value ≥200 u/l, had a ppv 89.1% (95% ci 83.0%-95.2%), improving from the ppv of algorithm 1 (57.9% [95% ci 46.8-69.0]). An algorithm consisting of an icd-9 or icd-10 diagnosis of ap with a lipase value ≥200 u/l achieved high ppv. This simple algorithm can be readily implemented in any electronic health records (ehr) systems and could be useful for future pharmacoepidemiologic studies on ap.",36222554

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and performance of a deterministic linkage procedure based on indirect personal identifiers included in the data sources. We identified users of glucose-lowering drugs with residence in four federal states in northern and southern germany (bavaria, bremen, hamburg, lower saxony) in the german pharmacoepidemiological research database (gepard) and assessed colorectal and thyroid cancer cases. Cancer registries of the federal states selected all colorectal and thyroid cancer cases between 2004 and 2015. A deterministic linkage approach was performed based on indirect personal identifiers such as year of birth, sex, area of residence, type of cancer and an absolute difference between the dates of cancer diagnosis in both data sources of at most 90 days. Results were compared to a probabilistic linkage using ""direct"" personal identifiers (gold standard). The deterministic linkage procedure yielded a sensitivity of 71.8% for colorectal cancer and 66.6% for thyroid cancer. For thyroid cancer, the sensitivity improved when using only inpatient diagnosis to define cancer in gepard (71.4%). Specificity was always above 99%. Using the probabilistic linkage to define cancer cases, the risk for colorectal cancer was estimated 10 percentage points lower than when using the deterministic approach. Sensitivity of the deterministic linkage approach appears to be too low to be considered as reasonable alternative to the probabilistic linkage procedure.",36129372

49,Cafri G;Wood J;Gagne J,2022,Partition testing for real-world evidence studies.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.5540,"Traditional approaches to hypothesis testing in comparative post-approval safety and effectiveness studies of medical products are often inadequate because of a limited scope of possible inferences (e.g., superiority or inferiority). Often there is interest in simultaneously testing for superiority, equivalence, inferiority, non-inferiority, and non-superiority, which can be achieved using a partition testing framework. Partition testing only requires selection of an equivalence margin and calculation of a two-sided wald confidence interval. In addition to permitting a broader range of inferences, the strengths of the approach include: mitigating publication bias, avoiding use of a clinically irrelevant nil hypothesis, and more transparent and impartial appraisal of the clinical importance of a study's findings by pre-specifying an equivalence margin. However, a challenge in implementing the approach can be the process for identifying an equivalence margin. The methodology is illustrated using a published study of the safety of ondansetron for the off-label treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Applying the method to the study results would have led to a conclusion that women exposed to ondansetron in comparison to those that are not, are equivalent with respect to risk of cardiac malformations and oral clefts. These conclusions are more in line with the magnitude of the observed effects than the conclusions resulting from a traditional inferiority/superiority testing conducted by the study authors.",36089808

The extent of this practice in routine clinical care is however unknown. We aimed to evaluate the starting and maintenance ssri doses prescribed to patients stratified by levels of kidney function in real-world practice. Using data from the stockholm creatinine measurements (scream) project, we identified 101 409 new users of antidepressants (including 52 286 ssri users) in the region of stockholm during 2006-2019, who were ≥50 years of age and had a recent creatinine test taken in order to estimate glomerular filtration rate (egfr). Ssri dose reduction was defined as a prescribed ssri dose of ≤0.5 defined daily doses, according to current recommendations. We examined the associations between egfr and reductions in initial dose and maintenance dose of ssris using logistic regression models. Overall, reductions in initial and maintenance dose were observed among 54.1% and 34.1% of new ssri users. Nevertheless, about 40% of individuals with an egfr <30 ml/min/1.73 m  were prescribed an ssri without dose reduction. After adjusting for age and other covariates, lower egfr was associated with moderately higher odds of dose reduction, for both initial and maintenance dose. Compared to individuals with an egfr of 90-104 ml/min/1.73 m  , the adjusted odds ratios for those with an egfr <30 ml/min/1.73 m  were 1.18 (95% ci: 1.03, 1.36) for initial dose reduction, and 1.49 (1.29, 1.72) for maintenance dose reduction. Stratified analyses showed stronger associations between lower egfr and ssri dose reduction among individuals aged 50-64 years and in those receiving prescriptions from psychiatric care. Lower kidney function was moderately associated with a reduced ssri dose, independently of age. Prescribing ssris to middle-aged and older patients should not only consider patients' age but also their kidney function.",36076345

We sought to characterize the frequency, severity, type, and anatomic location of tees reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) following ad.26.cov2.s. Reports of tees after ad.26.cov2.s were identified in vaers, and demographics, clinical characteristics, and relevant medical history were summarized. For a subset of reports, physicians reviewed available medical records and evaluated clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, risk factors, and treatment. The crude reporting rate of tees was estimated based on case counts in vaers and vaccine administration data. Through february 28, 2022, fda identified 3790 reports of tees after ad.26.cov2.s. Median age was 56 years, and 1938 individuals (51.1%) were female. Most reports, 2892 (76.3%), were serious, including 421 deaths. Median time to onset was 12 days post-vaccination. Obesity and ischemia were among the most commonly documented risk factors. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 150 000/μl) was documented in 63 records (11.5%) and anti-platelet 4 antibodies in 25 (4.6%). Medical review identified cases of severe clot burden (e.g., bilateral, saddle, or other massive pulmonary embolism with or without cor pulmonale; lower extremity thrombus involving the external iliac, common femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal, and gastrocnemius veins). The crude reporting rate was ~20.7 cases of tee per 100 000 doses of ad.26.cov2.s administered. Life-threatening or fatal tees have been reported after ad.26.cov2.s, including bilateral massive pulmonary embolism or other severe clot burden.",36065046

Using a two-stage cluster design, pharmacies were sampled with probabilities proportional to the volume of dispensed oas; 100 random oa prescriptions were sampled from pdmp records submitted by each pharmacy. Following recruitment, demographic information and hard-copy prescription data for sampled records were abstracted on-site. Days' supply was independently calculated by two pharmacists using a standard formula with disagreements adjudicated blindly by a third pharmacist. Adjudicated days' supply was compared with that submitted to the pdmp and classified as accurate/inaccurate. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between accuracy and prescription/practice-related factors. A total of 1281 oa prescriptions were reviewed at 13 participating pharmacies. Accuracy of reported oa days' supply was 89.85%, (95% ci: 86.90, 92.80). Factors associated with accuracy were presence of special instructions from the prescriber (or 3.13 [95% ci: 1.43, 6.82]), presence of 'as-needed' directions (or 0.29 [95% ci: 0.18, 0.47]), and billing to a third-party payer (or 1.43 [95% ci: 1.01, 2.02]). Accuracy of oa days' supply reported to the state pdmp was found to be moderately high. Certain prescription-related factors influence accuracy and should be accounted for in future studies. Patterns, including opioid 'split-billing' were identified and may impact validity of pdmp and administrative claims studies.",36053913
58,Suissa K;Hudson M;Suissa S,2022,Glucosamine and lower mortality and cancer incidence: selection bias in the observational studies.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.5535,"Glucosamine is a widely used supplement to treat joint pain and osteoarthritis despite inconclusive randomized trial results on its effectiveness. In contrast, observational studies associate glucosamine with significant reductions in mortality and cancer incidence. We evaluated the extent of bias, particularly selection bias, to explain these surprising beneficial effects. We searched the literature to identify all observational studies reporting on the effect of glucosamine use on major outcomes. We identified 11 observational studies, reporting a mean 16% reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [hr] 0.84, 95% ci: 0.81-0.87) with glucosamine use, as well as significant reductions in cancer incidence and other major diseases including cardiovascular, respiratory and diabetes. We show that these significant effects can result from selection bias due to collider stratification, as all studies used ""prevalent"" cohorts, where glucosamine use started before cohort entry, and where subjects agreed to join the cohorts. Our illustration of the bias using the uk biobank publication involving a half-million subjects shows how a true rate ratio of mortality of 1.0 in the population can result in a biased rate ratio of 0.82 in the prevalent cohort. The observational studies reporting significant reductions in mortality, cancer incidence and other outcomes with glucosamine were affected by selection bias from collider stratification. In the absence of properly conducted observational studies that circumvent this bias by considering ""new users"", the studies to date cannot support the prescription of this supplement as a preventive measure for mortality, cancer, and other chronic diseases.",36029480

Using data from the national poison data system for 2000-2020, population-based annual exposure rates by sex, antidepressant category, serious medical outcome, and health care facility admission were analyzed and odds ratios to assess associations of exposure type and antidepressant category with medical outcome and admission were calculated. There were 215 909 first-ranked unintentional exploratory exposures involving antidepressants among children <6 years old during the study period, averaging 10 281 annually. Most cases were <3 years old (77.8%), involved a single substance (86.9%), and did not receive treatment at a health care facility (57.6%); however, 7.9% were admitted and 3.4% had serious medical outcomes, including 13 deaths. Ssris were involved in 56.9% of all cases. Compared with ssris, bupropion (or: 5.22, 95% ci: 4.68-5.82), tcas (or: 3.74, 95% ci: 3.44-4.07), snris (or: 2.39, 95% ci: 2.11-2.71), and lithium salts (or: 2.00, 95% ci: 1.63-2.46) were more likely to be associated with a serious medical outcome. Tcas were the first-ranked substance in 7 of the 13 deaths. Although most unintentional antidepressant exposures related to pediatric exploratory behavior were inconsequential, an important minority of cases required admission to a hcf or had a serious medical outcome, including 13 deaths. Therefore, increased efforts to prevent these exposures among young children are needed, including public education and improved medication packaging.",35999648

Data generated through digital tools may be categorized as relevant to efficacy and/or safety. The enormity of these data requires the adoption of new approaches for processing and evaluation. Recognition of patterns within the safety data is vital for sponsors seeking regulatory approval for their new products. Nontraditional data sources may contain relevant safety information; early evaluation of these data will help to determine the product safety profile. Advanced technologies have allowed the development of digital tools to screen these data, which in some situations are classified as software as a medical devices and subject to clinical evaluation and post-marketing surveillance. Artificial intelligence may help to reduce or even eliminate noise from within these data, allowing safety experts to focus on the most pertinent evidence. We propose a data typology and provide considerations on how to define adverse events within different types of data, even where no human reporter exists. Proposals are made for the automation of screening processes. We consider validation aspects to support solutions that are proven to produce reliable results, and to deliver trusted outputs to stakeholders.",35996833

We queried english-language articles from pubmed, web of science, clinicaltrials.gov, and the cdc library of gray literature databases using keywords of ""coronavirus,"" ""covid,"" ""clinical trial"" and ""randomized controlled trial"" from january 2020 to june 2021. From the search, we conducted an initial review to rule-out duplicate entries, identify those that met inclusion criteria (i.e., had results), and exclude those that did not meet the definition of an rct. Lastly, we abstracted the demographic and clinical characteristics reported on within each rct. From the initial 43 627 manuscripts, our final eligible manuscripts consisted of 149 rcts described in 137 articles. Most of the rcts (113/149) studied potential treatments, while fewer studied vaccines (29), prophylaxis strategies (5), and interventions to prevent transmission among those infected (2). Study populations ranged from 10 to 38 206 participants (median = 100, iqr: 60-300). All 149 rcts reported on age, 147 on sex, 50 on race, and 110 on the prevalence of at least one comorbidity. No rcts reported on income, urban versus rural residence, or other indicators of socioeconomic status (ses). Limited reporting on race and other markers of ses make it difficult to draw conclusions about specific external target populations without making strong assumptions that treatment effects are homogenous. These findings highlight the need for more robust reporting on the clinical and demographic profiles of patients enrolled in covid-19 related rcts.",35996832

We performed a retrospective cohort study on electronic health record data from 117 126 veterans (mean age 49.2 years) diagnosed with back pain in 2015. We used latent class growth analysis to jointly model pain intensity (0-10 scores) and opioid prescriptions over 2 years to identify classes of individuals similar in their trajectory of pain and opioid over time. Multivariable multinomial logit models assessed sociodemographic and clinical predictors of class membership. We identified six trajectory classes: a ""no pain/no opioid"" class (22.2%), a ""mild pain/no opioid"" class (45.0%), a ""moderate pain/no opioid"" class (24.6%), a ""moderate, decreasing pain/decreasing opioid"" class (3.3%), a ""moderate pain/high opioid"" class (2.6%), and a ""moderate, increasing pain/increasing opioid"" class (2.3%). Among those in moderate pain classes, being white (vs. Non-white) and older were associated with higher odds of being prescribed opioids. Veterans with mental health diagnoses had increased odds of being in the painful classes versus ""no pain/no opioid"" class. We found distinct patterns in the long-term joint course of pain and opioid prescription in veterans with back pain. Understanding these patterns and associated predictors may help with development of targeted interventions for patients with back pain.",35996825

To describe pre- and post-stroke medication use, focusing on antithrombotic therapy and mortality risk, in individuals hospitalised for ischaemic stroke (is) in the united kingdom. Using primary care electronic health records from the united kingdom, we identified patients hospitalised for is (july 2016-september 2019) and classed them into three groups: atrial fibrillation (af) diagnosed pre-stroke, af diagnosed post-stroke, and non-af stroke (no af diagnosed pre-/post-stroke). We determined use of cardiovascular medications in the 90 days pre- and post-stroke and calculated mortality rates. There were 3201 hospitalised is cases: 76.2% non-af stroke, 15.7% af pre-stroke, and 8.1% af post-stroke. Oral anticoagulant (oac) use increased between the pre- and post-stroke periods as follows: 54.3%-78.7% (af pre-stroke group), 2.3%-84.8% (af post-stroke group), and 3.4%-7.3% (non-af stroke group). Corresponding increases in antiplatelet use were 30.8%-35.4% (af pre-stroke group) 38.5%-47.5% (af post-stroke group), and 37.5%-87.3% (non-af stroke group). Among all is cases, antihypertensive use increased from 66.8% pre-stroke to 78.8% post-stroke; statin use increased from 49.6%-85.2%. Mortality rates per 100 person-years (95% ci) were 17.30 (14.70-20.35) in the af pre-stroke group and 9.65 (8.81-10.56) among all other stroke cases.

This study aimed to determine if csvv risk differed among patients with atrial fibrillation (afib) who newly initiated warfarin or a doac. We identified enrollees aged ≥21 years diagnosed with afib who newly initiated rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, and warfarin in the sentinel distributed database from october 19, 2010 to february 29, 2020. We selected and followed patients who did not have evidence of the following in the 183 days prior to initiating treatment: csvv diagnosis, dispensing of other study drugs, select autoimmune diseases or autoimmune medications, cancer diagnoses or chemotherapeutic treatment, kidney dialysis or transplant, alternative anticoagulation indications, or an institutional (nursing home, hospice, hospital) stay on the treatment initiation date (index date) until csvv outcome or pre-specified censoring. We conducted 1:1 propensity score matching in six comparisons. Csvv incidence rates for doacs and warfarin ranged from 3.3 to 5.6 per 10 000-person years in our matched afib population. The adjusted csvv hazard ratio (hr) and 95% confidence interval (ci) was 0.94 (0.64, 1.39) for rivaroxaban versus warfarin; 1.17 (0.67, 2.06) for dabigatran vs. Warfarin; 0.85 (0.62, 1.16) for apixaban vs. Warfarin; 0.86 (0.49, 1.50) for rivaroxaban vs. Dabigatran; 0.99 (0.68, 1.45) for rivaroxaban versus apixaban; and 1.70 (0.90, 3.21) for dabigatran versus apixaban.

We aimed to prospectively investigate the incidence of adrs to first-line anti-tb drugs and related outcomes and qol. Adult patients with tb who had been treated with first-line anti-tb drugs in five korean hospitals were enrolled. Adr questionnaire surveys and blood tests were performed four times serially, and qol was assessed on the fourth tb treatment week (±2 weeks). Of 410 enrolled patients with tb (males, 62%; mean age, 52.1 ± 18.1 years [those aged ≥65 years, 26.6%]), 67.8% experienced any adrs (≥ grade 2) to tb drugs. The most common adr was fatigue (53.2%), followed by itching (42.7%) and anorexia (41.7%). Older adult patients experienced relatively more adrs, including anorexia, dyspepsia, rash, dizziness, anemia, abnormal hepatic/renal function tests, and increased uric acid levels (p < 0.05). Treatment regimens changed for 9.5% of patients owing to adrs to anti-tb drugs. Patients with any adrs and older adult patients had significantly lower qol than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Old age (odds ratio [or], 1.02) and being male (or 2.65) were independently associated with adrs, whereas active smoking (or 4.73) and a relatively long treatment phase (or 5.13) were independently associated with hepatotoxicity.

In this review, we provide an overview of drug utilization measures that can be used with individual-level drug dispensing data, referencing additional reading on the individual analysis. This is intended to serve as a primer for those new to drug utilization research and a shortlist from which researchers can identify useful analytical approaches when designing their drug utilization study. We provide an overview of: (1) basic measures of drug utilization which are used to describe changes in drug use over time or compare drug use in different populations; (2) treatment adherence measures with specific focus on persistence and implementation; (3) how to measure drug combinations which is useful when assessing drug-drug interactions, concomitant treatment, and polypharmacy; (4) prescribing quality indicators and measures to assess variations in drug use which are useful tools to assess appropriate use of drugs; (5) proxies of prescription drug misuse and skewness in drug use; and (6) considerations when describing the characteristics of drug users or prescribers.",35819240

Cardinality matching (cm), an optimization algorithm, overcomes these limitations by matching directly on the marginal distribution of covariates. This study compared the performance of psm and cm. Comparative cohort study of new users of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (acei) and β-blocker monotherapy identified from a large u.s. Administrative claims database. One-to-one matching was conducted through psm using nearest-neighbor matching (caliper = 0.15) and cm permitting a maximum standardized mean difference (smd) of 0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 between comparison groups. Matching covariates included 37 patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Observed covariates included patient demographics, and all observed prior conditions, drug exposures, and procedures. Residual confounding was assessed based on the expected absolute systematic error of negative control outcome experiments. Psm and cm were compared in terms of post-match patient retention, matching and observed covariate balance, and residual confounding within a 10%, 1%, 0.25% and 0.125% sample group. The eligible study population included 182 235 (acei: 129363; β-blocker: 56872) patients. Cm achieved superior patient retention and matching covariate balance in all analyses. After psm, 1.6% and 28.2% of matching covariates were imbalanced in the 10% and 0.125% sample groups, respectively. No significant difference in observed covariate balance was observed between matching techniques. Cm permitting a maximum smd <0.05 was associated with improved residual bias as compared to psm. We recommend cm with more stringent balance criteria as an alternative to psm when matching on a set of clinically relevant covariates.",35811396

Our aim was to describe changes in prescription drugs dispensing in the primary and outpatient sectors during the first year of the pandemic across europe. We used routine administrative data on dispensed medicines in eight european countries (five whole countries, three represented by one region each) from january 2017 to march 2021 to compare the first year of the covid-19 pandemic with the preceding 3 years. In the 10 therapeutic subgroups with the highest dispensed volumes across all countries/regions the relative changes between the covid-19 period and the year before were mostly of a magnitude similar to changes between previous periods. However, for drugs for obstructive airway diseases the changes in the covid-19 period were stronger in several countries/regions. In all countries/regions a decrease in dispensed ddds of antibiotics for systemic use (from -39.4% in romagna to -14.2% in scotland) and nasal preparations (from -34.4% in lithuania to -5.7% in sweden) was observed. We observed a stockpiling effect in the total market in march 2020 in six countries/regions. In czechia the observed increase was not significant and in slovenia volumes increased only after the end of the first lockdown. We found an increase in average therapeutic quantity per pack dispensed, which, however, exceeded 5% only in slovenia, germany, and czechia. The findings from this first european cross-national comparison show a substantial decrease in dispensed volumes of antibiotics for systemic use in all countries/regions. The results also indicate that the provision of medicines for common chronic conditions was mostly resilient to challenges faced during the pandemic. However, there were notable differences between the countries/regions for some therapeutic areas.",35791700

The australian advisory noted that males were at higher risk of bladder cancer than females, while the uk advisory highlighted a new recommendation, suggest careful consideration in the elderly due to increasing risk with age. This study examined whether these differences in the advisories had different age- and sex-based impacts in each country. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare pioglitazone use (prescriptions/100000 population) in australia and the united kingdom for the 24 months before and 11 months after the july 2011 safety advisories (study period july 2009-june 2012). Separate models were used to compare use by sex and age group (≥65 years vs. <65 years) in each country. Pioglitazone use fell in australia (17%) and the united kingdom (24%) following the safety advisories. Use of pioglitazone fell more for males (18%) than females (16%) in australia, and more for females (25%) than males (23%) in the united kingdom; however, neither difference was statistically significant (australia p = 0.445, united kingdom p = 0.462). Pioglitazone use fell to a similar extent among older people than younger people in the united kingdom (23% vs. 26%, p = 0.354), and did not differ between age groups in australia (both 18%, p = 0.772). The results indicate that differences in the australian and uk safety advisories resulted in substantial reductions in pioglitazone use at the population level in both countries, however, differences by sub-groups were not observed.",35790047

This study evaluates the performance characteristics of code-based algorithms to identify uti. Retrospective observational study of adults contained within three large u.s. Administrative claims databases on or after january 1, 2010. A targeted literature review was performed to inform the development of 10 code-based algorithms to identify utis consisting of combinations of diagnosis codes, antibiotic exposure for the treatment of utis, and/or ordering of a urinalysis or urine culture. For each database, a probabilistic gold standard was developed using phevaluator. The performance characteristics of each code-based algorithm were assessed compared with the probabilistic gold standard. A total of 2 950 641, 1 831 405, and 2 294 929 patients meeting study criteria were identified in each database. Overall, the code-based algorithm requiring a primary uti diagnosis code achieved the highest positive predictive values (ppv; >93.8%) but the lowest sensitivities (<12.9%). Algorithms requiring three uti diagnosis codes achieved similar ppv (>0.899%) and improved sensitivity (<41.6%). Algorithms requiring a single uti diagnosis code in any position achieved the highest sensitivities (>72.1%) alongside a slight reduction in ppvs (<78.3%). All-time prevalence estimates of uti ranged from 21.6% to 48.6%. Based on these findings, we recommend use of algorithms requiring a single uti diagnosis code, which achieved high sensitivity and ppv. In studies where ppv is critical, we recommend code-based algorithms requiring three uti diagnosis codes rather than a single primary uti diagnosis code.",35790044

We sought to characterize pims by level of polypharmacy by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We performed a cross-sectional drug dispensing study using electronic health records available through the us department of veterans affairs. We extracted pharmacy fill and refill records during fiscal year 2016 (i.e., october 1, 2015-september 30, 2016) for all patients aged 49-70 who accessed care in the preceding fiscal year. Pims were defined by the combined beers and laroche (henceforth beers laroche) criteria used for older patients and the prompt criteria used for middle-aged. In the 1 499 586 patients aged 49-64, pims prevalence by prompt in patients with 0-4, 5-9, and ≥10 medications was 14.0%, 62.2%, and 86.1%, respectively, and by beers laroche was 14.3%, 63.4%, and 85.7%, respectively. In the 1 249 119 patients aged 65-70, pims prevalence by beers laroche was 14.8%, 59.9%, and 83.3%, and by prompt was 13.9%, 57.4%, and 82.0%, respectively. Meaningful differences in prevalence were shown by sex and race/ethnicity according to both set of criteria (e.g. Prompt in patients with 5-9 medications: 66.1% women vs. 59.3% men; standardized-mean-differences [smd] = 0.14; 61.7% of white vs. 54.5% of non-white; smd = 0.15). The most common pims were digestive, analgesic, antidiabetic, and psychotropic medications. Prevalence of pims was high and increased with polypharmacy. Beers laroche and prompt provided similar estimations inside and outside their target age, suggesting that pims are common among those with polypharmacy regardless of age.",35780391

However, the prevalence of these biases in perinatal pharmacoepidemiology is not well understood. To describe the frequency of time-related biases in observational studies of medications commonly used during pregnancy (antibiotic, antifungal, and antiemetic drugs) via systematic review. We searched medline and embase for observational studies published between january 2013 and september 2020 and examining the association between antibiotic, antifungal, or antiemetic drugs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm delivery, small-for-gestational age, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. The proportion of studies with time-related biases was estimated overall and by type (immortal time bias, time-window bias). Our systematic review included 20 studies (16 cohort studies, 3 nested case-control studies, and 1 case-control study), of which 12 examined antibiotic, 6 antiemetic, and 2 anti-fungal drugs. Eleven studies (55%) had immortal time bias due to the misclassification of unexposed, event-free person-time between cohort entry and exposure initiation as exposed. No included study had time-window bias. The direction of effect varied for both studies with and without time-related bias, with many studies reporting very wide confidence intervals around the effect estimates, thus making the direction of effect less interpretable. However, studies with time-related bias were more likely to show protective or null associations compared with studies without time-related bias. Time-related biases occur frequently in observational studies of drug effects during pregnancy. The use of appropriate study design and analytical approaches is needed to prevent time-related biases and ensure study validity.",35753061

The unstructured format and sheer volume of these data often render them neglected. Structural topic modelling (stm) represents a potentially insightful way of harnessing these valuable data and to detect grouping or themes in spontaneous reports to aid signal detection. This was an explorative study of the potential for structural topic modelling to identify useful patterns in adr reports involving opioid drugs in a pharmacovigilance database. A dataset of adr reports on opioid drugs reported to the netherlands pharmacovigilance centre lareb from 1991 to december 2020 was used, comprising a total of 3069 unique reports. Qualitative text analysis was combined with stm, an automated text analysis method, to examine these data. In reports submitted directly by patients and healthcare professionals, 11 meaningful topics were identified, whereby patient experience reports, particularly in relation to pain (relief), and the timing of intake and adrs of tramadol and paracetamol, were the most common. Of the 12 topics identified in reports received via marketing authorization holders, patch and skin-related side effects, addiction and constipation were the most prevalent. The stm-based analysis identified information that cannot always be captured by coding with the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra®). The identified topics reflect findings in the literature on opioids.",35751621

Concerns have been raised about using exposure assessment time too close to the outcome. We investigated the association between use of α1-adrenoceptor antagonists indicated for benign prostate hyperplasia and risk of alzheimer's disease (ad) using different exposure windows. The study (24 602 cases and 98 397 matched controls) included men from the finnish nationwide nested case-control study on medication and alzheimer's disease (medalz). Cases received clinically verified ad diagnosis during 2005-2011 and were community-dwelling at the time of diagnosis. Use of tamsulosin and alfuzosin in 1995-2011 was identified from the prescription register and categorized based on whether it had occurred within 3 years before ad diagnosis (lag time) or before that. Dose-response analysis using defined daily doses of drug (ddds) was conducted. Associations were investigated with conditional logistic regression, adjusted for confounders and mediators. The use of α1-adrenoceptor antagonists before lag time associated with an increased risk of ad (or 1.24 [1.20-1.27]). After adjustment for comorbidities and concomitant drug use throughout the assessment time (confounders) and healthcare contacts within the lag period (mediators), the association weakened (aor 1.10 [1.06-1.14]). We found no evidence of dose-response-relationship when comparing the users of higher than median ddds to the users of lower than median ddds. Our findings, especially the lack of dose-response-relationship and attenuation after mediator adjustment, do not provide strong support for the previous hypothesis on α1-adrenoceptor antagonists as a risk factor for dementia.",35751619

Consequently, there has been a recent focus on the development of data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic research. In this paper, we survey current approaches and recent advancements for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in healthcare database studies. We discuss considerations underpinning three areas for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment: (1) feature generation-transforming raw data into covariates (or features) to be used for proxy adjustment; (2) covariate prioritization, selection, and adjustment; and (3) diagnostic assessment. We discuss challenges and avenues of future development within each area. There is a large literature on methods for high-dimensional confounder prioritization/selection, but relatively little has been written on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment. Consequently, these areas have particular limitations and challenges. There is a growing body of evidence showing that machine-learning algorithms for high-dimensional proxy-confounder adjustment can supplement investigator-specified variables to improve confounding control compared to adjustment based on investigator-specified variables alone. However, more research is needed on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment when applying methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic studies.",35729705

Among 21 946 participants, 454 total, 89 stomach, 67 colorectal, 51 lung, 39 breast and 99 prostate invasive cancer cases were newly diagnosed in the cancer registry. For invasive cancer, the sensitivity and specificity of the definition that combined codes for diagnosis and procedures for cancer therapy were 87.0% and 99.4% for total, 88.8% and 99.9% for stomach, 80.6% and 99.9% for colorectal, 86.3% and 99.9% for lung, 100% and 99.9% for breast and 91.9% and 99.9% for prostate cancer, respectively.

Loop diuretics are commonly prescribed to manage volume overload in hf and may increase the risk of volume depletion in real-world practice. This study evaluated the risk of volume depletion following concomitant use of sglt2is and loop diuretics in veterans. Veterans with t2dm were included if they received concomitant loop diuretics and sglt2is and experienced at least one volume depletion event between december 2012 and december 2019, utilizing a self-controlled case series design. Concomitant prescribing periods were divided into focal windows of 1 to 14 days, 14 to 28 days, and greater than 28 days. Incidence rate ratios (irr) were estimated using multivariable poisson regressions adjusted for age and renal function. 3352 patients experienced at least one volume depletion event and were concomitantly prescribed sglt2is and loop diuretics at least once. The risk of volume depletion increased in the treatment versus control windows during the 1 to 14-day window (irr = 1.82, 95% ci 1.63-2.02) the 15-to-28-day window (irr = 1.46, 95% ci 1.28-1.67), and the greater than 28-day window (irr = 1.22, 95% ci 1.21-1.34). Concomitant prescribing of sglt2is and loop diuretics is associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, an effect that attenuates with longer therapy durations.

We aimed to separately assess the role of effects of the antidepressants and anxiolytic and the underlying illness, controlled by potential confounding associated with miscarriage onset. We used data from a validated pregnant cohort aged 15-49 years from 2002 to 2016 using bifap database. All confirmed miscarriages were used to perform a nested control analysis using conditional logistic regression. Women were classified according to use of each drug of interest into four mutually exclusive groups: nonusers, users only during prepregnancy, continuers, and initiators during first trimester. Adjusted odds ratios (aors) for major confounders during pregnancy such as number of visits to primary care practitioners visits, obesity, smoking, hta, diabetes with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Compared with nonusers, antidepressants continuers had the highest increased risk of miscarriage aor (95%) of 1.29 (1.13-1.46), being continuers of paroxetine and fluoxetine the antidepressants with the strongest association. Likewise, continuers of anxiolytics and initiators showed an increased risk of 1.19 (1.04-1.37) and 1.30 (1.13-1.50). When separating the effect between the condition itself or the treatment, women exposed during first trimester, regardless treatment duration and/or the underlying illness, had the highest risk 1.27 (1.08-1.51) for antidepressants and 1.25 (1.13-1.39) for anxiolytics. Our analysis showed an association between prenatal exposure to antidepressants and anxiolytics and miscarriage onset after controlling by potential confounding adjusting for confounders and the underlying illness. This association was not supported for hypnotic medications. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the risk of miscarriage among subpopulation of pregnant women requiring these medications.",35689300

The median onset for all cases was 36 (range 0-880) days, and no statistical difference was observed between monotherapy and combination therapy (pd-1 or pd-l1 plus ctla-4) (p = 0.21). Most patients required drug withdrawal treatment (n = 113, 74%) and can achieve a recovered-resolved state (n = 72, 46%). All icis were significantly associated with ileus (ror = 4.27, 95%cl: 3.75-4.85; ic = 2.04, 95%cl: 1.79-2.31). Ileus events were most commonly reported in pd-1 treatment (n = 164, ror = 3.83, 95%cl: 3.28-4.48; ic = 1.90, 95%cl: 1.62-2.21). This pharmacovigilance database analysis suggested that icis are related to ileus. However, combination therapy may not speed up the onset of ileus.",35689298

We validated icd-10-cm hf diagnosis codes among kaiser permanente washington enrollees who were ≥18 years of age and had an icd-10-cm hf diagnosis code during 2017-2018 and a procedure code for an echocardiogram in the 12 months before through 6 months after the hf code. Left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) ascertained from medical chart review was used as the gold standard for classifying patients as having reduced ejection fraction (ref), mid-range ejection fraction (mef), or preserved ejection fraction (pef). Among 6194 eligible patients, we randomly sampled 1000 for medical chart review. A total of 974 patients had lvef information in their chart. The icd-10-cm hf code group with the highest ppv for ref was i50.20-i50.23, ""systolic (congestive) heart failure,"" ppv = 41.4% (95% ci, 34.5-48.7%); and the highest ppv for mef or ref was also i50.20-i50.23, ppv = 70.2% (95% ci, 63.1-76.4%). The highest ppv for pef was the i50.30-i50.33 group, ""diastolic (congestive) heart failure,"" ppv = 92.0% (95% ci, 88.1-94.7%); and the highest ppv for mef or pef was also i50.30-i50.33, ppv = 97.7% (95% ci, 95.1-99.0%). If the accuracy measure of greatest interest is ppv, our results suggest that icd-10-cm hf codes alone may not be adequate for identifying patients with ref but may be adequate for identifying patients with pef.

Some recent evidence suggests that among ansclc patients with pd-l1 + e of ≥50% receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy, very high levels of pd-l1 + e (≥90%) may be associated with better outcomes. We sought to assess whether very high pd-l1 + e (≥90%) compared to high pd-l1 + e (50%-89%) is associated with an overall survival benefit in ansclc patients receiving anti-pd-(l)1 monotherapies. We conducted a single-site retrospective cohort study of ansclc patients who initiated pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy as the first-line treatment from october 24, 2016, to august 25, 2021, and had a pd-l1 + e ≥ 50%. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from the start of the first-line pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy (index date) to date of death or last confirmed activity prior to the cohort exit date. Propensity score-based inverse probability weighting (ipw) was used to control for confounding in kaplan-meier curves and cox proportional hazard regression analysis. One hundred sixty-six patients with ansclc receiving pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy met inclusion criteria. 54% were female, 90% received pembrolizumab, median age was 68 years, 70% had non-squamous cell carcinoma, 94% had a history of smoking, 29% had a kras mutation, and 37% had very high pd-l1 + e. Unweighted covariates at cohort entry were similar between groups (absolute standardized mean differences [smds] <0.1) except for race (smd = 0.2); age at therapy initiation (smd = 0.13); smoking status (smd = 0.13), and braf mutation status (smd = 0.11). After weighting, baseline covariates were well balanced (all absolute smds <0.1). In the weighted analysis, having a very high pd-l1 + e was associated with lower mortality (weighted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% ci 0.36-0.90) and longer median survival: 3.85 versus 1.49 years. Very high pd-l1 + e (≥90%) was associated with an overall survival benefit over high pd-l1 + e (50%-89%) in patients receiving the first-line pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy in a model controlling for potential confounders. These findings should be confirmed in a larger real-world data set.",35670103

From the danish national patient registry, we ascertained information about hematological procedure codes and date of procedure registered on each patient and generated random samples. Using medical record review as the reference standard, we validated procedure codes in the danish national patient registry and calculated positive predictive values (ppvs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for each procedure code. A total of 523 medical records (99% of the total sample) were available for review. Ppvs for specific procedure codes ranged from 71% to 100%.

There is limited data on the treatments used for depression in this population. The aim of this study was to explore the rates of initiation of antidepressant prescriptions in people with type 2 diabetes in the uk and identify those most at risk of needing such treatment. This was a retrospective cohort study using data from iqvia medical research data (imrd)-uk data. Data from general practices in imrd-uk between january 2008 and december 2017 were used for this study. The overall rates of antidepressant prescribing were stable over the study period. The rate of initiation of antidepressant medication in people with type 2 diabetes was 22.93 per 1000 person years at risk (pyar) with a 95%ci 22.48 to 23.39 compared to 16.89 per 1000 pyar (95%ci 16.77 to 17.01) in an age and gender matched cohort. The risk of being prescribed antidepressant medication with age had a u-shaped distribution with the lowest risk in the 65-69 age group. The peak age for antidepressant initiation in men and women was 40-44, with a rate in men of 32.78 per 1000 pyar (95% ci 29.57 to 36.34) and a rate in women of 46.80 per 1000 pyar (95% ci 41.90 to 52.26). People with type 2 diabetes with in the least deprived quintile had an initiation rate of 19.66 per 1000 pyar (95%ci 18.67 to 20.70) compared to 27.19 per 1000 pyar (95%ci 25.50 to 28.93) in the most deprived quintile, with a 32% increase in the risk of starting antidepressant medication (95%ci 1.22 to 1.43). People with type 2 diabetes were 30% more likely to be started on antidepressant medication than people without type 2 diabetes. Women with type 2 diabetes were 35% more likely than men to be prescribed antidepressants and the risks increased with deprivation and in younger or older adults, with the lowest rates in the 65-69 year age band. The rates of antidepressant prescribing were broadly stable over the 10-year period in this study. The antidepressant medications prescribed changed slightly over time with sertraline becoming more widely used and fewer prescriptions of citalopram.",35638365

While pregnancies have historically been identified in such databases by pregnancy outcomes, international classification of diseases, 10th revision clinical modification (icd-10-cm) z3a codes denoting weeks of gestation provide more granular information on pregnancies and pregnancy periods (i.e., start and end dates). The purpose of this study was to develop a process that uses z3a codes to identify pregnancies, pregnancy periods, and links infants within a commercial health insurance claims database. We identified pregnancies, gestation periods, pregnancy outcomes, and linked infants within the us-based optum research database between 2015 and 2020 via a series of algorithms utilizing diagnosis and procedure codes on claims. The diagnosis and procedure codes included icd-10-cm codes, current procedural terminology (cpt) codes, and healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) codes. We identified 1 030 874 pregnancies among 841 196 women of reproductive age. Of pregnancies with livebirth outcomes, 84% were successfully linked to infants. The prevalence of pregnancy outcomes (livebirth, stillbirth, ectopic, molar, and abortion) was similar to national estimates. This process provides an opportunity to study drug safety and care patterns during pregnancy and may be replicated in other claims databases containing icd-10-cm, cpt, and hcpcs codes. Work is underway to validate and refine the various algorithms.",35622900

Antimuscarinics are the backbone of the pharmacological management of overactive bladder. However, the safety profiles of antimuscarinics vary because of their dissimilarities to muscarinic receptor-subtype affinities and are associated with differential central anticholinergic adverse effects. This study aimed to examine delirium risk in new users of oxybutynin and solifenacin in older adults (≥ 65 years). In the secondary analyses, we examined the risk of delirium by type and dose of antimuscarinic. We applied a case-time-control design to investigate delirium risk in older adults who started taking oxybutynin and solifenacin. We used a nationwide inpatient hospital data (2005-2016), national minimum data set, maintained by the ministry of health, new zealand (nz), to identify older adults with a new-onset diagnosis of delirium. Eligible patients were older adults aged 65 at entry into the cohort on 1/1/2006. We used dispensing claims data to determine antimuscarinic treatment exposure. The antimuscarinic included in the study were new users of oxybutynin and solifenacin. These two antimuscarinics are subsidised by the pharmaceutical management agency and are the most frequently used antimuscarinic in nz. A conditional logistic regression model was used to compute matched odds ratios (mors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). In the case-time-control design, we made separate analyses to evaluate the dose-response risk of delirium. We identified 4818 individuals (mean age 82.14) from 2005 to 2015 with incident delirium and were exposed to at least one of the antimuscarinic of interest. The case-time-control matched odds ratio (mor) for delirium with oxybutynin was (2.06, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.07-3.96). Solifenacin was not associated with delirium (0.89 95%ci 0.64-1.23). In the sensitivity analyses, the case-time-control mor for delirium using a shorter risk period (0-3 days) did not change the results. The dose-response risk of delirium was significant for oxybutynin (0.05, 95%ci 0.02-0.08) but not for solifenacin (-0.01, 95%ci -0.03 to 0.00). In addition, in the subgroup analyses, a statistically significant association of delirium was found for oxybutynin but not for solifenacin in the non-dementia cohort (2.11,95% ci 1.08-4.13) and the dementia cohort (1.25, 95%ci 0.05-26.9). The study found that oxybutynin but not solifenacin is associated with a risk of new-onset delirium in older adults. The higher blockade of m1 and m2 receptors by oxybutynin is likely to contribute to delirium than solifenacin, which is highly selective for the m3 receptor subtype. Therefore, the treatment choice with an m3 selective agent must be given due consideration, particularly in those with pre-existing cognitive impairment.",35587029

We examined the association between the concurrent use of prescription medications with known risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (mace) (""mace medications"") and the risk of such events among older adults. A multi-center, population-based study from the atherosclerosis risk in communities (aric) study of a cohort of 3669 community-dwelling adults aged 61-86 years with no history of cardiovascular disease who reported the use of at least one medication between september 2006 and august 2013 were followed up until august 2015. Exposure defined as time-varying and time-fixed use of 1, 2 or ≥3 mace medications with non-mace medications serving as negative control. Primary outcome was incident mace defined as coronary artery revascularization, myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiac arrest, or death. In fully adjusted models, there was an increased risk of mace associated with use of 1, 2, or ≥3 mace medications (1 mace: hazards ratio [hr], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.94-1.57); 2 mace: hr 1.89, ci 1.42-2.53; ≥3 mace: hr 2.22, ci 1.61-3.07) compared to use of non-mace medications. These associations persisted in propensity score-matched analyses and among new users of mace medications, never users of cardiovascular medications and subgroups of participants with increased risk of mace. There was no association between the number of non-mace medications used and mace. In this community-based cohort of older adults with no prior cardiovascular disease, the use of mace medications was independently and consistently associated with an increased risk of such events in a dose-response fashion.",35569118

We assessed cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality associated with azithromycin versus amoxicillin-clavulanate among us veterans treated for nonear-nose-throat respiratory infection (""respiratory"") or ear-nose-throat infection indication. Electronic health record data from the us veterans health administration database were used to identify veterans (30-74 years) with outpatient dispensings of oral azithromycin versus amoxicillin-clavulanate for respiratory or ear-nose-throat infection (january 01, 2000-december 31, 2014). Outcomes assessed were risk of cardiovascular death and noncardiovascular death within 1-5 and 6-10 days postdispensing. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted proportional hazards models and binomial regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) and compute risk differences (rd) per million courses of therapy. Cardiac death (subset of cardiovascular death) was assessed in sensitivity analyses. There were 629 345 azithromycin and 168 429 amoxicillin-clavulanate dispensings for respiratory indications, 143 783 azithromycin, and 203 142 amoxicillin-clavulanate dispensings for ear-nose-throat indications.

The choice between these data sources has important implications. We linked ehr from a large academic health system (2015-2017) to medicare insurance claims for patients undergoing surgery. Drug utilization was characterized based on medication order dates in the ehr, and prescription fill dates in medicare claims. We compared opioid use documented in ehr orders to prescription claims in four time periods: 1) baseline (182 days before surgery); 2) perioperative period; 3) discharge date; 4) follow-up (90 days after surgery). We identified 11 128 patients undergoing surgery. During baseline, 34.4% (ehr) versus 44.1% (claims) had evidence of opioid use, and 56.9% of all baseline use was reflected only in one data source. During the perioperative period, 78.8% (ehr) versus 47.6% (claims) had evidence of use. On the day of discharge, 59.6% (ehr) versus 45.5% (claims) had evidence of use, and 51.8% of all discharge use was reflected only in one data source. During follow-up, 4.3% (ehr) versus 10.4% (claims) were identified with prolonged opioid use following surgery with 81.4% of all prolonged use reflected only in one data source. When characterizing opioid exposure, we found substantial discrepancies between ehr medication orders and prescription claims data. In all time periods assessed, most patients' use was reflected only in the ehr, or only in the claims, not both. The potential for misclassification of drug utilization must be evaluated carefully, and choice of data source may have large impacts on key study design elements.",35560685

A case-control study restricted to people with diabetes was performed as part of nationwide register-based finnish study on pd (finpark). We included 2017 cases (diagnosed 1999-2015) with pd and 7934 controls without pd. Diabetes medication use was identified from prescription register (1995-2015) and categorized to insulins, biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (tzds), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) analogues and glinide. Exposure for each medication class was determined as none, at least 3 years before outcome and only within the three-year lag time before pd outcome. The use of insulins, biguanides, sulfonylureas, dpp-4 inhibitors, glp-1 analogues or glinides was not associated with pd. Use of tzds before lag time compared to non-use of tzds (adjusted odds ratio (or) 0.78; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.64-0.95) was associated with decreased risk of pd. Our nationwide case-control study of people with diabetes found no robust evidence on the association between specific diabetes medication classes and risk of pd. Consistent with earlier studies, tzd use was associated with slightly decreased risk of pd. The mechanism for this should be verified in further studies.",35505634

A survey was conducted in 2020 among 300 cyd-tdv prescribers in brazil and thailand to ascertain three success criteria: prescribers' awareness of the materials (receiving and reading them); knowledge of the key messages; and whether their self-reported behaviour regarding practice-related scenarios was aligned with the updated guidance. The armms were not generally effective as <80% of prescribers in both countries met two of the three predefined success criteria. In brazil, 98.7% were aware of the armms whereas in thailand this criterion was fulfilled by 74.0%. Almost all prescribers knew that cyd-tdv was recommended only in individuals with pdi (98.7% and 96.7% in brazil and thailand, respectively). In brazil, where vaccination was restricted to those with a documented history of pdi, 11.3% considered that confirmation should be done through a blood test. More than 75% in both countries considered additional signs of dengue, as early warning signs, and not only those regarded as such by the 2009 who guidelines. These results do not support that the armms were effective as the predefined success criteria were not met. The use of reliable rapid diagnosis tests together with the revised prescribing information and educational materials will facilitate the implementation and compliance with pre-vaccination screening for cyd-tdv eligibility.",35505623

For each analytic method, we compared the average rr (across 2000 replicates) to the known risk ratio (rr) of 1.00. Smrw and drs yielded unbiased results (rr = 0.998 and 0.997, respectively). Tcps matching with replacement was also unbiased (rr = 0.999). Tcps matching without replacement was unbiased when matches were identified starting with patients with the shortest treatment history as initially proposed (rr = 0.999), but it resulted in very slight bias (rr = 0.983) when starting with patients with the longest treatment history. Similarly, creating a match pool without replacement starting with patients with the shortest treatment history yielded an unbiased estimate (rr = 0.997), but matching with the longest treatment history first resulted in substantial bias (rr = 0.903). The most biased strategy was matching after selecting one random comparator observation per individual that continued on the comparator (rr = 0.802). Multiple analytic methods can estimate treatment effects without bias in a pnu cohort. Still, researchers should be wary of introducing bias when selecting controls for complex matching strategies beyond the initially proposed tcps.",35505471

This cross-sectional study of annual trends from 2007 through 2015 used the iqvia pharmetrics® plus for academics data. We identified 165 794 commercially-insured youth 3-18-year-old who had a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and classified them into subgroups with and without disruptive behavior disorders comorbidities. Antipsychotic use, with or without a stimulant, was the primary dependent outcome. Logistic regression estimated the odds of antipsychotic use associated with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders, adjusting for age, sex, study year, and other psychotropic use. Over 70% of the 165 794 youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were 5-14-year-old and male, and 12% had disruptive behavior disorders. Antipsychotic prevalence, with or without a stimulant, was 4.4% in 2007 and 3.4% in 2015. Stimulants with antipsychotics increased significantly from 2007 to 2015 for females (19.5%-28.7%) and youth 15-18-year-old (25.9%-32.7%). Adjusting for age, sex, study year, and other psychotropic use, youth with a comorbid disruptive behavior had a 2.5 (95% ci: 2.3, 2.7) higher likelihood of receiving an antipsychotic than youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and no comorbidities. Antipsychotic use was associated with comorbid disruptive behaviors in youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Administrative health data from ontario, canada was used to measure differences in opioids dispensed and emergency department (ed) visits for opioid-related overdose, poisoning, or substance use following provincial restrictions on access to publicly insured oxycontin (february 29, 2012) and oxyneo (february 28, 2013). This study focused on the cohort of provincial drug insurance eligible people (people 65+ and select low-income populations) who were dispensed oxycodone prior to the restrictions. Difference-in-differences models with a propensity score matched comparison group of people who were dispensed non-oxycodone opioids were used to estimate the main effects. In 6 months following the delisting of oxycontin, milligrams of morphine equivalents (mmes) per person per week for all opioids fell by an average of 7.5% in people dispensed oxycodone relative to the comparison group, and an average of 13.8% in chronic recipients of oxycodone. In the 6 months following the restrictions on oxyneo, mmes per person per week fell by an average of 3.1% in all people dispensed oxycodone, and 25.2% in chronic oxycodone recipients. The decline in oxycodone dispensing among chronic oxycodone recipients corresponded with an increase in dispensing of other opioid formulations, particularly hydromorphone and fentanyl. No important differences were observed for ed visits related to opioid poisoning, overdose, or substance use disorder. Province-wide restrictions on access to long acting oxycodone had an impact on quantities of all opioids dispensed to chronic recipients of oxycodone, but small impacts on the full population of people dispensed oxycodone; the decline in use was partially offset by increases in use of other publicly-funded opioid formulations. This study suggests that policies limiting access to specific prescription opioids led to overall reductions in publicly funded prescription opioid use, particularly in chronic oxycodone recipients, without immediate evidence of changes in opioid-related ed visits.",35470515

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of retail pharmacy opioid sales from 66 jurisdictions between july 2014 and august 2020. We measured monthly population-adjusted rate of opioid units purchased, stratified by development group and country, and used interventional time series analysis to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on rates of opioid purchasing among developed and developing economies separately. Rates of opioid purchasing were generally higher among developed economies, although trends differed considerably by development group. Rates of opioid purchasing declined 23.8% (95% confidence interval [ci] -34.7% to 3.6%) in the 5 years prior to the pandemic in developed economies, but rose 15.2% (95% ci 4.6%-35.6%) among developing economies. In march 2020 there was a short-term increase in the rate of opioid purchases in both developing (10.9 units/1000 population increase; p < 0.0001) and developed (145.5 units/1000 population; p < 0.0001) economies, which was followed immediately by reduced opioid purchasing of a similar scale in april-may 2020 (-14.8 and -171.8 units/1000 population in developing and developed economies, respectively; p < 0.0001).

The use of innovative or repurposed therapies to treat covid-19 patients is widespread; however, there are very limited data regarding the patterns of use and safety profile of most of these therapeutics in pregnant women. We assessed the patterns of use of covid-19 therapeutics during pregnancy using data from the international registry of coronavirus in pregnancy (ircep). The ircep is an international observational cohort study intended to assess the risk of major obstetric and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with covid-19. Women enrolled while pregnant or within 6 months after end of pregnancy. Follow-up for women enrolled while pregnant includes monthly online questionnaires throughout the pregnancy and, for live births, through the infant's first 90 days of life. Participants provide information on demographic characteristics, health history, covid-19 tests and symptoms, medications, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. A total of 5780 women with covid-19 during pregnancy were identified from the ircep. Severity of covid-19 was classified in 372 of them as severe, 3053 moderate, and 2355 mild. The most frequently reported covid-19 therapies, other than analgesics, included azithromycin (12.8%), steroids (3.5%), interferon (2.4%), oseltamivir (2.1%), chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (1.7%), anticoagulants (2.0%), antibodies (0.9%), and remdesivir (0.3%). Most drugs were preferentially used for severe cases. Patterns of use varied by country. Ircep participants reported use of therapeutics for covid-19 during pregnancy for which there is little safety information.

These methods implicitly assume that all patients will experience the event (medication discontinuation), which may bias the estimation of persistence if long-term medication persistent patients rate is expected in the population. We aimed to introduce a mixture cure model in the medication persistence analysis to describe the characteristics of long-term and short-term persistent patients, and demonstrate its application using a real-world data analysis. A cohort of new users of statins was used to demonstrate the differences between the standard survival model and the mixture cure model in the medication persistence analysis. The mixture cure model estimated effects of variables, reported as odds ratios (or) associated with likelihood of being long-term persistent and effects of variables, reported as hazard ratios (hr) associated with time to medication discontinuation among short-term persistent patients. Long-term persistent rate was estimated as 17% for statin users aged between 45 and 55 versus 10% for age less than 45 versus 4% for age greater than 55 via the mixture cure model. The hr of covariates estimated by the standard survival model (hr = 1.41, 95% ci = [1.35, 1.48]) were higher than those estimated by the mixture cure model (hr = 1.32, 95% ci = [1.25, 1.39]) when comparing patients with age greater than 55 to those between 45 and 55.

We followed them for up to 30 days after their second dose of an mrna vaccine to identify encounters for myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis. We compared two identification methods: a method that searched all encounter diagnoses using a brief text description (e.g., icd-10-cm code i40.9 is defined as 'acute myocarditis, unspecified'). We searched the text description of all inpatient or outpatient encounter diagnoses (in any position) for ""myocarditis"" or ""pericarditis."" the other method was developed by the centers for disease control and prevention's vaccine safety datalink (vsd), which searched for emergency department visits or hospitalizations with a select set of discharge icd-10-cm diagnosis codes. For both methods, two physicians independently reviewed the identified patient records and classified them as confirmed, probable or not cases using the cdc's case definition. The encounter methodology identified 14 distinct patients who met the confirmed or probable cdc case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis with an onset within 21 days of receipt of covid-19 vaccination. When we extended the search for relevant diagnoses to 30 days since vaccination, we identified two additional patients (for a total of 16 patients) who met the case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis, but those patients had been misdiagnosed at the time of their original presentation. Three of these patients had an icd-10-cm code of i51.4 ""myocarditis, unspecified;"" that code was omitted by the vsd algorithm (in the late fall of 2021). The vsd methodology identified 11 patients who met the cdc case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis. Seven (64%) of the 11 patients had initial care for myopericarditis outside of a kpnw facility and their diagnosis could not be ascertained by the vsd methodology until claims were submitted (median delay of 33 days; range of 12-195 days). Among those who received a second dose of vaccine (n = 146 785), we estimated a risk as 95.4 cases of myopericarditis per million second doses administered (95% ci, 52.1-160.0). We identified additional valid cases of myopericarditis following an mrna vaccination that would be missed by the vsd's search algorithm, which depends on select hospital discharge diagnosis codes. The true incidence of myopericarditis is markedly higher than the incidence reported to us advisory committees in the fall of 2021. The vsd should validate its search algorithm to improve its sensitivity for myopericarditis.",35404496

Different ways of handling medication are required depending on the research questions and whether the affected measurement is the exposure, the outcome, or a confounder. This study aimed to review handling of medication use in observational research. Pubmed was searched for etiological studies published between 2015 and 2019 in 15 high-ranked journals from cardiology, diabetes, and epidemiology. We selected studies that analyzed blood pressure, glucose, or lipid measurements (whether exposure, outcome or confounder) by linear or logistic regression. Two reviewers independently recorded how medication use was handled and assessed whether the methods used were in accordance with the research aim. We reported the methods used per variable category (exposure, outcome, confounder). A total of 127 articles were included. Most studies did not perform any method to account for medication use (exposure 58%, outcome 53%, and confounder 45%). Restriction (exposure 22%, outcome 23%, and confounders 10%), or adjusting for medication use using a binary indicator were also used frequently (exposure: 18%, outcome: 19%, confounder: 45%). No advanced methods were applied. In 60% of studies, the methods' validity could not be judged due to ambiguous reporting of the research aim. Invalid approaches were used in 28% of the studies, mostly when the affected variable was the outcome (36%). Many studies ambiguously stated the research aim and used invalid methods to handle medication use. Researchers should consider a valid methodological approach based on their research question.",35384126

Using healthverity chargemaster and claims data, we selected patients hospitalized with covid-19 between april 2020 and february 2021, and classified them by severity at admission using an algorithm we developed based on respiratory support requirements (supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, o2/niv, invasive mechanical ventilation, imv, or neither). To evaluate the utility of the algorithm, patients were followed from admission until death, discharge, or a 28-day maximum to report mortality risks and rates overall and by stratified by severity. Trends for heterogeneity in mortality risk and rate across severity classifications were evaluated using cochran-armitage and logrank trend tests, respectively. Among 118 117 patients, the algorithm categorized patients in increasing severity as neither (36.7%), o2/niv (54.3%), and imv (9.0%). Associated mortality risk (and 95% ci) was 11.8% (11.6-12.0%) overall and increased with severity [3.4% (3.2-3.5%), 11.5% (11.3-11.8%), 47.3% (46.3-48.2%); p < 0.001]. Mortality rate per 1000 person-days (and 95% ci) was 15.1 (14.9-15.4) overall and increased with severity [5.7 (5.4-6.0), 14.5 (14.2-14.9), 32.7 (31.8-33.6); p < 0.001]. As expected, we observed a positive association between the algorithm-defined severity on admission and 28-day mortality risk and rate.

For all analyses except for neural tube defects (ntds), we classified mothers who reported influenza vaccination 1 month before through the third pregnancy month as exposed; the exposure window for ntds was 1 month before through the first pregnancy month. For defects with five or more exposed case children, we used logistic regression to estimate propensity score-adjusted odds ratios (aors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis), adjusting for estimated delivery year and season; plurality; maternal age, race/ethnicity, smoking and alcohol use, low folate intake; and, for ntds, folate antagonist medications. There were 334 (4.1%) case and 197 (4.0%) control mothers who reported influenza vaccination from 1 month before through the third pregnancy month. Adjusted ors ranged from 0.53 for omphalocele to 1.74 for duodenal atresia/stenosis. Most aors (11 of 19) were ≤1 and all adjusted cis included the null.

It is important to prioritise critical product defects for review to ensure that prompt risk mitigation actions are taken. A regulatory risk impact prioritisation model for product defects (rismed) with 11 factors considering the seriousness and extent of impact of a defect was developed. The model generated an overall score that categorised cases into high, medium or low impact. The model was further developed into a statistical risk scoring model (stat-rismed) using multivariate logistic regression that classified cases into high and non-high impact. Both models were evaluated against an expert-derived gold standard annotation corpus and tested on an independent dataset. Product defect cases received from january 2011 to june 2020 (n = 660) were used to train stat-rismed and cases from july 2020 to june 2021 (n = 220) for validation. The stat-rismed identified four factors associated with high impact cases, namely defect classification based on meddra-hsa terms, therapeutic indication of product, detectability of defect and whether any overseas regulatory actions were performed. Compared to rismed, stat-rismed achieved an improved sensitivity (94% vs 42%) and positive predictive value (47% vs 43%) for the identification of high impact cases, against the gold standard labels. This study reported characteristics that predicts cases with high impact, and the use of a statistical model to identify such cases. The model may potentially be applied to prioritise product defect issues and strengthen overall surveillance efforts of substandard medicines.",35366030

Patients diagnosed with hiv within the infectious disease clinic at the atlanta veterans affairs medical center from 1/1/2002 to 8/5/2017 were eligible. Patients were included if they had any of the following: encounters with a diagnosis for ak (international classification of diseases [icd]-9: 702.0; icd-10: l57.0), procedural codes for destruction of premalignant lesions (current procedural terminology [cpt]: 17000, 17003, and 17004), and prescriptions for topical 5-fluorouracil. Ppv and binomial 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Ppv was 91.9% (89.1-94.7) for 369 encounters with an ak diagnosis. For procedural codes, ppv was 52.6% (48.1-57.2) for 454 encounters with destruction of 1 pre-malignant lesion, 63.7% (58.4-68.9) for 322 encounters with destruction of 2-14 lesions, and 57.7% (38.7-76.7) for 26 encounters with destruction of 15+ lesions. Ppv was 72.9% (63.5-82.4) for 85 encounters with a prescription of topical 5-fluorouracil. Ak diagnosis codes are appropriate to use in epidemiologic and health policy research among people living with hiv and may be more reliable than destruction of pre-malignant lesion cpt codes.",35297128

This was a repeated cross-sectional study using monthly national pharmacy claims data, to examine trend changes in the prevalence of valproate use among wcbp pre and post two separate regulatory events in december 2014 and april 2018. Annual population estimates from the central statistics office were used to calculate the prevalence rate per 1000 eligible women. Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series with negative binomial regression was used to examine rates for wcbp aged 16-44 years, and by 10-year age groups. Prevalence ratios (pr) are presented with 95% confidence intervals (cis). Among wcbp aged 16-44 years, there was no statistically significant change in the month-to-month prevalence ratio in the post- compared to pre-december 2014 intervention period. A significant decline was, however, observed in the post-, compared to pre-april 2018 intervention period (pr = 0.998, [95% cis: 0.996, 1.000]; p = 0.029). Among those aged 16-24 years, a significant decreasing trend in the month-to-month prevalence ratio was found in the post- compared to pre-december 2014 intervention period (pr = 0.991, [95% cis: 0.984, 0.998];p <0.01). A marginal effect was observed in the post- compared to pre-april 2018 intervention period for those aged 25-34 years (pr = 0.996, [95% cis: 0.992, 1.000]; p = 0.048). Although no evidence of change was observed following the december 2014 intervention period, a significant decline in the prevalence ratio of valproate use was observed after the 2018 intervention, which may reflect the introduction of the most recent contraindication measures.",35285110

Concurrent use of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) with citalopram or escitalopram may potentiate the qt-prolonging effects of these selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors through pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interactions. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the u.s. Renal data system (2007-2017) and a new-user design to examine the differential risk of sudden cardiac death (scd) associated with citalopram/escitalopram initiation vs. Sertraline initiation in the presence and absence of ppi use among adults receiving hemodialysis. We studied 72 559 patients:14 983 (21%) citalopram/escitalopram initiators using a ppi; 26 503 (36%) citalopram/escitalopram initiators not using a ppi;10 779 (15%) sertraline initiators using a ppi; and 20 294 (28%) sertraline initiators not using a ppi (referent). The outcome of interest was 1-year scd. We used inverse probability of treatment weighted survival models to estimate weighted hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis). Compared with sertraline initiators not using a ppi, citalopram/escitalopram initiators using a ppi had the numerically highest risk of scd (hr [95% ci] = 1.31 [1.11-1.54]), followed by citalopram/escitalopram initiators not using a ppi (hr [95% ci] = 1.22 [1.06-1.41]). Sertraline initiators using a ppi had a similar risk of scd compared with those not using a ppi (hr [95% ci] = 1.03 [0.85-1.26]). Existing ppi use may elevate the risk of scd associated with citalopram or escitalopram initiation among hemodialysis patients.",35285107

Two cohort studies using a u.s. Medical claims database from 2002 to 2019 including npdr patients 18 years or older. A risk factor analysis performed a time-updating cox regression model assessing statin usage. A second new-user active comparator design analysis replicating a previously published study. Main outcomes included a new diagnosis of vtdr (composite of either pdr or dme) or dme and pdr individually for the risk factor study and included additional outcomes of new dr, npdr, vitreous hemorrhage (vh) and tractional retinal detachment (trd) for the new user study. Risk factor analysis included 66 617 statin users with npdr at baseline and 83 365 nonstatin users. Of these, 27 325 (18.2%) progressed to vtdr, 4086 (2.71%) progressed to pdr, and 22 750 (15.1%) progressed to dme. After multivariable analysis, no protective effect of statin use was found for progression to vtdr, pdr, or dme (hr = 1.01-3, p >0.33 for all comparisons). Replicated new user design analysis also showed no protective effect for statins on risk of development of dr (hr = 1.03, 95% ci: 0.99-1.07, p = 0.13), pdr (hr = 0.89, 95% ci: 0.79-1.02, p = 0.09), dme (hr = 0.94, 95% ci: 0.86-1.03, p = 0.21), vh (hr = 1.00, 95% ci: 0.86-1.16, p = 0.99), and trd (hr = 1.11, 95% ci: 0.89-1.38, p = 0.36). Statin use was found not to be protective for progression of dr regardless of study methodology. These results suggest that the specifics of the population studied rather than differing study methodology are important in assessing the effect of statins on dr progression.",35253307

The purpose of this narrative review is to examine evidence from studies evaluating the patient or public health impact of federal and state opioid analgesic prescribing guidelines and laws, describe gaps and challenges in current research, and highlight opportunities for improving future research. We focused on evidence from a literature review covering 2013 through 2019. We identified 30 studies evaluating opioid analgesic thresholds based on federal policies and guidelines, state laws, and medicaid state plans that attempt to influence the course of patient care at or when the limit is exceeded (e.g., prior authorization). Most studies evaluated changes in prescribing or dispensing patterns of opioid analgesics, largely finding decreases in prescribing after policy enactment. Fewer studies evaluated patient or public health outcomes beyond changes in prescribing and dispensing patterns; results were infrequently stratified by potentially important sociodemographic and clinical factors. No studies assessed the potential for adverse patient outcomes for which we have emerging evidence of harms. We describe knowledge gaps and propose opportunities for future research to sufficiently assess the potential impact and unintended consequences of opioid analgesic prescribing laws, regulations, guidelines, and policies.",35247021

While lab-based nucleic acid amplification testing (naat) is often considered the gold standard to detect sars-cov-2 in the community, results typically take 2-7 days to return, rendering poc testing a critical diagnostic tool for infection control. The national football league (nfl) and nfl players association deployed a new poc testing strategy using a newly available reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) rapid test during the 2020 season, and evaluated diagnostic effectiveness compared to other available devices using real-world population surveillance data. Rt-pcr poc test results were compared to naat results from same-day samples by calculation of positive and negative concordance. Sensitivity analyses were performed for three subgroups: (1) individuals symptomatic at time of positive test; (2) individuals tested during the pilot phase of rollout; and (3) individuals tested daily. Among 4989 same-day poc/naat pairs, 4957 (99.4%) were concordant, with 93.1% positive concordance and 99.6% negative concordance. Based on adjudicated case status, the false negative rate was 0.2% and false positive rate was 2.9%. In 43 instances, the immediate turnaround of results by poc allowed isolation of infected individuals 1 day sooner than lab-based testing. Positive/negative concordance in sensitivity analyses were relatively stable. Rt-pcr poc testing provided timely results that were highly concordant with lab-based naat in population surveillance. Expanded use of effective rt-pcr poc can enable rapid isolation of infected individuals and reduce covid-19 infection in the community.",35225407

The target population for this study was 366 randomly selected hospitalized patients with possible cases of ais, defined as relevant icd-10 codes and diagnostic imaging and prescription or surgical procedure, in three institutions between april 1, 2015 and march 31, 2017. We determined the positive predictive values (ppvs) of these identification algorithms based on comparisons with a gold standard consisting of chart reviews by experienced specialist physicians. Additionally, the sensitivities of them among 166 patients with the possible cases of ais at a single institution were evaluated. The ppvs were 0.618 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.566-0.667) to 0.909 (95% ci: 0.708-0.989) and progressively increased with adding or limiting information on ais therapeutic procedures as ""and"" condition in the identification algorithms. The ppvs for identification algorithms based on diagnostic codes i63.x were >0.8. However, the sensitivities progressively decreased to a maximum of ~0.2 after adding information on ais therapeutic procedures as ""and"" condition. The identification algorithms based on the combination of appropriate icd-10 diagnostic codes in dpc data and other ais treatment factors may be useful to studies for ais at a national level using mid-net®.",35224801

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the us medicare claims research database (2006-2015) in adults aged ≥65 years with pd claims. Other apd initiators were randomly matched (4:1) to rasagiline initiators on age, sex, and cohort entry year. Cutaneous melanoma events were identified by a validated claims algorithm. Incidence rates (irs), incidence rate ratios (irrs), and cox-adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) for melanoma comparing rasagiline with other apd initiators were calculated and analyzed by duration of study medication use and cumulative dose of rasagiline. Potential indicators of surveillance bias were explored. Among 23 708 rasagiline initiators and 96 552 matched apd initiators, the crude ir of melanoma/100 000 person-years was 334.3 (95% confidence interval [ci], 291.5-381.6) and 208.2 (95% ci, 190.1-227.5), respectively (crude irr 1.61; 95% ci, 1.36-1.89). The adjusted hr was 1.37 (95% ci, 1.14-1.65) and increased with longer rasagiline exposure and higher cumulative rasagiline doses. Rasagiline initiators more frequently had dermatologist visits or skin biopsies before cohort entry than apd initiators and had a higher incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer during follow-up (crude irr, 1.44; 95% ci, 1.35-1.54). A small increased incidence of melanoma with exposure to rasagiline compared with other apds was observed. Although the pattern with dose and duration is consistent with a hypothesized biologic effect, the increased skin cancer surveillance among rasagiline users suggests surveillance bias as a contributing explanation for the observed results.",35224798

Patients who visited the queen mary hospital in 2005-2018 with ild were identified using the following icd-9 codes: post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (ppf; icd-9: 515), idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (ifa; icd-9: 516.3), connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (ctd-ild; icd-9: 517.2, 517.8, 714.81), sarcoidosis (icd-9: 135) and extrinsic allergic alveolitis (eaa; icd-9: 495). A random selection was conducted in cases with diagnostic code of ppf and ifa, where a relative higher case number was identified. All the cases of ctd-ild, sarcoidosis and eaa were included in validation for relatively small case number. Two hundred and sixty nine cases were validated using medical record review by a respiratory specialist. The overall positive predictive value (ppv) was 79% (95% ci, 74%-84%).

Therefore, the pattern of medication use should be monitored routinely. The aim of this study was to investigate the population-based prevalence of polypharmacy and the patterns of medication use in southwestern iran. We also investigated correlates between polypharmacy and patterns of medication use. Data from the khuzestan comprehensive health study (kchs) which consists information of 30 506 with age range to 20 to 65 years were used. Crude and age-standardized prevalence of polypharmacy and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated for different subpopulations. Multivariable poisson regression modeling was applied, and adjusted prevalence ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated. The anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system (first and second levels) was used for drug classification in different groups based on age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Out of 30 506 adults, 93.3% were not on any medications, and age- and gender-standardized prevalence of polypharmacy was 0.24%. The lowest estimated prevalence was among arab participants (0.13%). The prevalence of polypharmacy was 1.57% among elderly people, and 4.78% among patients with heart diseases. Socioeconomic status was not associated with polypharmacy (prevalence ratio: 0.95; p = 0.573) but was significantly associated with patterns of medications use for alimentary tract and metabolism and nervous system diseases. The most common drug classes were cardiovascular system (3.93%), alimentary tract and metabolism (2.79%), nervous system (1.01%), systemic hormonal preparations (0.69%), and blood and blood-forming organs (0.38%). The prevalence of polypharmacy is very low in khuzestan province, especially in the arab population.

This study aimed to determine whether the use of tramadol is associated with the occurrence of seizures. We conducted a case-case-time-control (cctc) study by identifying patients who had received tramadol and seizure diagnosis in a nationwide healthcare database in south korea between 2003 and 2015. Each case was matched for age and sex to one future case to adjust for time trends in exposure without selection bias from the use of an external control group. The use of tramadol was assessed during a risk period of 1-30 days, and two reference periods, 61-90 days and 91-120 days, preceding the first diagnosis of seizures. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (aor) by dividing the or in cases (case-crossover) by the or in future cases (control-crossover). We performed a dose-response analysis using the average daily dose. We identified 2523 incident cases with matched future cases (mean age, 45.4 years; 50% men). The aor for seizure with tramadol use was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.98-1.43) in the cctc analysis, with a case-crossover or of 1.19 (0.98-1.43) and control-crossover or of 1.27 (1.03-1.56).

More data on the diagnostic stability is needed to appraise epidemiological findings from such studies. Using health claims data of the years 2004-2016 from the german pharmacoepidemiological research database, 160 273 patients aged ≥50 with incident dementia were identified and followed for 4 years. According to the incident icd-10 codes patients were assigned to the categories ad, vd or od. Changes between categories during follow-up were calculated. Overall, 18.8% had incident ad (vd: 21.5%, od: 59.7%). Fifteen thousand eight hundred forty-two patients had only one dementia diagnosis during 4 years (ad: 7.4%, vd: 12.4%, od: 9.8%). Among those with more than one diagnosis, the incident diagnosis matched the last diagnosis in 65.1% (ad), 53.9% (vd) and 73.8% (od) of patients. Changes in the diagnostic category were higher in patients with ad (mean: 5.1) than in patients with vd (3.6) or od (3.3).

Our goal was to quantify the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions in drug prescriptions at danish hospitals, estimate the risk of adverse outcomes associated with discouraged drug combinations, and highlight the patient types (defined by the primary diagnosis of the admission) that appear to be more affected. This cross-sectional (descriptive part) and cohort study (adverse outcomes part) used hospital electronic health records from two danish regions (~2.5 million people) from january 2008 through june 2016. We included all inpatients receiving two or more medications during their admission and considered concomitant prescriptions of potentially interacting drugs as per the danish drug interaction database. We measured the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions in general and discouraged drug pairs in particular during admissions and associations with adverse outcomes: post-discharge all-cause mortality rate, readmission rate and length-of-stay. Among 2 886 227 hospital admissions (945 475 patients; median age 62 years [iqr: 41-74]; 54% female; median number of drugs 7 [iqr: 4-11]), patients in 1 836 170 admissions were exposed to at least one potential drug-drug interaction (659 525 patients; median age 65 years [iqr: 49-77]; 54% female; median number of drugs 9 [iqr: 6-13]) and in 27 605 admissions to a discouraged drug pair (18 192 patients; median age 68 years [iqr: 58-77]; female 46%; median number of drugs 16 [iqr: 11-22]).

Our ga algorithm was developed against a validated delivery-based ga algorithm in live-births, implemented within a sample of chart-confirmed stillbirths, and compared to national estimates of ga at stillbirth. Our algorithm, including fertility procedures and 11 prenatal tests, assigned a ga at delivery to 97.9% of live-births and 92.6% of stillbirths. For live-births (n = 4 701 207), it estimated ga within 2 weeks of a reference delivery-based ga algorithm in 82.5% of pregnancies, with a mean difference of 3.7 days. In chart-confirmed stillbirths (n = 49), it estimated ga within 2 weeks of the clinically recorded ga at delivery for 80% of pregnancies, with a mean difference of 11.1 days. Implementation of the algorithm in a cohort of stillbirths (n = 40 484) had an increased percentage of deliveries after 36 weeks compared to national estimates. In a population of primarily commercially-insured pregnant women, fertility procedures and prenatal tests can estimate ga with sufficient sensitivity and accuracy for utility in pregnancy studies.",35122354

All ema-requested pas, commonly observational studies, must be recorded in this register. Multi-database studies (mds) leveraging secondary data have become an important strategy to conduct pas in recent years, as reflected by the type of studies registered in the eu pas register. To analyse and describe pas in the eu pas register, with focus on mds. Studies in the eu pas register from inception to 31st december 2018 were described concerning transparency, regulatory obligations, scope, study type (e.g., observational study, clinical trial, survey, systematic review/meta-analysis), study design, type of data collection and target population. Mds were defined as studies conducted through secondary use of >1 data source not linked at patient-level. Data extraction was carried out independently by 14 centres with expertise in pharmacoepidemiology, using publicly available information in the eu pas register including study protocol, whenever available, using a standardised data collection form. For validation purposes, a second revision of key fields for a 15% random sample of studies was carried out by a different centre. The inter-rater reliability (irr) was then calculated. Finally, to identify predictors of primary data collection-based studies/versus those based on secondary use of healthcare databases) or mds (vs. Non-mds), odds ratios (or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) were calculated fitting univariate logistic regression models. Overall, 1426 studies were identified. Clinical trials (n = 30; 2%), systematic reviews/meta-analyses (n = 16; 1%) and miscellaneous study designs (n = 46; 3%) were much less common than observational studies (n = 1227; 86%). The protocol was available for 63% (n = 360) of 572 observational studies requested by a competent authority. Overall, 36% (n = 446) of observational studies were based fully or partially on primary data collection. Of 757 observational studies based on secondary use of data alone, 282 (37%) were mds. Drug utilisation was significantly more common as a study scope in mds compared to non-mds studies. The overall percentage agreement among collaborating centres that collected the data concerning study variables was highest for study type (93.5%) and lowest for type of secondary data (67.8%). Observational studies were the most common type of studies in the eu pas register, but 30% used primary data, which is more resource-intensive. Almost half of observational studies using secondary data were mds. Data recording in the eu pas register may be improved further, including more widespread availability of study protocols to improve transparency.",35092329

In practice, reporting of these decisions is inconsistent and this can undermine the transparency, and reproducibility of results obtained. We illustrate reporting tools, graphical displays and sensitivity analyses to increase transparency and facilitate evaluation of the robustness of analyses involving hdps. Using a study from the uk clinical practice research datalink that implemented hdps we demonstrate the application of the proposed recommendations. We identify seven considerations surrounding the implementation of hdps, such as the identification of data dimensions, method for code prioritisation and number of variables selected. Graphical diagnostic tools include assessing the balance of key confounders before and after adjusting for empirically selected hdps covariates and the identification of potentially influential covariates. Sensitivity analyses include varying the number of covariates selected and assessing the impact of covariates behaving empirically as instrumental variables. In our example, results were robust to both the number of covariates selected and the inclusion of potentially influential covariates. Furthermore, our hdps models achieved good balance in key confounders. The data-adaptive approach of hdps and the resulting benefits have led to its popularity as a method for confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiological studies. Reporting of hdps analyses in practice may be improved by the considerations and tools proposed here to increase the transparency and reproducibility of study results.",35092316

Several disease-modifying therapies (dmts) are fda-approved to slow disease progression, but are not indicated for use during pregnancy. Our objective was to describe trends over time (2010-2019) in monthly point prevalence of dmt use among reproductive-age women, overall and by generic name. This study used administrative claims data from the us during 2009-2019 to identify women age 15-44 with ms and continuous insurance coverage for ≥12 months. Dmts were identified using prescription fills and procedural claims for alemtuzumab, daclizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, glatiramer acetate, interferon beta, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and teriflunomide. Monthly prevalent use was defined as ≥1 days' supply of a dmt in the month. Age- and region-standardized monthly prevalence was estimated nonparametrically. Among 42 281 reproductive-aged women over 818 179 person-months, dmt use increased from a minimum monthly prevalence of 49.3% (february, 2011) to a maximum of 58.7% (april, 2019). In 2010, prevalence of injectable dmts was 43.1% compared to 2.5% for oral dmts; by 2014, however, oral dmts (26.5%) surpassed injectable dmts (23.7%) as the most common route of administration. In the most recent data available (december, 2019), the most common dmts were dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, and fingolimod. Dmt use among reproductive-aged women has rapidly evolved during the past decade. Collaborative treatment decision making between women with ms and clinicians may help optimize ms care and improve dmt uptake during reproductive years.",35088492

Mathematically we demonstrate how a standard sampling of controls, where controls are sampled among all subjects without an event at end-of-study, leads to a biased effect estimate. We propose to add the requirement that controls initiate treatment before the calendar time of event of their matched case to circumvent this. The standard and proposed sampling methods are compared in a simulation study and in an empirical data example examining the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage on the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. When the controls are sampled the standard way, the case-time-control design confers a bias because cases and controls have a different time-trend of exposure. The bias has been upwards in all the scenarios we have investigated. The requirement we add to be a potential control ensures that cases and controls have the same time-trend of exposure when treatment and outcome are independent. The simulation study confirms that the proposed sampling method removes the bias between treatment and outcome. The proposed sampling method lowered the odds-ratio estimate from 3.72 to 3.26 in the data example. The proposed sampling method makes it possible to use the case-time-control design in a cohort of subjects with registered use of a drug when outcome prevents further treatment.",35088482

The evaluation of anti-seizure drugs (asd) strategies and identification of drps are rarely studied. This study aimed primarily to evaluate the choice of asd according to international guidelines and secondarily to identify and describe anti-seizure drug-related problems. A cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 year among lebanese adults with epilepsy attending neurology clinics. The choice of asd was compared to national institute for health and care excellence guidelines. Drug-drug interactions were evaluated by the lexicomp database, and the drp classification was performed using the pharmaceutical care network europe classification. A total of 404 patients with epilepsy were included. The prescription for an asd was in accordance with the indication set in guidelines in 75.0% of population, and 1078 drps were identified. The main drps detected were adverse drug reactions (51.0%), inappropriate combinations of drugs (50.0%), and suboptimal drug regimens (46.3%). Single and divorced patients, who living in mount lebanon, and who took the old with the new generation had a less risk to have an inadequate prescription to guidelines. However, female gender, controlled epilepsy, multiple asds, and living in a rural region increased drps. This study showed that quarter of the population used asds contraindicated according to international guidelines. Since drps were related to the number and type of asd prescribed, it is important to assess the case of each patient by a clinical pharmacist to prevent drug-drug interactions and iatrogenic issues.",35084792

This study was aimed at assessing the impact of this decision on the overall use of pregabalin in saudi arabia and in comparison with drugs prescribed to treat neuropathic pain (i.e., vs. Gabapentin, tramadol, duloxetine, and amitriptyline). This was an interrupted time-series analysis of the saudi quarterly sale data of the study drugs from october/2015 to september/2020. These data were obtained from iqvia and were converted into use estimates (defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitant-days [ddd/tid]). Segmented regression models were conducted to assess the direct (level) and prolonged (trend) changes in use data after the decision. All analyses were completed using rstudio version 1.4.1103. Before the sfda's decision, there was an increased quarter-to-quarter use of pregabalin (ddd/tid: 0.16; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.04 to 0.28). Pregabalin overall use dropped sharply by -1.85 ddd/tid (95% ci -2.71 to -0.99) directly after the decision with a prolonged quarter-to-quarter declining effect (ddd/tid: -0.22, ci to -0.37 to -0.05). The decision was associated with a direct increase in the use of gabapentin by 0.62 ddd/tid (95% ci 0.52-0.72) without any impact on the use of other drugs. The results of our study showed that the sfda decision was associated with a decrease in the overall use of pregabalin, which may help minimize the risk of its abuse and misuse.",35049110

While no different from other forms of confounding in theory, confounding by indication often requires specific methods to address the bias it creates in addition to common epidemiological adjustment or restriction methods. Clinical indication influencing treatment prescription is patient-specific and complex, making it challenging to measure within nonexperimental research. Restriction of the study population to patients with the indication for treatment would effectively mitigate confounding by indication and bring about comparability between exposure and comparator populations with respect to probability of the exposure. Active comparators are often an effective practical solution to restrict the study population in this manner when indication cannot be measured accurately. This article discusses various forms of confounding by indication, the utility of active comparators for nonexperimental studies of treatment effects, and the active comparator, new user (acnu) study design to implicitly condition on indication. Considerations for selecting active comparators and conducting an acnu study design are discussed to enable increased adoption of these methods, improve quality of nonexperimental studies, and ultimately strengthen our evidence base for intended and unintended treatment effects in relevant target populations.",35019190

The benefits of sglt-2i from cardiovascular outcome trials may lead to preferential prescribing of sglt-2i to patients at high cardiovascular risk, possibly causing confounding in non-randomized studies of sglt-2i as first-line treatment. We assessed evolving imbalances in characteristics of patients starting sglt-2i versus metformin as first-line monotherapy. Using claims data from two us commercial health insurance and medicare, we identified patients with t2d aged ≥18 years (>65 years in medicare) initiating first-line sglt-2i or metformin from 2013 through 2019. Standardized differences (sds) for patient characteristics were assessed during four consecutive calendar time blocks (t1:4/2013-12/2014; t2:1/2015-6/2016; t3:7/2016-12/2017; and t4:1/2018-12/2019). We also estimated the propensity score of receiving sglt-2i versus metformin within each time block and evaluated time trends in model discrimination with c-statistics. We identified 9113 initiators of first-line sglt-2i and 810 348 initiators of first-line metformin. During t1, sglt-2i initiators were younger (sd = -0.24) and less likely to have seen cardiologists (-0.07) with a similar prevalence of cvd (0.04) compared with metformin. During t4, patients were more balanced for age (-0.01). Cardiologist visits (0.08) and cvd (0.25) became more prevalent among sglt-2i initiators. When comparing initiators of first-line sglt-2i versus metformin, imbalances in patient characteristics evolved from 2013 through 2019, particularly channeling sglt-2i to individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Evolving channeling in prescribing first-line sglt-2i should be expected and accounted for in non-randomized comparative effectiveness research.",34985178

Accordingly, this work aimed to quantify the effect of the decision of a hospital of including a more expensive me-too antidepressant in its hdf. A controlled longitudinal study was carried out in a regional health service of spain. We performed a segmented regression analysis with control group. We used the following dependent variables: defined daily doses (ddd) per 1000 inhabitants per day, ddd per 100 bed days, and cost per ddd. At a hospital level, the modification in the formulary led to utilization changes: (1) an increase in immediate consumption of the newly included me-too drug; and, (2) an annual 25.96% [95% ci: 2.96%-48.95%] decrease in the adjusted trend of the already existing parent antidepressant. The adjusted trend of the cost per ddd of the sum of all medications in the therapeutic group increased by 20.03% annually [95% ci: 3.24%-36.82%]. In the out-of-hospital setting utilization changes were: (1) the adjusted trend of the newly included me-too drug rose by 12.14% annually [95% ci: 4.97%-19.30%]; and, (2) that of the parent drug underwent a negative change in trend of 4.18% annually [95% ci: 0.00%-8.36%].

The availability of data sources is the first step for conducting dur. However, documents that systematize these data sources in latin american (latam) countries are not known. We compiled the potential data sources for dur in the latam region. A network of dur experts from nine latam countries was assembled and experts conducted: (i) a website search of the government, academic, and private health institutions; (ii) screening of eligible data sources, and (iii) liaising with national experts in pharmacoepidemiology (via an online survey). The data sources were characterized by accessibility, geographic granularity, setting, sector of the data, sources and type of the data. Descriptive analyses were performed. We identified 125 data sources for dur in nine latam countries. Thirty-eight (30%) of them were publicly and conveniently available; 89 (71%) were accessible with limitations, and 18 (14%) were not accessible or lacked clear rules for data access. From the 125 data sources, 76 (61%) were from the public sector only; 46 (37%) were from pharmacy records; 43 (34%) came from ambulatory settings and; 85 (68%) gave access to individual patient-level data. Although multiple sources for dur are available in latam countries, the accessibility is a major challenge.

However, variable selection and unmeasured confounding are particularly challenging when analyzing large healthcare data. Machine learning methods may help address these challenges. The objective was to evaluate the capacity of such methods to select confounders and reduce unmeasured confounding bias. A simulation study with known true effects was conducted. Completely synthetic and partially synthetic data incorporating real large healthcare data were generated. We compared bayesian adjustment for confounding (bac), generalized bayesian causal effect estimation (gbcee), group lasso and doubly robust estimation, high-dimensional propensity score (hdps), and scalable collaborative targeted maximum likelihood algorithms. For the hdps, two adjustment approaches targeting the effect in the whole population were considered: full matching and inverse probability weighting. In scenarios without hidden confounders, most methods were essentially unbiased. The bias and variance of the hdps varied considerably according to the number of variables selected by the algorithm. In scenarios with hidden confounders, substantial bias reduction was achieved by using machine-learning methods to identify proxies as compared to adjusting only by observed confounders. Hdps and group lasso performed poorly in the partially synthetic simulation. Bac, gbcee, and scalable collaborative-targeted maximum likelihood algorithms performed particularly well. Machine learning can help to identify measured confounders in large healthcare databases. They can also capitalize on proxies of unmeasured confounders to substantially reduce residual confounding bias.",34953160

We included adverse event reports from the manufacturer and user facility device experience database from january 2005 to june 2018 related to device removal following hysteroscopic sterilization. We used an iterative process to develop an annotation model that extracts six categories of desired information and applied the annotation model to train an nlp algorithm. We assessed the model performance using positive predictive value (ppv, also known as precision), sensitivity (also known as recall), and f  score (a combined measure of ppv and sensitivity). Using extracted variables, we summarized the reporting source, the presence of prespecified and other patient and device events, additional sterilizations and other procedures performed, and time from implantation to removal. The overall f  score was 91.5% for labeled items and 93.9% for distinct events after excluding duplicates. A total of 16 535 reports of device removal were analyzed. The most frequently reported patient and device events were abdominal/pelvic/genital pain (n = 13 166, 79.6%) and device dislocation/migration (n = 3180, 19.2%), respectively. Of those reporting an additional sterilization procedure, the majority had a hysterectomy or salpingectomy (n = 7932). One-fifth of the cases that had device removal timing specified reported a removal after 7 years following implantation (n = 2444/11 293).

Claims databases, compared to linked laboratory results, among six food and drug administration sentinel system data partners (two large national insurers, four integrated delivery systems) from february 20-october 17, 2020. We identified patients hospitalized with covid-19 according to five icd-10-cm diagnosis code-based algorithms, which included combinations of codes u07.1, b97.29, general coronavirus codes, and diagnosis codes for severe symptoms. We calculated the positive predictive value (ppv) and sensitivity of each algorithm relative to laboratory test results. We stratified results by data source type and across three time periods: february 20-march 31 (time a), april 1-30 (time b), may 1-october 17 (time c). The five algorithms identified between 34 806 and 47 293 patients across the study periods; 23% with known laboratory results contributed to ppv calculations.

We assessed the accuracy of claims-based algorithms to identify adults with ckd stages 3-5 compared with laboratory values in a subset (~40%) of a us commercial insurance claims database (optum's de-identified clinformatics® data mart database). We calculated the positive predictive value (ppv) of one or two icd-9 (2012-2014) or icd-10 (2016-2018) codes for ckd compared with a lab-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) occurring within prespecified windows (±90 days, ±180 days, ±365 days) of the icd-based ckd code(s). The study population ranged between 104 774 and 161 305 patients (icd-9 cohorts) and between 285 520 and 373 220 patients (icd-10 cohorts). The mean age was 74.4 years (icd-9) and 75.6 years (icd-10) and the median egfr was 48 ml/min/1.73 m  . The algorithm of two ckd codes compared with a lab value ±90 days of the first code achieved the highest ppv (ppv 86.36% [icd-9] and 86.07% [icd-10]). Overall, icd-10 based codes had comparable ppvs to icd-9 based codes and all icd-10 based algorithms had ppvs >80%. The algorithm of one ckd code compared with laboratory value ±180 days maintained the ppv above 80% but still retained a large number of patients (ppv 80.32% [icd-9] and 81.56% [icd-10]).

Using data from 2015 to 2016 and 2017 to 2018 national health and nutrition examination survey, we compared responses to a single question on medication use for depression with responses to a detailed questionnaire confirmed by inspecting medication packages or pharmacy printouts. There was a strong agreement (96.4%) between response to a single question about using medication for depression and responses to questions about using antidepressants or other psychiatric medications for depression on the detailed questionnaire. The single-question assessment had excellent sensitivity (93.8%) and specificity (96.7%), positive predictive value (71.5%), and kappa (0.79). Psychometric properties were mostly consistent across population subgroups. Single-question assessments of medication use for depression have acceptable concurrent validity against more detailed assessments and provide an efficient method for assessing medication treatment of depression in population health surveys.",34907612

Recent guidelines recommend the prescription of long-acting antipsychotic formulations (lais) as early as the first episode in patients with schizophrenia. The optimus study evaluated real-world use of a new three-monthly paliperidone palmitate formulation (pp3m) in france. For this observational cross-sectional study, all french psychiatrists were invited to enrol patients who had initiated pp3m in the previous 4 months. Snapshot data were collected at a routine consultation, without any modification of clinical practice. This population of 350 patients with schizophrenia started on pp3m predominantly included single men, living independently with a diagnosis of schizophrenia for a median of 9.3 years. Demographic characteristics were broadly comparable to those reported in other studies on lais. Investigators cited treatment simplification (96.9%) and patient comfort (93.3%) as the most common reasons for switching to pp3m; enhancing adherence was mentioned less often (61.1%) with most patients previously considered as adherent, and a majority of them expressing a positive attitude to their treatment. One-third of patients accepted the psychiatrist's proposal to initiate pp3m treatment without any discussion, and relatives were involved in the therapeutic decision-making process in only 23.7% of cases. After initiation, few changes were seen in professional follow-up frequency or concomitant pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities except for a decrease in antipsychotic polytherapy. Pp3m is mostly prescribed in adherent patients with fairly stable schizophrenia, and the longer dosing interval does not substantially affect patient care.",34897888

We used negative control outcomes to assess potential confounding in an observational study of pcsk9i versus ezetimibe or high-intensity statin. Using commercial claims, we identified u.s. Adults initiating pcsk9i, ezetimibe, or high-intensity statin in 2015-2018, with other lipid-lowering therapy (llt) use in the year prior (llt cohort) or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd) in the past 90 days (ascvd cohort). We compared initiators of pcsk9i to ezetimibe and high-intensity statin by estimating one-year risks of negative control outcomes influenced by frailty or health-seeking behaviors. Inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted estimators of risk differences (rds) were used to evaluate residual confounding after controlling for covariates. Pcsk9i initiators had lower one-year risks of negative control outcomes associated with frailty, such as decubitus ulcer in the ascvd cohort (pcsk9i vs. High-intensity statin rd = -3.5%, 95% confidence interval (ci): -4.6%, -2.5%; pcsk9i vs. Ezetimibe rd = -1.3%, 95% ci: -2.1%, -0.6%), with similar but attenuated associations in the llt cohort. Lower risks of accidents and fractures were also observed for pcsk9i, varying by cohort. Risks were similar for outcomes associated with health-seeking behaviors, although trended higher for pcsk9i in the ascvd cohort. Observed associations suggest lower frailty and potentially greater health-seeking behaviors among pcsk9i initiators, particularly those with a recent ascvd diagnosis, with the potential to bias real-world analyses of treatment effectiveness.",34894377

We examined trends in monthly ppi dispensings, switches from higher to lower strength formulations, and volume (kg) dispensed and sold. From may 2019, we observed a small, immediate decrease (-7830 [95%ci: -8818 to -6842]) in standard strength ppi dispensings/month, which rebounded to exceed pre-intervention levels by december 2020. High strength dispensings decreased until the end of the study period to less than half their pre-intervention average/month; low strength dispensings/month increased until the end of the study period to more than double their pre-intervention average/month. We observed transient increases in switches to lower strength formulations post-intervention. The kilograms of ppis sold/month followed a similar pattern to pbs kilograms dispensed/month with the exception of standard strength formulations where pbs dispensings decreased by -74 (95%ci: -93 to -55) but total sales remained unchanged (comprising pbs and private prescriptions, and over-the-counter sales). Tightened prescribing restrictions had an immediate and sustained impact on ppi use in australia, with decreased high strength use and increased low strength use.

Vaccination is recommended for pregnant women to decrease risk of infection and hospitalizations between both the women themselves and infants. However, vaccination rates remain low in pregnant women. The objective of this study was to determine the association between having a usual source of care and seasonal influenza vaccination rates among women who were pregnant between 2012 and 2016. A retrospective study was conducted using pooled data from the 2012-2016 medical expenditure panel survey. Frequencies of seasonal influenza vaccinations and other sociodemographic factors were estimated. A multivariable log-binomial regression model was used to examine the association between having a usual source of care and seasonal influenza vaccination rates. The weighted influenza vaccination rate among pregnant women was 54.5%. About one third did not have a usual source of care. The adjusted prevalence ratio of receiving an influenza vaccine for pregnant women without a usual source of care was 0.76 (95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.98). The top three main reasons for not having a usual source of care were being seldom or never sick (55.7%), not having health insurance (10.6%), and having recently moved to an area (9.9%). Pregnant women without a usual source of care had significantly lower probability of being vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Improving access to care through greater insurance coverage, addressing cost barriers, and providing patient education may help improve vaccination rates in this population.",34888983

However, there are few reports on the incidence of bleeding events during treatment with anti-influenza drugs. This large-scale quantitative assessment compared the incidence of bleeding events in influenza patients treated with baloxavir and other anti-influenza drugs and in untreated patients. This retrospective cohort study used a large-scale japanese employment-based health insurance claims database provided by jmdc inc. And included outpatients diagnosed with influenza between october 1, 2018 and april 11, 2019. Bleeding events were identified by international classification of diseases 10th revision codes. Incidences were compared between patients treated with baloxavir or neuraminidase inhibitors and untreated patients. Odds ratios were calculated after exact matching to adjust for potential confounders.

Both lasso and random forest are appealing modeling methods, yet it is not clear which method performs better for clinical risk prediction. To compare models developed using lasso versus random forest for predicting neurological dysfunction among fluoroquinolone users. We developed and validated risk prediction models using claims data from a commercially insured population. The study cohort included adults dispensed an oral fluoroquinolone, and outcomes were cns and pns dysfunction. Model predictors included demographic variables, comorbidities and medications known to be associated with neurological symptoms, and several healthcare utilization predictors. We assessed the accuracy and calibration of these models using measures including auc, calibration curves, and brier scores. The underlying cohort contained 16 533 (1.18%) individuals with cns dysfunction and 46 995 (3.34%) individuals with pns dysfunction during 120 days of follow-up. For cns dysfunction, lasso had an auc of 0.81 (95% ci: 0.80, 0.82), while random forest had an auc of 0.80 (95% ci: 0.80, 0.81). For pns dysfunction, lasso had an auc of 0.75 (95% ci: 0.74, 0.76) versus an auc of 0.73 (95% ci: 0.73, 0.74) for random forest. Both lasso models had better calibration, with brier scores 0.17 (lasso) versus 0.20 (random forest) for cns dysfunction and 0.20 (lasso) versus 0.25 (random forest) for pns dysfunction. Lasso outperformed random forest in predicting cns and pns dysfunction among fluoroquinolone users, and should be considered for modeling when the cohort is modest in size, when the number of model predictors is modest, and when predictors are primarily binary.",34881470

Cohorts were restricted to patients with a recent coronary event-related hospital contact identified in the patient register. The study included 45 987 unique, naïve users of ticagrelor (73% men; mean age 66 years) or clopidogrel (69% men; mean age 69 years). Corresponding to indication, diagnoses before initiation were acute coronary syndrome (93%), myocardial infarction (76%), and percutaneous coronary intervention (69%). The most common medications used in the year before initiation of study therapy were antithrombotic agents (clopidogrel 62%, ticagrelor 43%), mainly low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. Ticagrelor users had a higher incidence (per 1000 person-years) of respiratory bleeding (24.6 [95% confidence interval (ci): 22.1-27.3]; vs clopidogrel users: 14.4 [13.1-15.8]) and dyspnea (25.9 [23.3-28.7]; vs clopidogrel users: 16.8 [15.4-18.4]). Epistaxis accounted for 83-93% of respiratory bleeds. Adjusted analyses found increased risks of gout and acute renal failure with ticagrelor. Clopidogrel users were older with a higher prevalence of concomitant medications than ticagrelor users.

We retrospectively identified inpatients who underwent surgery for gastric, colon, or liver cancer between april 2016 and march 2018 at four hospitals. Chart reviews were conducted to identify postsurgical infections. We used bootstrap analysis with backwards variable elimination to select independent variables from routinely collected diagnosis and procedure data. Selected variables were used to create a score predicting the chart review-identified infections, and the performance of the score was tested. Among the 746 eligible patients, 96 patients (13%) had postoperative infections. Three variables were identified as predictors: diagnosis of infectious disease recorded as a complication arising after admission, addition of an intravenous antibiotic, and bacterial microscopy or culture.

Heightened awareness of risks may have changed prescribing habits over the years. However, these trends are not fully described, especially in vulnerable people such as multimorbid older adults. We aimed to describe the annual prevalence of benzodiazepine and other hypnotic use in relation to multimorbidity among older adults in the province of quebec, canada, from 2000 to 2016. We conducted a population-based study using the quebec integrated chronic disease surveillance system. We included all individuals aged ≥66 years covered by the public drug plan. For each year, we evaluated the sex- and age-standardized proportion of benzodiazepine and other hypnotic users, defined as individuals with at least one drug claim in the year. We stratified our results according to multimorbidity and used log-binomial regression to study trends. The proportion of individuals using benzodiazepines decreased from 34.8% in 2000 to 24.8% in 2016 (p for trend <0.001). Multimorbid people (≥2 chronic diseases) remained the highest users over the years, with 43.3% and 30.6% of them being users in 2000 and 2016, respectively.

Drug utilization was measured by defined daily dose (ddd)/1000 inhabitants/day (did) unit. Drug sales data were further used to test the correlation of ppis and h2ras to analgesics. During the study period, analgesic utilization increased from 65.7 to 67.4 did. Nsaids constituted 82.7%-84.9% of all analgesic utilization. The consumption of nsaids increased by 3.1%, and the most commonly consumed analgesic was diclofenac (18.5 ± 1.5 did), constituting 25.4%-29.0% of all analgesics. Ppi utilization was found to regularly raise from 52.1 did in 2014 to 72.0 did in 2018 with an overall increment of 38.2%. Use of h2ras was found to increase from 11.4 did in 2014 to 14.0 did in 2018.

Patients had to initiate antiretroviral therapy after 1 january 2004 with a nucleos(t)ide backbone of either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine and a contemporary third (anchor) drug. Patients were followed until a first esld event, death, end of a cohort's esld validation period, loss to follow-up or 31 december 2015. We estimated associations between cumulative exposure to each drug and esld using a hierarchical bayesian survival model with weakly informative prior distributions. Among 10 564 patients included from 12 cohorts, 62 had an esld event. Of the nine anchor drugs, boosted protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir had the strongest signals for esld, with increasing hazard ratios (hr) and narrowing credible intervals (cri), from a prior hr of 1.5 (95% cri 0.32-7.1) per 5 year's exposure to posterior hrs respectively of 1.8 (95% cri 0.82-3.9) and 2.0 (95% cri 0.86-4.7). Both backbones and efavirenz showed no signal. Hepatitis c coinfection was the most important covariate risk factor (hr 4.4, 95% cri 2.6-7.0). While contemporary antiretrovirals pose less risk for esld than hepatitis coinfection, atazanavir and darunavir had a toxicity signal. We show how hierarchical bayesian modelling can be used to detect toxicity signals in cohort event monitoring data even with complex treatments and few events.",34729853

In pharmacy claims, the days supplied value may not reflect the true duration of warfarin dispensation. This may affect the measures of association comparing the safety of direct oral anticoagulants (doacs) versus warfarin. Using quebec healthcare administrative databases, we formed a cohort of 55 230 patients newly treated with oral anticoagulants between 2010 and 2016. The duration of dispensations was defined using two approaches: the recorded days supplied value, and the longitudinal coverage approximation (data-driven) that may account for individual variation in drug usage patterns. Propensity scores adjusted cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (hr) of major bleeding with dabigatran or rivaroxaban versus warfarin. Using the days supplied, the mean (and standard deviation) dispensation durations for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin were 19 (15), 19 (14), and 13 (12) days, respectively. Using the data-driven approach, the durations were 20 (16), 19 (15), and 15 (16) days, respectively. The choice of the approach had no impact on the hr estimates. In our settings, the data-driven approach closely approximated the recorded days supplied value for the standard dose therapies such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban. For warfarin, the data-driven approach captured more variability in the duration of dispensations compared to the days supplied value, which may better reflect the true drug-taking behavior of warfarin. Both approaches may provide valid estimates when comparing the safety of doacs versus warfarin.",34714965

Quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis to examine data from a nationwide electronic healthcare record database (bifap). Quarterly cumulative incidence of agomelatine use per 100 000 patients was calculated and the impact of four regulatory interventions was quantified. The incidence of agomelatine use decreased by 85% and 87% from first quarter 2011 to last quarter 2018 in patients below and above 75 years old, respectively. Regulatory actions taken were not associated with an immediate and significant falling level of use or slope. The incidence was less than expected 6 months after the first and third intervention for patients below and above 75 years old, and more than expected after the second and fourth intervention for both populations, though these analyses were underpowered to observe significant results. The downward trend became less pronounced, reaching a residual level of use, which remained stable in the last segment of the study period. New users of agomelatine decreased throughout the study period, starting before interventions took place. The effect of specific interventions might be masked by the progressive decrease tendency, constant over the study period. The effects of external factors that might overlap, unintended consequences, and issues concerning statistical modeling in situations where rates are already falling, should be considered when interpreting the results.",34676940

We present a transparent, step-by-step approach to the development of drug exposure measures involving secondary data. This approach would be of interest to students and investigators with initial training in pharmacoepidemiology. We illustrate the approach using a study about parkinson's disease. We described the exposure specifications according to the study question. Next, we refined the exposure measure by linking it to knowledge about four major concepts in drug safety and effectiveness studies: drug use patterns, duration, timing, and dose. We then used this knowledge to guide the ultimate choice of exposure measure: time-varying, cumulative 6-month exposure to tamsulosin (a drug used to treat prostate hyperplasia). The proposed approach links exposure specifications to four major concepts in drug safety and effectiveness studies.

We compared the number of diseases included in the measures, the process of data extraction (case definition) and the validation process. We assessed the methodological robustness using eight criteria, five based on general criteria for indicators (aire instrument) and three multimorbidity-specific criteria. Twenty-two multimorbidity measures were identified. The number of diseases they included ranged from 5 to 84 (median = 20), with 19 measures including both physical and mental conditions. Diseases were identified using icd codes extracted from inpatient and outpatient data (18/22) and sometimes including drug claims (10/22). The validation process relied mainly on the capacity of the measures to predict health outcome (5/22), or on the validation of each individual disease against a gold standard (8/22). Six multimorbidity measures met at least six of the eight robustness criteria assessed. There is significant heterogeneity among the measures used to assess multimorbidity in administrative databases, and about a third are of low to moderate quality. A more consensual approach to the number of diseases or groups of diseases included in multimorbidity measures may improve comparison between regions, and potentially provide better control for multimorbidity-related confounding in studies.",34623723

This method uses the amount of drug redeemed, when available, and researcher-defined temporal gaps to fill the interval between the calculated end of coverage of a redeemed prescription and the date of redemption of the next prescription in the same treatment episode. The final scope is defining periods of continuous use of medications. There are strong pharmacological and epidemiological arguments for adding the gap at the end of each treatment episode. However, the evidence is scarce on the impact that such a practice has on measures of association. This study aims to compare the impact of adding or not adding the researcher-defined gap time to the end of a treatment episode on the incidence of drug discontinuation and the incidence rate for a simulated outcome that occurred during an observational window. Additionally, the study aims at assessing the magnitude of misclassification of exposure time between the two methods. A simulated dataset of 100 patients available in the r package adherer that contains 1080 redeemed prescriptions was used. A gap time of 90 days was used for constructing treatment episodes in an observational window of 365 days following the first redeemed prescription. Two approaches were used for defining treatment episodes that were named ""gap+"" and ""gap-"" and that respectively add and did not add the gap time at the end of a treatment episode. An outcome was simulated by using an exponential baseline hazard function with scale parameter λ = 0.5 and censoring at time t = 365 days. The incidence rate ratio for the simulated outcome between the two approaches was computed. The 100 patients were followed for a median time of 183 days (interquartile range, iqr 50-365 days) and a median time of 273 days (iqr 140-365 days), respectively using ""gap-"" and ""gap+"". During the first 100 days of the follow-up period, none of the patients was found to discontinue the treatment with the method ""gap+"" while 38 patients discontinued using the method ""gap-"". The approach ""gap+"" exerted a higher incidence rate for the simulated outcome among the exposed (0.98 events/person-years) when compared to the ""gap-"" (0.82 events/person-years) during defined periods of continuous treatment use. When comparing the two approaches and using the method ""gap-"" as the reference group, the incidence rate ratio for the simulated outcome was 1.20 (95% confidence interval: ci 0.72-2.02) among the exposed. This study showed that not adding the gap at the end of the treatment episodes leads to an overestimation of drug discontinuation, particularly at the beginning of the observational window, and an underestimation of the incidence rate of a hypothetical outcome during the period of exposure to the medication.",34611960

This study suggests that to reduce the potential immortal time bias, selection bias, and exposure misclassification inherent to the fe method, the ue method could be used for identifying switching and add-on therapies. If not used as a main exposure definition, the ue method may be used to investigate the impact of ue time in a sensitivity analysis.",34558772

Using the iqvia pharmetrics® plus database, we identified 5655 commercially insured youth (3-18 years) with depression who newly initiated an antidepressant anytime from january 2007 to june 2015. No antidepressant use within 1 year prior to the index prescription defined new use. Latent class growth analysis of antidepressant dosing in the 6 months after initiation defined the exposure groups. The outcome was any regimen change, that is, antidepressant augmentation with another psychotropic or discontinuation of the antidepressant, with and without switching to another psychotropic. Baseline covariates measured in the 6 months before antidepressant initiation included demographic factors, psychiatric comorbidities, and health service use. Multinomial logistic regression tested the association between antidepressant dose trajectories and the odds of an antidepressant regimen change. Five dose trajectories were sharp decline (n = 897; 16%), slow decline (n = 1029; 18%), stable minimum dose (n = 1397; 25%), stable maximum dose (n = 1783; 32%), and increasing high dose (n = 549; 10%). Relative to the stable minimum dose group, the sharp and slow decline groups were more likely to discontinue the antidepressant, either switch to another psychotropic (or [odds ratio]: 5.91; 95%ci: 3.23-10.80 and or: 1.67; 95%ci: 1.04-2.68, respectively) or stop all psychotropic medication (or: 6.64; 95%ci: 4.24-10.39 and or: 1.62; 95%ci: 1.22-2.13, respectively). However, the stable maximum and increasing high-dose groups were less likely to discontinue, either switch (or: 0.38; 95%ci: 0.24-0.61 and or: 0.30; 95%ci: 0.16-0.59, respectively) or stop all psychotropic medications (or: 0.15; 95%ci: 0.12-0.20 and or: 0.02; 95%ci: 0.01-0.03 respectively) than augment with another psychotropic. The findings from this cross-sectional study demonstrate an association between antidepressant dose trajectories within 6 months of initiating treatment and the odds of augmenting with another psychotropic.",34529312

Although measures to support smoking cessation have been implemented worldwide, smokers often fail to quit smoking after receiving pharmacotherapies for nicotine dependence. The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of varenicline for smoking cessation compared with no pharmacotherapy using actual paid medical cost data in japan. This was a retrospective cohort study of 3657 subjects who had quit smoking with varenicline or no pharmacotherapy. We extracted health examination and medical claim data from a health insurer database for the period 2012-2015. We calculated the incremental cost-effective ratio (icer) of varenicline using actual paid medical costs for nicotine dependence and the number needed to treat to maintain smoking cessation compared with no pharmacotherapy, considering sex, age, income, and occupation. The 1- and 2-year smoking cessation maintenance rates were 69.7% and 62.4%, respectively. We found that 8.8% of subjects who quit smoking used varenicline for nicotine dependence and the cost per person was japanese yen (jpy) 52 177 (u.s. Dollars [usd] 474; usd 1 = jpy 110). The icer of varenicline was dominant when comparing 2-year cessation with 1-year cessation. Male, age <40 years, low income, and manufacturing workers were the most cost-effective variables. The cost-effective variables of varenicline in the real world were investigated. The results of this study strengthen the evidence regarding which type of people should be targeted for measures to support smoking cessation using varenicline.",34529297

Also, to analyse the off-label prescription of medicines under current practice in this age group according to different evidence sources. A five-year (2015-2019) exploratory observational study about off-label prescription in neonates and infants (0 to 1 year) at primary health care in spain. All drug prescriptions in this age group were analysed and classified according to their labelling in off-label or on-label. The drugs prescribed off-label were subsequently reviewed in national formularies and other databases to assess its evidence of use beyond what is recommended in the summary of product characteristics (smpc). On average 34.50% of total prescriptions were prescribed off-label according to the smpc. 17.93% of total prescriptions in neonates and infants up to 1 year old were not based on clinical evidence from smpc, pediamécum, bnf or dailymed. In more than 88% of cases, off-label use was related to the posology section of the smpc, followed by the therapeutic indications and contraindications sections, in 35.20% and 24.10% of cases, respectively. Almost 13% of off-label drugs were over-the-counter. Salbutamol followed by topical tobramycin and colecalciferol were the drugs most prescribed off-label. Off-label use of drugs remains as an important public health concern, especially for neonates and infants up to 1 year, who receive the greatest proportion of off-label prescriptions. The evidence-based off-label prescription is a widespread practice that has shown a stable trend during the 5-year study period providing also a certain extent of flexibility to paediatricians in some therapeutic decisions.",34505314

Registered bleedings were identified in a cohort of new users of doacs in bifap using icpc 2 and icd 9 codes; we ascertained these bleedings as mb through a validation strategy based on the mb definition from the international society on thrombosis and hemostasis, which used hospitalization and critical localization as proxies. We assessed hospitalization with hospital discharge information (only available for some years and regions) and a free text-based algorithm created to identify hospitalization in ehr's clinical notes. Incidence rates (ir) of mb were evaluated by bleeding type. The study cohort included 104 614 patients, with 274521.5 p-y of follow up. There were 6143 registered bleedings during the study period (519 intracranial bleeding - icb, 4606 gastrointestinal bleeding - gib, 1018 extracranial bleeding - ecb), from which 1679 were confirmed as mb (416 icb, 1086 gib, and 177 ecb). The free text-based semi-automatic algorithm had moderate recall (0.59), but high specificity (0.99), and precision (0.94). The combination of hospitalization and critical localization is a valid approach to validate mb in ehrs with incomplete information. The use of more automatic methods for case validation instead of manual review of clinical notes is favored.",34499394

Key methodological elements must be reported for maximum transparency. We identified key methodological elements necessary for fully understanding perinatal pharmacoepidemiology research and quantified the proportion of studies that reported these elements in a sample of publications. Key methodological elements were identified from guidelines from regulatory agencies, literature, and subject-matter knowledge: source of information to determine pregnancy start; mother- or father-infant linkages (process, success rate); unit of analysis; and whether non-live births and fetuses with various anomalies were included in the study population. We conducted a literature review for recent observational studies on medical product utilization or safety during pregnancy and estimated the prevalence of reporting these elements. Data were extracted from a random sample of 100 publications; 8% were published in epidemiology/pharmacoepidemiology journals; 85% were medical product-safety studies. Of publications for which each element was applicable, 43% reported the source for determining pregnancy start; 57%, whether the study population included multifetal pregnancies; 39%, whether it included more than one pregnancy per woman; 27%, whether it included fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities; 60%, fetuses with major congenital malformations; and 93%, non-live births. Of the 20 studies with mother-infant linkage, 35% described the process; 21% reported the linkage success rate. Among studies with more than one pregnancy/offspring per woman, 22% reported methods addressing sibling correlation. In this sample of pregnancy-related pharmacoepidemiology publications, completeness of reporting could have been improved.

The success trial showed improved remission with infliximab plus thiopurines combined compared to infliximab monotherapy in patients with uc. Based on two us commercial claims databases (ibm marketscan and optum) and the french nationwide health insurance database (snds) from 2004 through 2019, all patients with uc who initiated combination therapy or infliximab alone were identified. The primary outcome of treatment failure was emulated by: hospitalization related to uc or colectomy, treatment switch to another biologic or immunosuppressant, or use of corticosteroids 16 weeks after infliximab initiation. We estimated risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals after 1:1 propensity score (ps) matching. Among 620 ps-matched pairs of combination therapy and infliximab monotherapy users, treatment failure occurred in 124 (20%) of patients initiating combination therapy and 170 (27%) during monotherapy. Like in success, the risk of treatment failure was decreased with combination therapy in the overall cohort (rr = 0.73; 95% ci: 0.60-0.90). Findings were consistent across marketscan, optum, and snds: rr = 0.76 (0.57-1.02), 0.82 (0.54-1.24), and 0.61 (0.41-0.90). Similar results were observed for each component endpoint.

The relationship between accumulating medication use and physical function has not been examined in a longitudinal cohort. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study using prospectively collected data from the study of women's health across the nation (swan). Community-dwelling women from five us cities were followed for up to 20 years. The exposure of interest was the number of prescription medications. They were examined as a count variable and then for specific categories of medication. The outcome of interest was physical function measured repeatedly using the short form (sf)-36 physical function (pf) scale. Linear mixed models, using repeated measures of sociodemographics and comorbidities were assessed. 1452 participants qualified for the analyses with a median follow-up of 19.2 years. At baseline, the mean age was 46.5 years and 53.5% reported white race. Fully adjusted models demonstrated a reduction in the sf-36 pf of 0.99 for each additional prescription medication used or a 6.14-point reduction for women reporting more than five medications and an 8.92-point reduction among those reporting more than 10 medications. These results were similar across race and ethnicity. Specific medication categories with a significant and largely negative impact (at least a two-point reduction) on physical component score included beta-blockers, analgesics, glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, anticoagulants, and anti-depressants. There is a moderate association between increasing medication use and decreasing physical function among women transitioning through the mid-life.",34496108

While clinical trials did not confirm a causal role, case reports suggested a possible link of varenicline with neuropsychiatric adverse drug events (npaes). This study aims to investigate the risk of npaes associated with varenicline initiation among the general population in a real-world setting. We conducted a sequence symmetry analysis (ssa) based on the university of groningen iadb.nl prescription database. We selected incident users of both varenicline and marker drugs for npaes, including depression, anxiety and sleep disorder within different time-intervals. Adjusted sequence ratios (asr) were calculated for each time-interval. Within 365-days' time-interval 1066 patients were incident users of both varenicline and npae marker drugs. In total, 505 patients were prescribed varenicline before npae marker drugs and 561 vice versa (crude sequence ratio [csr] 0.90, 95% ci: 0.80-1.02). After adjustments for trends in prescriptions, overall a null association was found (asr 1.00, 95% ci: 0.89-1.13). Regarding specific npaes, no increased risks were found for depression nor anxiety within any time-interval. A small transient increased risk was found for sleep disorders, particularly in earlier time-intervals 3 and 6 months (asrs 1.52, 95% ci: 1.10-2.11 and 1.45, 95% ci: 1.15-1.83, respectively). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. Varenicline initiation was unlikely to be associated with an increased risk of taking anti-depressants nor anti-anxiety drugs. Yet a small, but statistically significant, transient association with drugs for sleep disorders was noticed, possibly associated with withdrawal symptoms caused by smoking cessation.",34464494

Primary to examine the annual patterns of ppi use. Secondary- to assess indications for initiating ppi treatment, long-term use, and factors associated with long-term use in a large israeli health maintenance organization. A historical cohort study of 528 420 eligible ppi users during 2000-2015, analyzed ppi use using defined daily doses and the proportion of patients covered method. Data on indications for treatment initiation, clinical and socio-demographic parameters were captured as well. A multivariable logistic-regression model was used to identify factors associated with long-term use of ppi. The annual incidence rates of patients initiating ppi treatment were relatively constant, ranging between 2.4% and 3.1% of the adult population, with a monotonic increase in annual consumption and prevalence (reaching 12.7% in 2015). Reflux, functional symptoms, and helicobacter pylori eradication were the most common indications for initiating ppi therapy. However, 27% of patients had no recorded indication for treatment. Fifteen percent of patients used ppi for over 6 months, especially in older age groups. Utilization of ppi increases steadily, mainly due to chronic use. Prolonged consumption is associated with specific clinical indications and older age. Health organizations should encourage awareness of appropriate use among physicians, specifically in the elderly, patients with reflux, and those with functional disorders.",34453456

We sought to describe the impact of the dissemination of these findings on the use of hydrochlorothiazide and health care utilization among antihypertensive users in denmark. In this nationwide observational study, we performed descriptive analyses of a cohort comprising all danish antihypertensive treatment users january 2016 through september 2020 (n = 1 316 476) with special focus on hydrochlorothiazide users (n = 309 743). Data were retrieved from the danish nationwide health registries, including the danish national prescription registry. The use of hydrochlorothiazide dropped by 44% from january 2016 to september 2020, with the proportion of all antihypertensive fills constituted by hydrochlorothiazide dropping from 12.7% to 7.2%. This decline was more pronounced among younger patients and patients with a history of skin cancer. Simultaneously, the monthly rate of new hydrochlorothiazide users in denmark dropped from ≈2350 throughout 2017 to 652 during 2020. The publication of an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer led to an estimated excess of up to 11 510 physical and 22 870 e-mail/phone consultations to general practitioners. No evidence for increased risk of adverse outcomes was found. The publication of increased risk of skin cancer with hydrochlorothiazide use has led to a marked decline in the use of hydrochlorothiazide in denmark.

High-risk opioid use was defined as ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents per day and/or having concurrent dispensing of a benzodiazepine based on overlapping days of coverage. The prevalence of high-risk opioid use among adults in the us decreased from 12.0% in 2011 to 9.4% in 2016 (p < 0.01).

Declines in high-risk use prevalence were observed across 49 states, with only south dakota experiencing an increase (+13.7% relative increase). Similar to earlier years, in 2016 50.9% of all high-risk use opioid users received all their opioid prescriptions from a single prescriber, and 71.1% used a single pharmacy to fill them. Despite clinically significant declines in high-risk opioid use, in 2016 nearly 1 in 10 adult retail pharmacy users remained at high-risk for opioid overdose in the us.

We examined positive predictive values (ppv) and other test characteristics of icd-10-gm code algorithms for detecting ana as used in a multinational safety study (pass). We performed a cross-sectional study on routine data from a german academic hospital (2004-2019, age ≥ 18). Chart review was used for case verification. Potential cases were identified from the hospital administration system. The main outcome required at least one of the following: any type of specific in-hospital code (t78.2, t88.6, and t80.5) or specific outpatient code in combination with a symptom code or in-hospital non-specific code (t78.4, t88.7, and y57.9) in combination with two symptom codes. Ppv were calculated with 95% confidence interval. Sensitivity analyses modified type of codes, unit of analysis, verification criteria and time period. The most specific algorithm used only primary codes for ana (numbers added in brackets). Four hundred and sixteen eligible cases were evaluated, and 78 (37) potential ana cases were identified. Ppv were 62.8% (95% ci 51.1-73.5) (main) and 77.4% (58.9-90.4) (most specific). Ppv from all modifications ranged from 12.9% to 80.6%. The sensitivity of the main algorithm was 66.2%, specificity 91.5%, and negative predictive value 92.6%. Corresponding figures for the most specific algorithm were 32.4%, 98.0%, and 87.0%. The ppv of the main algorithm seems of acceptable validity for use in comparative safety research but will underestimate absolute risks by about a third. Restriction to primary discharge codes markedly improves ppv to the expense of reducing sensitivity.",34418227

The aim of this study was to determine the degree of correspondence between the ukrr-mpi and aki international classification disease-10 (icd-10) n17 coding in hospital episode statistics (hes) and whether hospital n17 coding correlated with 30-day mortality and emergency re-admission after aki. Aki e-alerts in people aged ≥18 years, collated in the ukrr-mpi during 2017, were linked to hes data to identify a hospitalised aki population. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyse associations between absence/presence of n17 codes and clinicodemographic features. Correlation of the percentage coded with n17 and 30-day mortality and emergency re-admission after aki were calculated at hospital level. In 2017, there were 301 540 adult episodes of hospitalised aki in england. Aki severity was positively associated with coding in hes, with a high degree of inter-hospital variability-aki stage 1 mean of 48.2% [sd 14.0], versus aki stage 3 mean of 83.3% [sd 7.3]. N17 coding in hes depended on demographic features, especially age (18-29 years vs. ≥85 years or 0.22, 95% ci 0.21-0.23), as well as sex and ethnicity. There was no evidence of association between the proportion of episodes coded for aki with short-term aki outcomes. Coding of aki in hes is influenced by many factors that result in an underestimation of aki. Using e-alerts to triangulate the true incidence of aki could provide a better understanding of the factors that affect hospital coding, potentially leading to improved coding, patient care and pharmacoepidemiologic research.",34418198

Previous research has considered hypothetical sensitivity and specificity values, whereas this study aims to assess the impact of literature-based real values of exposure misclassification. A synthetic cohort study was constructed based on the proportion of exposure theoretically captured in a database (range 0.5-1.0) and the level of adherence (0.5-1.0). Three scenarios were explored: nondifferential misclassification, differential misclassification (misclassifications dependent on an unmeasured risk factor doubling the outcome risk), and nondifferential misclassification in a comparative effectiveness study (rr  and rr  both 2.0 compared to nonuse, rr  1.0). For the scenarios with nondifferential misclassification, 25% nonadherence or 25% uncaptured exposure changed the rr from 2.0 to 1.75, and 1.95, respectively. Applying different proportions of nonadherence or uncaptured use (20% vs. 40%) for subgroups with and without the risk factor, an rr of 0.95 was observed in the absence of a true effect (i.e., true rr = 1). In the comparative effectiveness study, no effect on rr was seen for different proportions of uncaptured exposure; however, different levels of nonadherence for the drugs (20% vs. 40%) led to an underestimation of rr  (0.89). All scenarios led to biased estimates, but the magnitude of the bias differed across scenarios. When testing the robustness of findings of pharmacoepidemiologic studies, we recommend using realistic values of nonadherence and uncaptured exposure based on real-world data.",34396634

We analyzed trend changes of national zolpidem users from the iqvia total patient tracker (tpt) and zolpidem exposure cases reported to the national poison data system (npds), 2009-2018. To control for time varying confounding, the adjusted trends were analyzed using simple and controlled interrupted time series (its). We also adjusted for seasonal changes. Three sedating antidepressants were used together as a control. The national estimates of high-dose zolpidem users in tpt decreased significantly in the month immediately post-dsc; the absolute level decrease was -12.51 (95% ci: -14.12, -10.89) per 10 000 u.s. Population relative to sedating antidepressants. The trend continuously decreased post-dsc, resulting in a 59% overall decrease by the end of the study period. There was a larger decrease in high-dose zolpidem use in females than in males. There was a level decrease of zolpidem exposure cases in the npds immediately post-dsc, -0.37 absolute decline (95% ci, -0.53, -0.20) per 10 000 national zolpidem users; or -1.33 absolute decline (95% ci, -1.54, -1.13) per 1000 total npds exposure cases relative to sedating antidepressants. Similar patterns were observed for cases reporting drowsiness. The results from the single its and controlled its were similar. Zolpidem users and exposure cases decreased significantly post-dsc, suggesting practitioners and patients became aware of and responded to the zolpidem dscs.",34382718

For each patient we uniformly sampled multiple random index dates within a sampling window of length   . For each index date, we identified the last preceding prescription redemption, if any, within distance   . Based on all pairs of last prescription and index date, we estimated prescription durations using the rwtd with robust variance estimation. In simulation studies with increasing misspecification we investigated bias, root mean square error (rmse) and coverage probability of the rwtd using multiple index dates (1, 5, 10, and 20). We applied the method to danish data on warfarin prescriptions from 2013 to 2014 stratifying by and adjusting for sex and age. In simulation scenarios without misspecification, the relative bias was negligible (-0.04% to 0.01%) and nominal coverage probabilities almost retained (93.8%-95.4%). Rmse decreased with the number of random index dates (e.g., from 1.3 with 1 index date to 0.6 days with 5). With misspecification, the relative bias was higher irrespective of the number of index dates. Precision increased with the number of index dates, and hence coverage probabilities decreased. When estimating durations of warfarin prescriptions in denmark, precision increased with number of index dates, in particular in strata with few patients (e.g., men 90+ years: width of 95% confidence interval was 16.2 days with 5 index dates versus 35.4 with 1). Increasing the number of random index dates used with the rwtd improved precision without affecting bias.",34382713

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the japan medical data center claims database from 2005 to 2018. Patients with aps receiving warfarin treatment were included in this study. Adherence and persistence were evaluated using the proportion of days covered (pds) and refill gap methods, respectively. Demographic characteristics of patients were obtained. Kaplan-meier curves with log-rank tests and cox regression models were used to examine the association between adherence or persistence and time to thrombotic events. A total of 186 patients (mean age: 46.5 ± 12.4 years, females 68.8%) were included in this study. No significant differences were observed in risk factors for thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases among groups. Most patients were adherent (91.4%) and persistent (88.2%) to warfarin treatment. Adherent and persistent patients had a significantly higher rate of thrombotic event-free survival than nonadherent and nonpersistent patients (p < 0.05). Multivariable cox regression showed that the risk of thrombotic events was higher in nonadherent patients (with a hazard ratio of 3.23 [95% confidence interval ci: 1.15-9.11]) and in nonpersistent patients (with a hazard ratio of 3.45 [95% ci: 1.35-8.82]).

We conducted a register-based drug utilization study, describing patterns of commonly used medications with sedative effects leading up to and after nursing home admission using data from 94 danish nursing homes between 2015 and 2017. We identified 5179 residents (median age 84 years, 63% female) and described monthly incidence and total use of benzodiazepines (bzds), z drugs, mirtazapine/mianserin, quetiapine, promethazine, and melatonin. The proportion of unique users of sedating medications was similar before and after admission (42% before vs. 40% after) despite an increase in total use after admission. The overall incidence of sedating medications peaked in the 6 months before and 6 months after admission (peaking at 4.6 per 100 person-months 1 month after admission). The most commonly initiated medications were mirtazapine/mianserin, followed by bzds and z drugs. Total use of sedating medications increased leading up to admission (peaking at 1001 defined daily doses per 100 residents per month 1 month after admission) and decreased gradually after admission. Sedative medication initiation increases sharply leading up to admission in danish nursing homes. Mirtazapine/mianserin is a commonly used agent in nursing homes, despite limited evidence on benefits and harms.

We know of no existing validated algorithm for identifying nip in claims databases, limiting our ability to understand the morbidity and mortality of this toxicity in real-world data. Electronic health records (ehr), cancer registry, and administrative data from a national cancer institute-designated comprehensive cancer center were queried for patients diagnosed with lung cancer between 10/01/2015-12/31/2020. Health insurance claims were searched for icd-10-cm codes that indicate an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis with possible nip. A 20-code (algorithm a) and 11-code (algorithm b) algorithm were tested with and without requiring prescription with corticosteroids. Cases with a diagnosis of possible nip in the 6 months before their first lung cancer diagnosis were excluded. The algorithms were validated by reviewing the ehr. The positive predictive value (ppv) for each algorithm was computed with 95% confidence intervals (ci). Seventy patients with lung cancer had a diagnosis code compatible with nip: 36 (51.4%) inpatients and 34 (48.6%) outpatients. The ppv of algorithm a was 77.1% (95% ci: 65.6-86.3). The ppv of algorithm b was 86.9% (95% ci: 75.8-94.2). Requiring a documented prescription for a systemic corticosteroid improved the ppv of both algorithm a and algorithm b: 92.5% (95% ci: 79.6-98.4) and 100.0% (95% ci: 90.0-100.0), respectively.

Violations of this assumption are indicated by nonoverlap in the data in the sense that patients with certain covariate combinations are not observed to receive a treatment of interest, which may arise from contraindications to treatment or small sample size. In this paper, we emphasize the importance and implications of this often-overlooked assumption. Further, we elaborate on the challenges nonoverlap poses to estimation and inference and discuss previously proposed methods. We distinguish between structural and practical violations and provide insight into which methods are appropriate for each. To demonstrate alternative approaches and relevant considerations (including how overlap is defined and the target population to which results may be generalized) when addressing positivity violations, we employ an electronic health record-derived data set to assess the effects of metformin on colon cancer recurrence among diabetic patients.",34375473

This study assessed whether cinacalcet use is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in a large hemodialysis cohort. A linked database of clinical records and medical claims for patients receiving hemodialysis in a large dialysis organization, 2007-2010, was used. A nested case-control study was performed among patients aged ≥18 years who had received hemodialysis for ≥90 days, had medicare parts a, b, and d coverage for ≥1 year, and had clinical evidence of shpt (parathyroid hormone >300 pg/ml). Cases were those who experienced death or hospitalization caused by gastrointestinal bleeding. Each case was matched to up to four controls. Exposure was measured by any cinacalcet use, current use, past use, cumulative exposure days, and cumulative dosage. Conditional logistic models were used to assess the association. Of 48 437 patients included, 2570 experienced gastrointestinal bleeding events (2498 non-fatal, 72 fatal), and 2465 (2397 non-fatal, 68 fatal) were matched to 9500 controls; 17.2% of cases and 15.8% of controls had cinacalcet exposure and 11.1% of both cases and controls had current use. The adjusted odds ratios (95% ci) of gastrointestinal bleeding for any use, current use, and past use of cinacalcet were 1.04 (0.91-1.19), 0.97 (0.83-1.13), and 1.22 (0.99-1.50), respectively, with no use as the reference.

The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of opioid analgesic dispensing in children with current asthma and to identify patient and prescriber factors associated with the dispensing of opioid versus non-opioid analgesics. Children <18 years of age, having current asthma and receiving an incident analgesic prescription were identified from a large medicaid managed care plan during years 2013 through 2018. Current asthma was defined as both receiving an asthma diagnosis and filling an anti-asthmatic medication during the 12-month period prior to the analgesic medication initiation. A scoring algorithm was applied to associate analgesic prescription with procedures and diagnoses according to perceived need for analgesia and time proximity. Of the 9529 children meeting the inclusion criteria, 2681 (28.1%) received an opioid prescription. Opioid analgesic dispensing was most common among children who had an outpatient surgery/procedure (29.4%), trauma (19.4%) dental procedure (18.4%), and respiratory infection (10.6%). Multivariable analysis indicated that non-hispanic black (aor: 0.39[0.3-0.5]) and hispanic (aor: 0.51[0.4-0.6]) children were less likely to receive an opioid analgesic compared to their non-hispanic white counterparts. Children with prior history of asthma-related emergency department visit (aor: 1.24[1.0-1.5]) and short acting beta agonist overuse (aor: 1.33[1.1-1.7]) were more likely to fill an opioid analgesic prescription than those without. Opioid analgesics are frequently dispensed to children with asthma.

However, no apparent studies have reported national-level data on buprenorphine diversion. Case report data were drawn from a quarterly survey of prescription drug diversion completed by a national sample of law enforcement and regulatory agencies who engage in drug diversion investigations. Quarterly rates of buprenorphine diversion per 100 000 population and 100 000 prescriptions dispensed were calculated for the period 2002 through 2019. Population-based diversion rates were also calculated by u.s. Region. In total, 9670 cases of diverted buprenorphine were reported across all 50 states and the district of columbia during the study period. Buprenorphine diversion rates, per 100 000 population, were characterized by an accelerating increase over time; increases in diversion rates from 1st quarter 2002 through 4th quarter 2006 were not statistically significant, yet from 1st quarter 2007 through 4th quarter 2019, the rate of diversion cases increased by 0.0067 cases per 100 000 per quarter (p < 0.001). Buprenorphine diversion rates per 100 000 prescriptions dispensed indicated a gradual increase over time; from 3rd quarter 2010 through 4th quarter 2019, diversion rates showed a statistically significant increase of 0.28 cases (p = 0.037) per quarter on average.

However, in south africa, access to bm remains limited, hence, there is a need to develop strategies that will enable timely access to bm by all patients who need them. To develop a framework for the use of bm in south africa. Using a delphi questionnaire that was developed by integration of the opinions of newly qualified doctors (<2 years practice), prescribing specialists, and patients using bm, a delphi method was used to guide an experts' panel into consensus on the different opinions in the questionnaire, and from this, a framework for the use of bm was constructed. From the surveys, 76.2% of the newly qualified doctors and 91.7% of the prescribing specialists indicated that they had limited knowledge on the pharmacology of bm, and, respectively, 64.5% and 77.8% admitted that their knowledge on bm was not adequate for prescribing and taking care of patients on bm. Also, 58.3% and 75% of the prescribers indicated that the high cost and the tedious procurement process, respectively, were barriers of access to bm. The delphi panel reached consensus after two rounds, and the resultant framework recommends that, appropriate use of bm requires establishing guidelines for the use of bm, increasing bm content in the medical training programs and information resources used by healthcare professionals, enacting drug regulations and drug policies that will increase availability of bm, offering appropriate patient information and public engagement. The lack of knowledge on bm by health professionals, together with the high cost and a complex procurement processes are the major impediment to access to bm.

An nlp algorithm identified mentions of adenomyosis in clinical notes that were highly likely to represent a diagnosis. The anchor date was date of first affirmed adenomyosis mention; baseline characteristics were assessed in the 12 months prior to this date. Characteristics common to adenomyosis cases were used to select a suitable pool of women from the underlying population, among whom undiagnosed adenomyosis might exist. A random sample of this pool was selected to form the comparator cohort. Logistic regression was used to compare adenomyosis cases to comparators; the predictive probability (pp) of being an adenomyosis case was assessed. Comparators having a pp ≥ 0.1 were considered potentially undiagnosed adenomyosis and were used to calculate the prevalence of potentially undiagnosed adenomyosis in the underlying population. Among 11 456 347 women aged 18-55 years in the underlying population, 19 503 were adenomyosis cases. Among 332 583 comparators, 22 696 women were potentially undiagnosed adenomyosis cases.

For researchers, nepis have the potential to advance our understanding of the risks and benefits of medications in populations; however, due to their unstructured nature, they are not often utilized. The goal of this scoping review was to evaluate how nepis are currently employed in research, identify opportunities and challenges for their broader application, and provide recommendations on their future use. The scoping review comprised a comprehensive literature review and a survey of key stakeholders. From the literature review, we identified 33 primary articles that described the use of nepis. The majority of articles (n = 19) identified issues with the quality of information in nepis compared with structured prescribing information; nine articles described the development of novel algorithms that performed well in extracting information from nepis, and five described the used of manual or simpler algorithms to extract prescribing information from nepis. A survey of 19 stakeholders indicated concerns for the quality of information in nepis and called for standardization of nepis to reduce data variability/errors. Nevertheless, stakeholders believed nepis present an opportunity to identify prescriber's intent for the prescription and to study temporal treatment patterns. In summary, nepis hold much promise for advancing the field of pharmacoepidemiology. Researchers should take advantage of addressing important questions that can be uniquely answered with nepis, but exercise caution when using this information and carefully consider the quality of the data.",34278660

Two algorithms were assessed for icd-10-cm: validated icd-10 codes in the literature and codes translated from icd-9-cm using an established mapping algorithm. We used segmented regression analysis on time-series data to examine changes in the 3-month prevalence (both level and trend) before and after the icd-10-cm implementation. Significant changes in the level were found in 19 and 11 conditions when using the icd-10 codes from the literature and mapping algorithm, respectively. The conditions with inconsistent levels by both of the algorithms were valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, mild liver disease, moderate to severe liver disease, metastatic cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and collagen vascular diseases, coagulopathy, blood loss anemia, deficiency anemia, alcohol abuse, and psychosis. Nine conditions had significant changes in the trend when using the icd-10 codes from the literature or mapping algorithm.

A pharmaco-epidemiological study based on the norwegian prescription database and cancer registry of norway. The 1-year periodic prevalence of receiving different analgesics and of persistent opioid use were analyzed. Persistent opioid use was defined as >365 defined daily doses or >9000 mg oral morphine equivalents during 365 days with prescriptions in all quarters of the 365 days period. Data were reported for the first 7 years for patients who lived 8-9 years after cancer diagnosis (n = 1502), while for patients who lived 6-7 years (n = 3817) data was reported for the first 5 years after diagnosis.

However, the granularity of the available covariate data may not be sufficiently fine, for example when covariates are measured for participants only when their exposure levels change. To illustrate the impact of choices regarding the frequency of measuring time-varying covariates, we simulated data for a large target trial and for large observational studies, varying in covariate measurement design. Covariates were measured never, on a fixed-interval basis, or each time the exposure level switched. For the analysis, it was assumed that covariates remain constant in periods of no measurement. Cumulative survival probabilities for continuous exposure and non-exposure were estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for time-varying confounding, with special emphasis on the difference between 5-year event risks. With monthly covariate measurements, estimates based on observational data coincided with trial-based estimates, with 5-year risk differences being zero. Without measurement of baseline or post-baseline covariates, this risk difference was estimated to be 49% based on the available observational data. With measurements on a fixed-interval basis only, 5-year risk differences deviated from the null, to 29% for 6-monthly measurements, and with magnitude increasing up to 35% as the interval length increased. Risk difference estimates diverged from the null to as low as -18% when covariates were measured depending on exposure level switching. Our simulations highlight the need for careful consideration of time-varying covariates in designing studies on time-varying exposures. We caution against implementing designs with long intervals between measurements. The maximum length required will depend on the rates at which treatments and covariates change, with higher rates requiring shorter measurement intervals.",34251702

These side effects included blood cell dyscrasias, amenorrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bronchospasm. New findings include enhanced reaction of fd patients to h2 antagonist agents and to serotonin receptor agonists.

We analyzed the change in ambulatory drug utilization before, during, and after the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. We explored dispensing data of nearly 19 000 pharmacies at the expense of the statutory health insurance funds covering 88% of germany's population. We analyzed utilization of publicly discussed drugs with conflicting information. Drug utilization as number of packages dispensed per week from january to june 2020, reflecting 314 million claims, was compared with 2019. Utilization of hydroxychloroquine increased +110% during march 2020 and then slightly decreased until week april 13-19. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and simvastatin/atorvastatin increased, +78% and +74%, respectively, and subsequently decreased below 2019 levels. Utilization of azithromycin and all systemic antibiotics decreased continuously from march 2-8 until june to levels considerably lower compared to 2019 (june 22-28: azithromycin: -55%, all systemic antibiotics: -27%). Pneumococcal vaccines utilization initially increased +373%, followed by supply shortages. Paracetamol utilization showed an initial increase of +111%, mainly caused by an increase of over-the-counter dispensings. Apart from the pandemic itself, the data suggest that dissemination of misinformation and unsound speculations as well as supply shortages influenced drug prescribing, utilization, and purchasing behavior. The findings can inform post-pandemic policy to prevent unfounded over- and underprescribing and off-label use as well as drug shortages during a public health crisis.",34245078

In solid tumor oncology studies, analyses of endpoints such as progression-free survival (pfs) are based on progression events detected by imaging assessments. This study aimed to evaluate the potential bias introduced by differential imaging assessment frequency when using electronic health record (ehr)-derived data to investigate the comparative effectiveness of cancer therapies. Using a nationwide de-identified ehr-derived database, we first analyzed imaging assessment frequency patterns in patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ansclc). We used those rwd inputs to develop a discrete event simulation model of two treatments where disease progression was the outcome and pfs was the endpoint. Using this model, we induced bias with differential imaging assessment timing and quantified its effect on observed versus true treatment effectiveness. We assessed percent bias in the estimated hazard ratio (hr). The frequency of assessments differed by cancer treatment types. In simulated comparative-effectiveness studies, pfs hrs estimated using real-world imaging assessment frequencies differed from the true hr by less than 10% in all scenarios (range: 0.4% to -9.6%). The greatest risk of biased effect estimates was found comparing treatments with widely different imaging frequencies, most exaggerated in disease settings where time to progression is very short. This study provided evidence that the frequency of imaging assessments to detect disease progression can differ by treatment type in real-world patients with cancer and may induce some bias in comparative-effectiveness studies in some situations.",34227170

We assess the feasibility and generalizability of a mobile app for capturing supplemental data during pregnancy. In 2017, we conducted a pilot study of the fda mystudies mobile app within a pregnant population identified through kaiser permanente washington (kpwa), an integrated healthcare delivery system. We ascertained health conditions, medications, and substance use through app-based questionnaires. In a post-hoc analysis, we utilized electronic health records (ehr) to summarize sociodemographic and health characteristics of pilot participants and, for comparison, a pregnant population identified using similar methods. Six percent (64/1070) of contacted women enrolled in the pilot study. Nearly half (23/53) reported taking medication for headaches and one-fourth for constipation (13/53) and nausea (12/53) each. Few instances (2/92) of over-the-counter medication use were identified in electronic dispensing records. One-quarter to one-third of participants with depression and anxiety/panic, respectively, reported recently discontinuing medications for these conditions. Eighty-eight percent of pilot participants reported white race (95%ci: 81-95%), versus 67% of the comparison population (n = 2065). More pilot participants filled ≥1 prescription for antianxiety medication (22% [95%ci: 13-35%]) and antidepressants (19% [95%ci 10-31%]) pre-pregnancy than the comparison population (10 and 9%, respectively).

We conducted a multinational self-controlled case series study using nationwide healthcare databases of south korea (2002-2018), taiwan (2004-2015), and hong kong (2001-2016). Of patients with myocardial infarction who were also prescribed methylphenidate within the observation period, methylphenidate use was classified into four mutually exclusive periods by each person-day: exposed (exposed to methylphenidate), pre-exposure (prior to the first methylphenidate prescription), washout (after the end of methylphenidate treatment), and baseline (unexposed to methylphenidate). Risk of myocardial infarction among the three periods of methylphenidate use was compared to the baseline period using conditional poisson regression analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (irrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis). We identified 2104, 484, and 30 patients from south korea, taiwan, and hong kong, respectively. Risk of myocardial infarction was the highest during the pre-exposure period in all three populations: south korea, pre-exposure (irr 3.17, 95% ci 3.04-3.32), exposed (1.05, 1.00-1.11), washout (1.92, 1.80-2.04); taiwan, pre-exposure (1.97, 1.78-2.17), exposed (0.72, 0.65-0.80), washout (0.56, 0.46-0.68); hong kong, pre-exposure (18.09, 8.19-39.96), exposed (9.32, 3.44-25.28), washout (7.69, 1.72-34.41). Following stratification for age and sex, the trends remained analogous to the main findings across all three populations. Although a positive association between initiating methylphenidate and the onset of myocardial infarction was observed, the risk was the highest in the period before its initiation. Thus, this multinational study suggests there was no causal relationship between methylphenidate and myocardial infarction among asians.",34216049

Data were used from participants aged ≥65 years of the belgian national health survey 2013 (n = 1950). Detailed information was asked on the use of medicines in the past 24 h and linked with prescription data from the belgian compulsory health insurance (bchi). Agreement between polypharmacy (use or prescription ≥5 medicines) and excessive polypharmacy (≥10 medicines) between both sources was assessed with kappa statistics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to study determinants of moderate (5-9 medicines) and excessive polypharmacy (≥10 medicines) and over- and underestimation of prescription based compared to self-reported polypharmacy. Self-reported and prescription based polypharmacy prevalence estimates were respectively 27% and 32%. Overall agreement was moderate, but better in men (kappa 0.60) than in women (0.45). Determinants of moderate polypharmacy did not vary substantially by source of outcome indicator, but restrictions in activities of daily living (adl), living in an institution and a history of a hospital admission was associated with self-reported based excessive polypharmacy only. Surveys and prescription data measure polypharmacy from a different perspective, but overall conclusions in terms of prevalence and determinants of polypharmacy do not differ substantially by data source. Linking survey data with prescription data can combine the strengths of both data sources resulting in a better tool to explore polypharmacy at population level.",34212435

A retrospective study using the data from clinical data analysis and reporting system in hk and iqvia medical research data in the uk. The prevalence of bpd diagnosis in hk and the uk more than doubled during the study period. Some distinct changes in prescribing patterns over time were observed. Lithium use declined by 2.46% and 14.58% in hk and the uk, respectively. By 2018, patients were 4.6 times more likely to receive antidepressant monotherapy in the uk versus hk (15.62% vs. 3.42%). In hk, 38.41% of women of childbearing age were prescribed valproate in 2018 compared with 8.46% in the uk. The prevalence of bpd diagnosis has been increasing in hk and the uk. The disparity in prescribing patterns of bpd maintenance treatment in two regions reflected three major issues in clinical practice: (1) under-prescribing of lithium in both regions, (2) antidepressant monotherapy in the uk and (3) overprescribing of valproate to women of childbearing age in hk. A review of current clinical treatment guidelines and regulations of prescribing practice by local clinicians should be immediately implemented to ensure the safe use of medications in patients with bpd.",34180569

Prevalence of prescription opioid use during pregnancy was calculated for any use, cumulative days of use, and number of dispensings. We examined prevalence of prescription opioid use during pregnancy in each health plan. Tennessee medicaid had appreciably greater prevalence of use compared to the seven other health plans.

The study included 47 071 inpatient hospital cases from eight different study centers. The mean number of different drugs during the entire stay was 6.1 (psychotropic drugs = 2.7; others = 3.4). The mean number of drugs per day was 3.8 (psychotropic drugs = 1.6; others = 2.2). One third of cases received at least five different drugs per day on average during their hospital stay (polypharmacy). Fifty-one percent of patients received more than one psychotropic drug simultaneously. Hospital cases with polypharmacy were 18 years older (p < 0.001), more likely to be female (52% vs. 40%, p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities (5 vs. 2, p < 0.001) than hospital cases without polypharmacy.

As such, chronic conditions and age could modify the effect of vaccines. This study aimed at assessing the potential effect modification of influenza vaccine effectiveness (ive) by age and chronic conditions. We used eight-season data from the portuguese vaccine effectiveness study. Every season, physicians at primary care units recruited patients with influenza-like illness. Clinical data and swabs were collected for reverse transverse polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) detection of influenza. Trivalent inactivated ive was estimated as 1 - odds ratio (or) of being vaccinated in cases (rt-pcr positive for influenza) versus negative controls. Ors were obtained using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model, paired by week of onset within each season. Confounders were assessed by designing a specific causal diagram. Age (< 65 or ≥65 years) and chronic conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, chronic hepatic disease, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, and congenital or acquired immunodeficiency) were studied as effect modifiers by including an interaction term in the regression models. Significance was established at 5%. Point estimates indicate a higher ive in the chronic condition strata compared to that in the no chronic condition strata. Regarding age, different results were obtained considering the virus type and (sub)type. When comparing the ≥65 years with the <65 years of age strata, we observed a higher ive against a(h1n1)pdm09, an equal ive against a(h3n2) and a lower ive against b virus. However, all interaction terms were statistically insignificant, and this may be due to a small sample size. The potential effect modification of age or chronic condition was not observed within our study.",34096151

The european union electronic register of post-authorization studies (eu pas register) was searched to identify studies that assessed the effectiveness of rmms and recruited a target population of healthcare professionals (hcps), sites or patients. Studies with both protocol and report were included and data was extracted from these documents to describe study characteristics and variables involved in the sampling methodology. Out of 1092 studies finalised between june 2017 and may 2019, 17 studies were eligible for review. Thirteen were surveys, three chart reviews and one combined both methodologies. All the 17 studies recruited hcps/sites and 8 of them also recruited patients. The most common rationale for country sampling was market uptake (10/17), while for hcp/site sampling, it was representativeness of the prescribing practices (14/17). Only a minority of the studies (4/17) provided supporting evidence to inform this theoretical framework. Hcp/site sampling frames were mainly network of physicians (5/17) or hcp databases (5/17), with only one study providing a detailed description of the sampling frame. Hcps were selected mainly using probabilistic sampling (10/17) and patients using non-probabilistic sampling (6/8). Only a few studies compared participating with non-participating hcps/sites (5/17) and patients (3/8). Eight studies reported that their results were generalisable. Overall, the study documents provided insufficient details to understand the rationale behind the sampling decisions. More standardisation and guidance in reporting the sampling strategy and operational considerations applicable to these types of studies would support transparency and facilitate the evaluation of representativeness of the study results.",34092001

We conducted a retrospective study using claims data from three data partners (healthcare systems and insurers) in the sentinel distributed database. Algorithms were developed using icd-10-cm diagnosis codes to identify potential stillbirths among females aged 12-55 years between july 2016 and june 2018. A random sample of medical charts (n = 169) was identified for chart abstraction and adjudication. Two physician adjudicators reviewed potential cases to determine whether a stillbirth event was definite/probable, the date of the event, and the gestational age at delivery. Positive predictive values (ppvs) were calculated for the algorithms. Among confirmed cases, agreement between the claims data and medical charts was determined for the outcome date and gestational age at stillbirth. Of the 110 potential cases identified, adjudicators determined that 54 were stillbirth events. Criteria for the algorithm with the highest ppv (82.5%; 95% ci, 70.9%-91.0%) included the presence of a diagnosis code indicating gestational age ≥20 weeks and occurrence of either >1 stillbirth-related code or no other pregnancy outcome code (i.e., livebirth, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion) recorded on the index date. We found ≥90% agreement within 7 days between the claims data and medical charts for both the outcome date and gestational age at stillbirth. Our results suggest that electronic healthcare data may be useful for signal detection of medical product exposures potentially associated with stillbirth.",34089206

Pregnant women were identified with reimbursement codes associated with the delivery of a baby. Data were extracted for three study periods, each over 3 years: 2003-2005, 2009-2011, and 2015-2017. The age-standardized prevalence of dispensed medications during pregnancy were computed and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the trends in prevalence across the study periods. The most frequently dispensed medications were listed for each study period. The study included 23 912 pregnancies. The age-standardized prevalence of pregnant women with at least one dispensed medication increased across the three study periods from 81.8.% to 89.3%. The median number and interquartile range of the different medications dispensed during pregnancy rose from 2 (1-6) to 3 (1-7) between the first and last study periods. In the 2015-2017 period, the most frequently dispensed medications during pregnancy included progesterone (25.5%), paracetamol (17.8%), and amoxicillin (17.1%). The data also showed an increasing trend for the dispensation of ibuprofen and ketorolac during pregnancy across the three study periods. The prevalence of prescribed medications dispensed during pregnancy increased in belgium from 2003 to 2017 with high proportion for progesterone and antibiotics. Utilization of certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) increased between 2003 and 2017, despite recommendations to avoid them.",34053137

However, there is insufficient data on the prevalence and quality of antihypertensive therapy. To describe the prevalence of use and quality of antihypertensive therapy. A cross-sectional study design was used to analyze the 2015 ghana national health insurance scheme (nhis) electronic claims data. Hypertension diagnosis was defined using icd-10 codes. The primary outcomes assessed were the prevalence of use and quality of antihypertensive therapy. Quality of antihypertensive therapy was defined as the use of antihypertensive agents recommended for treating hypertension patients with comorbid heart failure, myocardial infarction/coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or stroke. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify predictors of antihypertensive use and quality of therapy. Antihypertensive medication use was very high (86%) among the 161 873 hypertension patients covered under the ghana nhis. Only a third (32%) of hypertension patients received guideline-concordant therapy. Angiotensin receptor blockers were consumed at the highest dosages of 120 (interquartile range [iqr]: 60, 180) daily defined doses over a year.

Group-based trajectory modelling (gbtm) can be used to identify individuals with similar dose patterns. We provide an intuitive graphical representation of dose patterns in groups identified using gbtm. We illustrate our approach using two drugs with different combinations of available dosages. We drew data on patients with ms followed from 1977 to 2014 in montréal using two sub-cohorts of subjects. A sub-cohort of patients taking interferon-beta-1a and another of patients taking amitriptyline were identified from the initial cohort. We use gbtm to identify groups of patients with homogeneous dose patterns for each of the two drugs. We compared the graphical representation obtained from the fitted values of gbtm with our proposed approach, which consisted of using step functions whose values corresponded to the mode. Differences in characteristics across groups were identified using chi-squares and analysis of variance, both weighted by the posterior probability of group membership. Seven patterns of dose were identified for interferon-beta-1a and five for amitriptyline. The graphical representations of the patterns of dose from gbtm included values outside of the prescribed doses and did not capture changes in dose as clearly as the proposed representation using step functions. Our proposed approach which is based on the mode at each visit in each pattern provides an intuitive and realistic representation of dose patterns in groups identified with gbtm.",34031946

Non-vitamin k oral anticoagulant (noac) and vitamin k antagonists (vka) are used as secondary prophylaxis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utilization of noac and vka, and their impact on re-stroke or death in austria. We analyzed retrospective data between 2012 and 2017 from medical services covered by the health insurance funds, which provides health care for all residents in austria. Patients without anticoagulant medication 3 months preceding the index event were eligible. 76 354 patients were discharged with a hospital diagnosis of stroke. From these, 16 436 patients with a median age of 78 years received vka or noac. After adjustment, the recurrence of stroke was less frequent in patients with noac compared to those with vka (hr 0.87; 95%ci 0.77-0.97).

We assessed the association between hctz exposure and risk of malignant melanoma (mm) and keratinocyte carcinoma (kc) in a european mediterranean population. Two parallel nested case-control studies were conducted in spain using two electronic primary healthcare databases, each one providing data on both exposure and outcomes: sidiap and bifap. Cancer cases were matched to 10 controls by age and gender through risk-set sampling. The ors and 95% ci for mm and kc associated with previous hctz use were estimated using conditional logistic regression. In bifap, kc cases were further identified as basal cell carcinoma (bcc) or squamous cell carcinoma (scc). In adjusted analyses, both ever and cumulative high (≥50,000 mg) use of hctz were associated with an increased risk of kc. The risk estimates for high use were 1.30 (1.26-1.34) in sidiap and 1.20 (1.12-1.30) in bifap, with a lower risk for bcc (1.11 [1.02-1.21]) than for scc (1.71 [1.45-2.02]). A dose-response relationship was observed between cumulative doses of hctz and kc risk. Inconsistent results were found for high use of hctz and risk of mm: 1.25 (1.09-1.43) in sidiap and 0.85 (0.64-1.13) in bifap. In this european mediterranean population, a high cumulative use of hctz was related to an increased risk of kc with a clear dose-response pattern.",34015159

Our aim was to develop a process to incorporate the effect of negative controls into the main analysis of a pssa. Using a previously assessed dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (dh-ccb) and loop diuretic pssa, we directly compared the adjusted sequence ratios (asrs) of dh-ccbs to each of the two negative control index drugs (levothyroxine and angiotensin converting enzyme [ace] inhibitor/angiotensin-2 receptor blocker [arb]) using the ratio of the asrs to estimate a relative asr with a z test. Further, we utilized the relative asr in stratum-specific analyses and varying exposure windows. The relative asr of dh-ccbs decreased from 1.87 to 1.72 (95% ci 1.66-1.78) using levothyroxine as a negative control index drug. Ace inhibitor/arb negative control index drug resulted in an asr of 1.27 thus reducing the relative asr for dh-cbb from 1.84 to 1.45 (95% ci 1.41-1.49). When restricting the exposure window to 180 and 90 days, the relative asr of dh-ccbs increased to 1.68 (95% ci 1.62-1.74) and 1.86 (95% ci 1.78-1.94), respectively, relative to the ace inhibitor/arb negative control index drug. We illustrated how to incorporate negative control index drugs into a pssa and generate relative asrs. Stratum-specific assessments and varying the exposure windows while using negative control index drugs can yield more informative results.",33993606

Although medication-induced delirium in older adults is well understood, limited population-level evidence is available, particularly on combinations of medications associated with delirium in older adults. We aimed to apply association rule analysis to identify drug combinations contributing to delirium risk in adults aged 65 and older using a case-time-control design. We sourced a nationwide representative sample of new zealander's aged ≥65 years from the pharmaceutical collections and hospital discharge information. Prescription records (2005-2015) were obtained from new zealand pharmaceutical collections (pharms). Medication exposures were coded as binary variables (exposed vs. Not exposed) at the individual drug level. All medications, including antimicrobials, antihistamines, diuretics, opioids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, were considered drugs of interest. The first-time coded diagnosis of delirium was extracted from the national minimal dataset (nmds). A unique patient identifier linked the prescription dataset to the event dataset to set up a case-time-control cohort, indexed at the first delirium event. Association rules were then applied to identify frequent drug combinations in the case and the control periods (l-day with a 35-day washout period) that are statistically associated with delirium, and the association was tested by computing a time-trend adjusted matched odds-ratio (mor) and its 95% confidence interval (ci). We identified 28 503 individuals (mean age 84.1 years) from 2005 to 2015 with delirium. Our combined association rule and case-time-control analysis identified several drug classes, including antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, opioids, and diuretics associated with delirium. Our analysis also identified frequently used drug combinations that are associated with delirium. Examples include combined exposures to quetiapine and furosemide (mor = 6.17; 95%ci = [2.05-18.54]), haloperidol (mor = 4.81; 95%ci = [3.16-6.69]), combined exposures to furosemide, omeprazole, and lorazepam (mor = 3.94; 95%ci = [3.03-5.10]), and fentanyl exposure (mor = 3.46; 95%ci [2.05-9.21]). The association rule method applied to a case-time-control design is a novel approach to identifying drug combinations contributing to delirium with adjustment for any temporal trends in exposures. The study provides new insight into the combination of medicines linked to delirium.",33991132

Despite the existence of quantitative bias analysis in pharmacoepidemiologic studies, simultaneously adjusting for unmeasured and partially measured confounders is challenging in vaccine safety studies. Our objective was to develop a flexible approach for conducting sensitivity analyses of unmeasured and partially-measured confounders concurrently for a vaccine safety study. We derived conditional probabilities for an unmeasured confounder based on bias parameters, used these conditional probabilities and monte carlo simulations to impute the unmeasured confounder, and re-constructed the analytic datasets as if the unmeasured confounder had been observed. We simultaneously imputed a partially measured confounder using a prediction model. We considered unmeasured breastfeeding and partially measured family history of type 1 diabetes (t1dm) in a study examining the association between exposure to rotavirus vaccination and t1dm. Before sensitivity analyses, the hazard ratios (hr) were 1.50 (95% ci, 0.81-2.77) for those partially exposed and 1.03 (95% ci, 0.62-1.72) for those fully exposed with unexposed children as the referent group. When breastfeeding and family history of t1dm were adjusted, the hr was 1.55 (95% ci, 0.84-2.87) for the partially exposed group; the hr was 0.98 (95% ci, 0.58-1.63) for the fully exposed group. We conclude that adjusting for unmeasured breastfeeding and partially measured family history of t1dm did not alter the conclusion that there was no evidence of association between rotavirus vaccination and developing t1dm. This novel approach allows for simultaneous adjustment for multiple unmeasured and partially-measured confounders.",33988275

This study ascertained the performance of international classification of diseases (icd) codes for aih, and developed and validated a novel algorithm that reliably identifies patients with aih in health administrative data and claims. This was a cross-sectional study of patients with ≥1 inpatient or ≥2 outpatient icd codes for aih between 2008 and 2019 at a single health system. In a random sample of 250 patients, definite or probable aih was determined using the simplified aih score, revised aih score or expert adjudication. The positive predictive value (ppv) was obtained. Variations of this base algorithm were evaluated using additional criteria to increase its performance. Of the 250 patients, 143 (57.2%) patients had sufficient records available for review. The ppv of the base algorithm was 77.6% (95% ci: 69.9-84.2%). Exclusion of patients with ≥1 icd code for primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis yielded a ppv of 89.7% (95% ci: 82.8-94.6%). Further exclusion of patients with recent immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy increased the ppv to 92.9% (95% ci: 86.5-96.9%). The use of icd codes for aih alone are insufficient to reliably identify patients with aih in health administrative data and claims. Our proposed algorithm that includes additional diagnostic and medication-related coding criteria demonstrates excellent performance.",33979005

Our goal was to examine whether danish findings could be replicated in a us cohort, using a similar study design and analysis. Among non-hispanic white enrollees of kaiser permanente northern california, we conducted an analysis of 9176 melanoma cases and 264 781 controls, matched on age, sex and time in health plan. We examined use of hctz prior to cancer diagnosis (cases) or comparable date for controls, categorized as never use, ever use and high use (≥50 000 mg). Electronic health records provided data on prescriptions, cancer diagnoses, and covariates. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis), adjusted for education, income and number of dermatology, internal medicine and urgent care visits. We observed a small increase in risk of melanoma, all types combined, associated with high use (≥50 000 mg) of hctz (or = 1.11, 95% ci 1.00-1.23) and no evidence of a dose-response.

Validate-j validated claims-based algorithms for selected cancers in japan. Validate-j was a multicenter, cross-sectional, retrospective study. Disease-identifying algorithms were used to identify cancers diagnosed between january or march 2012 and december 2016 using claims data from two hospitals in japan. Positive predictive values (ppvs), specificity, and sensitivity were calculated for prevalent (regardless of baseline cancer-free period) and incident (12-month cancer-free period; with claims and registry periods in the same month) cases, using hospital cancer registry data as gold standard. 22 108 cancers were identified in the hospital claims databases. Ppvs (number of registry cases) for prevalent/incident cases were: any malignancy 79.0% (25 934)/73.1% (18 119); colorectal 84.4% (3519)/65.6% (2340); gastric 87.4% (3534)/76.8% (2279); lung 88.1% (2066)/79.9% (1636); breast 86.4% (4959)/59.9% (3185); pancreatic 87.1% (582)/80.4% (508); melanoma 48.7% (46)/42.9% (36); and lymphoma 83.6% (1457)/77.8% (1035).

Ppvs of claims-based algorithms for several cancers in patients ≥66 years of age were slightly higher than those in a us medicare population. Validate-j demonstrated high specificity and modest-to-moderate sensitivity for claims-based algorithms of most malignancies using japanese claims data. Use of claims-based algorithms will enable identification of patient populations from claims databases, while avoiding direct patient identification.

Adding a prescription for an antiviral did not improve the ppv. However, adding a new code for rash entered within 1 week of the hz code increased the ppv to 100% for definitive and/or probable cases but with substantial loss of sensitivity. A high proportion of children with hz who required inpatient hospitalization had chronic disease (70%) and were on systemic immunomodulatory therapy (50%). Hz can be identified with a high ppv in electronic medical records of children using icd-10 code alone.

Study population comprised community-dwelling patients and nursing homes residents aged 80 and over, who received at least one statin prescription between january 1, 2017 to april 30, 2017 (n = 38 268). Potential statin misuse was identified considering off-label uses, high-intensity doses, drug contraindications and statin-drug interactions. At least one potential statin misuse was detected for 19 468 patients (50.9%). Off-label prescription was the most frequent misuse observed (53.6%), followed by high-intensity statin dose (30.5%). Polypharmacy (five to nine drugs) and excessive polypharmacy (10 or more drugs) were the main risk factors associated with potential statin misuse (adjusted or = 2.6 and 4.7 respectively). Nursing home, multi-morbidity and the presence of multiple prescriptions from different doctors for the same patient were other risk factors significantly associated. Two sensitivity analyzes (reconsiderations of off-label and high statin dose definitions) revealed the same statistical trend. Potential statin misuse is frequent in people aged 80 and over. These findings should serve as a warning to health care professionals and hopefully will contribute to ensure an appropriate and safe use of statin in aged population.",33949722

However, several studies showed poor adherence. Our study aim was to assess the risk of a composite endpoint of major cardiovascular events (mace) and all-cause mortality according to the adherence to these drugs in patients after an acs in a primary health care cohort. Population-based observational cohort study of patients with a first episode of acs during 2009-2016. Information system for research in primary care (sidiap) database. Drug adherence was evaluated through proportion of days covered (pdc). We included 7152 patients and 5692 (79.6%) were adherent (pdc ≥ 75%) to the study drugs during the first year after the event. Adherents to any combination showed a significant reduction of the composite endpoint risk (hr 0.80 [0.73-0.88]), and a significant lower probability of the composite endpoint than nonadherents for all drugs, except beta-blockers. Adherents to 2 (hr 1.2; 95% ci 1.0-1.3) and 1 drug (hr 1.5; 95% ci 1.2-1.8) had higher composite endpoint risk compared to adherents to 4-3 drugs. Adherence to any combination of recommended drugs reduced the composite endpoint risk, regardless the number of drugs prescribed. Adherence to a combination of 4-3 drugs was significantly associated with a reduced mortality risk compared with adherents to 2 or 1, but it was not significant for mace.",33938603

Although there is an increasing use of online surveys to investigate health outcomes, the limits of inference due to drug availability have not been studied. The goal of this study was to quantify the relationship between dispensing of prescription drugs and estimates of use in an online general population survey. An online repeated, cross-sectional survey from 2018 to 2020 was used to estimate the number of adults in the united states who used prescription drugs in the general population and compared to estimated number of prescriptions dispensed over an equivalent time period. Joinpoint regression was used to quantify thresholds. A sample of respondents was retested to estimate reliability statistics. A model with a single threshold was the best fit, with the estimated threshold of 565 000 (95% ci: 9500-11 600 000) prescriptions dispensed per year. Above the threshold, there was a significant association between dispensing and estimates (p < 0.001); below the threshold, the relationship was not significant (p = 0.912). Above the threshold, responses were more reliable than random chance, and reliability steadily increased with increased dispensing. These results suggest the threshold demarcates two distinct pharmacoepidemiological paradigms when investigating drug use in general population surveys. Dispensing can be used as a guide to determine the epidemiological paradigm that is best suited.",33931917

The corr will characterize the role that individual characteristics, household characteristics, and community characteristics have on an individual's risk of opioid use disorder or opioid overdose. Study data sources include the voluntary oregon all payer claims database (apcd), american community survey census data, oregon death certificate data, oregon hospital discharge data (hdd), and oregon prescription drug monitoring (pdmp) data in 2013-2018. To create the corr we first prepared the apcd data set by cleaning and geocoding addresses, creating a community grouper and adding census indices, creating household grouper, and imputing patient race. Then we deployed a probabilistic linkage methodology to incorporate other data sources maintaining compliance with strict data governance regulations. Administrative datasets were obtained through an executed data use agreement with each data owner. The apcd served as the population universe to which all other data sources were linked. There were 3 628 992 unique people in the apcd over the entire study period. We identified 968 767 unique households in 2013 and 1 209 236 in 2018, and geocoded patient addresses representing all census tracts in oregon.

The goal of this study was to assess the willingness of people living with chronic pain to share personal identifiers on the web for the linkage of medico-administrative and patient-reported data. This methodological investigation was achieved in the context of the implementation of the chronic pain treatment (cope) cohort. A web-based recruitment initiative targeting adults living with chronic pain was conducted in the province of quebec (canada). A total of 1935 participants completed the questionnaire (mean age: 49.86 ± 13.27; females: 83.69%), 921 (47.60%) of which agreed to data linkage and shared their personal identifiers (name, date of birth, health insurance number online). The most common reasons for refusal were: (1) concerns regarding data security/privacy (25.71%) and (2) the belief that the requested data were too personal/intrusive (13.52%). Some participants did not understand the relevance of data linkage (11.81%). Participants from the cope cohort and those from the subsample who agreed to data linkage were comparable to other random samples of chronic pain individuals in terms of age and pain characteristics. Although approximately half of the participants refused data linkage, our approach allowed for the implementation of a data platform that contains a diverse and substantial sample. This investigation has also led to the formulation of recommendations for web-based data linkage, including placing items designed to assess willingness to share personal identifiers at the end of the questionnaire, adding explanatory videos, and using a mixed-mode questionnaire.",33901339

Administrative claims data.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.5257,"To use medical record adjudication and predictive modeling methods to develop and validate an algorithm to identify anaphylaxis among adults with type 2 diabetes (t2d) in administrative claims. A conventional screening algorithm that prioritized sensitivity to identify potential anaphylaxis cases was developed and consisted of diagnosis codes for anaphylaxis or relevant signs and symptoms. This algorithm was applied to adults with t2d in the healthcore integrated research database (hird) from 2016 to 2018. Clinical experts adjudicated anaphylaxis case status from redacted medical records. We used confirmed case status as an outcome for predictive models developed using lasso regression with 10-fold cross-validation to identify predictors and estimate the probability of confirmed anaphylaxis. Clinical adjudicators reviewed medical records with sufficient information from 272 adults identified by the anaphylaxis screening algorithm, which had an estimated positive predictive value (ppv) of 65% (95% confidence interval [ci]: 60%-71%). The predictive model algorithm had a c-statistic of 0.95. The model's probability threshold of 0.60 excluded 89% (84/94) of false positives identified by the screening algorithm, with a ppv of 94% (95% ci: 91%-98%). The model excluded very few true positives (15 of 178), and identified 92% (95% ci: 87%-96%) of the cases selected by the screening algorithm. Predictive modeling techniques yielded an accurate algorithm with high ppv and sensitivity for identifying anaphylaxis in administrative claims. This algorithm could be considered in future safety studies using similar claims data to reduce potential outcome misclassification.",33899314

Studies using administrative claims data require the accurate identification of lymphoma cases. We developed and validated an international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification (icd-10-cm)-based algorithm to identify lymphoma in healthcare claims data. We developed a three-component algorithm to identify patients aged ≥15 years who were newly diagnosed with hodgkin (hl) or non-hodgkin (nhl) lymphoma from january 2016 through july 2018 among members of four data partners within the fda's sentinel system. The algorithm identified potential cases as patients with ≥2 icd-10-cm lymphoma diagnosis codes on different dates within 183 days; ≥1 procedure code for a diagnostic procedure (e.g., biopsy, flow cytometry) and ≥1 procedure code for a relevant imaging study within 90 days of the first lymphoma diagnosis code. Cases identified by the algorithm were adjudicated via chart review and a positive predictive value (ppv) was calculated. We identified 8723 potential lymphoma cases via the algorithm and randomly sampled 213 for validation. We retrieved 138 charts (65%) and adjudicated 134 (63%). The overall ppv was 77% (95% confidence interval: 69%-84%). Most cases also had subtype information available, with 88% of cases identified as nhl and 11% as hl. Seventy-seven percent of lymphoma cases identified by an algorithm based on icd-10-cm diagnosis and procedure codes and applied to claims data were true cases. This novel algorithm represents an efficient, cost-effective way to target an important health outcome of interest for large-scale drug safety and public health surveillance studies.",33899311

The uptake of this guidance has not been studied extensively. We reviewed 89 observational effectiveness and safety cohort studies published in six pharmacoepidemiological journals in 2018 and 2019. We developed an extraction tool to assess how frequently new-user and prevalent-user designs were reported to be implemented. For studies that implemented a new-user design in both treatment arms, we extracted information about the extent to which the moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned. Of the 89 studies included, 40% reported implementing a new-user design for both the study exposure arm and the comparator arm, while 13% reported implementing a prevalent-user design in both arms. The moment of meeting eligibility criteria, treatment initiation, and start of follow-up were reported to be aligned in both treatment arms in 53% of studies that reported implementing a new-user design. We provided examples of studies that minimized the risk of introducing bias due to unclear definition of time origin in unexposed participants, immortal time, or a time lag. Almost half of the included studies reported implementing a new-user design. Implications of misalignment of study design origin were difficult to assess because it would require explicit reporting of the target estimand in original studies. We recommend that the choice for a particular study time origin is explicitly motivated to enable assessment of validity of the study.",33899305

However, current data on the care of refugees and migrants in initial reception centers is pending. This article provides data on prescription frequencies of various antibiotics and associated diagnoses. In this retrospective observational study, patient data of 3255 patients with 6376 medical contacts in two initial reception centers in germany were analyzed. Patient data, collected by chart review, included sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses, and prescriptions. Antibiotic prescription behavior and corresponding physician-coded diagnoses were analyzed. Nineteen percent of all patients in our study received systemic antibiotics during the observation period, with children below the age of 10 years receiving antibiotics most frequently (24%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were penicillins (65%), macrolides (12%), and cephalosporins (7%). The most frequent diagnoses associated with antibiotic prescription were acute tonsillitis (26%), bronchitis (21%), infections of the upper respiratory tract (14%), and urinary tract infections (10%). In case of acute bronchitis 74% of the antibiotic prescriptions were probably not indicated. In addition, we found a significant number of inappropriate prescriptions such as amoxicillin for tonsillitis (67%), and ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazol for urinary tract infections (49%). Regarding inappropriate prescription of antibiotics in refugee healthcare, this study shows a rate ranging from 8% for upper respiratory tract infections to 75% for acute bronchitis. Unnecessary use of antibiotics is a global problem contributing to gratuitous costs, side effects, and antimicrobial resistance. This research contributes to the development of stringent antibiotic stewardship regiments in the particularly vulnerable population of migrants and refugees.",33886141

We determined the positive predictive value (ppv) of an icd-10-cm-based diagnostic coding algorithm to identify hospitalization for serious infection among patients dispensed biologic therapy within the fda's sentinel distributed database. We identified health plan members who met the following algorithm criteria: (1) hospital icd-10-cm discharge diagnosis of serious infection between july 1, 2016 and august 31, 2018; (2) either outpatient/emergency department infection diagnosis or outpatient antimicrobial treatment within 7 days prior to hospitalization; (3) inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, or rheumatological diagnosis within 1 year prior to hospitalization, and (4) were dispensed outpatient biologic therapy within 90 days prior to admission. Medical records were reviewed by infectious disease clinicians to adjudicate hospitalizations for serious infection. The ppv (95% confidence interval [ci]) for confirmed events was determined after further weighting by the prevalence of the type of serious infection in the database. Among 223 selected health plan members who met the algorithm, 209 (93.7% [95% ci, 90.1%-96.9%]) were confirmed to have a hospitalization for serious infection. After weighting by the prevalence of the type of serious infection, the ppv of the icd-10-cm algorithm identifying a hospitalization for serious infection was 80.2% (95% ci, 75.3%-84.7%).

Medline and embase were searched for publications between 1987 and 2019 that involved identifying congenital malformations from uk electronic health records using diagnostic codes. The methods and code-lists used to identify congenital malformations, and the methods and results of validations, were examined. We retrieved 54 eligible studies; 36 identified congenital malformations from primary care data and 18 from secondary care data alone or in combination with birth and/or death records. Identification in secondary care data relied on codes from the 'q' chapter for congenital malformations in icd-10. In contrast, studies using primary care data frequently used additional codes outside of the 'p' chapter for congenital malformation diagnoses in read, although the exact codes used were not always clear. Eight studies validated diagnoses identified in primary care data. The positive predictive value was highest (80%-100%) for congenital malformations overall, major malformations, and heart defects although the validity of the reference standard used was often uncertain. It was lowest for neural tube defects (71%) and developmental hip dysplasia (56%). Studies identifying congenital malformations from primary care data provided limited details about the methods used. The few validation studies were limited to diagnoses recorded in primary care. Further assessments of all measures of validity in both data sources and of other malformation subgroups are needed, using robust reference standards and adhering to reporting guidelines.",33881794

Our objective was to assess the association between sglt2-i initiation and gout using a cohort study design and a symmetry analysis. Using the danish nationwide health registries, we conducted an active comparator, new user cohort study comparing the 3-year risk of gout among sglt2-i users with propensity score matched glp1-ra users. Individuals were followed according to the intention-to-treat, and incidence rate differences (ird) and hazard ratios (hr) were obtained. To address unmeasured confounding that is stable over time, a corresponding symmetry analysis was performed. 11 047 pairs of sglt2-i and glp1-ra users were identified, contributing 42 201 person-years of follow-up. The incidence rate of gout was 4.1 and 7.0 events per 1000 person years among sglt2-i and glp1-ra users, yielding an ird of -3.0 (95% confidence interval: -4.4 to -1.5) and hr of 0.58 (0.44 to 0.75). In the symmetry analysis, 80 individuals initiated sglt2-is prior to gout; 118 patients initiated treatment after gout. The trend adjusted sr was 0.63 (0.47 to 0.84) and the active comparator adjusted estimate was 0.67 (0.44 to 0.86).

This study was based on the norwegian mother, father and child cohort study linked to the medical birth registry of norway, the norwegian patient registry (npr) and the norwegian prescription database (norpd). Nsaid exposure was identified by maternal self-report in pregnancy. Child diagnosis of adhd was obtained from npr and norpd. Symptoms of adhd at age 5 years were measured using conners' parent rating scale-revised, where higher scores correspond to more symptoms. To account for time-varying exposure and confounders, marginal structural models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios and mean difference in z-scores. The analyses on adhd diagnosis and adhd symptoms included 56 340 and 34 961 children respectively. Children exposed to nsaids prenatally had no increased risk of adhd diagnosis (first trimester: hr 1.12, 95% ci 0.86;1.45, second trimester: hr 0.98, 95% ci 0.69;1.38, third trimester: hr 0.68, 95% ci 0.31; 1.46) or adhd symptoms (first trimester: standardized mean difference 0.03, 95% ci -0.03;0.09, second trimester: standardized mean difference 0.03, 95% ci -0.04;0.11, third trimester: standardized mean difference 0.11, 95% ci -0.03; 0.25).

We undertook this study to investigate the potential role of pharmacovigilance databases in the surveillance of amr. Using the aware (access, watch and reserve) list and the who priority pathogens list, we established a list of antimicrobials and carried out a vigibase search via vigiaccess, looking for adr reports with preferred terms (pts) that contained amr-relevant information. Identified terms were matched with codes from the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra version 21.1). Records on 86 drugs were retrieved with a total of 1 170 751 adr reports submitted between 1968 and 2018. Seventeen pts suggesting suspected resistance, ineffectiveness, inappropriate use, or medication error were used to code 15 250 reports. The most frequently used pts were ""drug ineffective"" (45.6%), ""off label use"" (9.5%) and ""pathogen resistance"" (8.9%). A group of six agents (amoxicillin, cefalotin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin and daptomycin) accounted for 38% (n = 5806) of all 15 250 amr-relevant adr reports. The pts most frequently used in 5806 reports were grouped in 4 categories: drug ineffectiveness (62.5%), resistance (19.2%), off-label use (12.1%) and prescription errors (6.2%). Our findings suggest that pharmacovigilance databases could serve as a tool in tracking antimicrobial use and resistance especially in settings where laboratory capacity is still in its development stages. National pharmacovigilance centers could play a proactive role in stimulating the reporting of amr-relevant adrs which can serve as a basis for resistance suspicion alerts. Further studies focusing on the narrative and other clinical pharmacology details in adr reports are required.",33864401

We estimated median duration of overall survival (os) and survival rates (6 months, 1, and 2 years) using kaplan-meier methods. We compared our findings to those of clinical trials. Five hundred three patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided into three groups based on the first-line treatment: it 232; tt 157; and cth 114.

This study evaluates the full cohort of signals disseminated from the dutch srs in the period from 2008 to 2017. Each retrieved signal was characterised on a number of aspects. The signal management process from signal generation to a potential pi update was analysed in four steps: (1) signal characterisation; (2) proposed actions by the dutch national competent authority (nca) for the signals; (3) presence of pi update (yes/no) and association with signal characteristics; (4) timing from the moment the signal was issued to pi update. For step 1-3 we stratified products in caps and naps. Of all signals, 88.7% led to a proposed regulatory action by the nca. Signals from the dutch srs for caps versus naps more often concerned biologicals, important medical events, class effects and shorter periods since marketing authorization. We detected pi updates for 26.2% of cap signals and 61.3% of nap signals. The dutch srss remains an important source of signals.

This study investigated strong opioid prescribing in irish general medical services (gms) patients over a 10-year period. A retrospective repeated cross-sectional analysis of a national pharmacy claims database between january 2010 and december 2019 was conducted. Strong opioid prescribing in gms patients was evaluated, including by route of administration, age (16-64 years and ≥65 years) and gender. Measures of consumption included prescribing prevalence and defined daily dose (ddd)/1000 population/day. Prevalence ratios (prs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis), and percentage and absolute changes were determined. Strong opioid prescribing prevalence increased from 14.43% in 2010 to 16.28% in 2019, with the greatest increase in the ≥65 years age group. Tramadol was the most frequently prescribed product, constituting 63.9% of total strong opioid prescribing. The prescribing prevalence of oxycodone increased from 0.95% in 2010 to 2.68% in 2019 (pr 2.81, 95% ci 2.76, 2.87), with steep increases in oxycodone-naloxone since it became available (pr 5.23, 95% ci 4.98, 5.50).

Congenital malformations were identified according to code q00-q89 of the international classification of diseases, 10th revision. All the children who had been diagnosed with cms based on their claims in 2015 and within 1 year from their birth month were selected for this study. The infants' medical records were considered as a gold standard. Positive predictive values (ppvs) for cms were calculated. This study included 227 infants who had a cm diagnosis in their claims. Based on the algorithms established by the quebec pregnancy cohort study group, the ppv for any cm was 90.7% and that for major cms (mcms) was 91.5%. Concerning mcms of specific organ systems, those of the circulatory system (ppv 85.1%) were the most frequent, followed by cleft lip and cleft palate (ppv 100.0%), and other cms of the digestive system (ppv 96.4%). Based on the eurocat classification, the ppv for any mcm was 88.5%. Specific mcms reported in ≥20 infants were ventricular septal defect (ppv 96.0%), patent ductus arteriosus (ppv 72.7%) and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (ppv 100.0%). The ppvs for cms in the japanese administrative data were high enough to suggest that these data could be utilized for perinatal pharmacoepidemiological evaluations. The results were from a single center, and further validation studies are needed.",33835610

However, the issue of missing data is often exacerbated in mdbs, potentially resulting in bias and precision loss. We sought to measure how missing data are being recorded and addressed in pharmacoepidemiologic mdbs. We conducted a systematic literature search in pubmed for pharmacoepidemiologic mdbs published between 1st january 2018 and 31st december 2019. Included studies were those that used ≥2 distinct databases to assess the same safety/effectiveness outcome associated with a drug exposure. Outcome variables extracted from the studies included strategies to execute a mdbs, reporting of missing data (type, bias evaluation) and the methods used to account for missing data. Two thousand seven hundred and twenty-six articles were identified, and 62 studies were included: using data from either north america (56%), europe (31%), multiple regions (11%) or east-asia (2%). Thirty-five (56%) articles reported missing data: 11 of these studies reported that this could have introduced bias and 19 studies reported a method to address missing data. Thirteen (68%) carried out a complete case analysis, 2 (11%) applied multiple imputation, 2 (11%) used both methods, 1 (5%) used mean imputation and 1 (5%) substituted information from a similar variable. Just over half of the recent pharmacoepidemiologic mdbs reported missing data and two-thirds of these studies reported how they accounted for it. We should increase our vigilance for database completeness in mdbs by reporting and addressing the missing data that could introduce bias.",33834576

Data from the cancer registry of norway were linked to the norwegian prescription database for a study population of 3.52 million individuals. Prevalence ratios (prs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) of prescribed drugs in crc-survivors compared to the cancer-free population, were estimated by log-binomial regression, adjusting for age and education. Almost 27 000 individuals, aged 20 to 84, were diagnosed with crc during 2005 to 2014. The first year after diagnosis, the prevalence of prescribed drugs was higher in crc-survivors compared with the cancer-free population, especially drugs for anxiety and tension, and steroid-responsive conditions. Prs for several drugs, especially drugs used for mental and behavioural disorders, decreased with time since diagnosis. The prevalence of drugs used for anxiety and tension was elevated 10 years after diagnosis; prs the first year after diagnosis were 20 (95% ci: 18-22) in males and 17 (16-18) in females. Ten years after diagnosis prs were 5.0 (3.1-7.9) and 2.0 (1.0-3.8), respectively. In absolute numbers, the largest increase, compared to the cancer-free population, was in drugs used for gastric acid disorders and pain. The prevalence of neuromodulatory drugs was higher in crc-survivors. The prevalence of several drugs was higher in crc-survivors than in the cancer-free population 10 years after diagnosis. The largest absolute excess in prevalence was for gastric acid disorder and pain medications, while the relative prevalence of drugs used for anxiety and tension was high in crc-survivors.

To assess adherence to doacs in atrial fibrillation patients in every day practice and identify predictors for non-adherence. Individual linked dispensing data of atrial fibrillation patients who used doacs were obtained from the foundation for pharmaceutical statistics covering the netherlands between 2012 and 2016. One year adherence to doac was calculated for initial doac as proportion of days covered (pdc) ≥80% and the association between clinical variables and adherence was assessed using logistic regression. In addition, we measured non-persistence, that is, patients who completely stopped their initial doac within 1 year follow-up. A total of 4797 apixaban-, 20 454 rivaroxaban- and 18 477 dabigatran users were included. The mean age was 69 years (n = 43 910), which was similar for the doac types. The overall proportion of patients with pdc ≥80% was 76%, which was highest for apixaban- (87%), followed by dabigatran- (80%) and rivaroxaban (69%) users. Multivariable analyses revealed that age ≤60 years, no concomitant drug use were predictors for non-adherence. Of atrial fibrillation patients who continued treatment, 97% had a pdc ≥80%, compared with only 56% for those who discontinued their doac treatment within 1 year. Non-adherence to doacs was associated with age ≤60 years and no concomitant drugs use. Non-adherence was higher in patients who later discontinued doac treatment.

This study compared the incidence of opioid prescribing in women undergoing pop transabdominal repair with mesh and transvaginal native tissue repair. A retrospective cohort of women undergoing pop transabdominal repair with mesh or transvaginal native tissue repair, was derived from a 10% random sample of enrollees from 2007 to 2015 within the iqvia pharmetrics® plus database. Primary outcomes were any prescription of opioids and cumulative days of opioids prescribed in the 14- 180 days following surgical intervention. Inverse probability of treatment weights controlled for observed baseline confounders. Any opioid prescription was estimated using logistic regression and generalized linear regression for cumulative days of opioids prescribed. The cohort of 49 052 women who underwent pop surgical repair included 46 813 women with transvaginal native tissue repair and 2239 women with transabdominal repair with mesh. Women with a transabdominal repair with mesh had a 1.19 (95%ci: 1.09-1.31) significantly higher odds of receiving an opioid prescription than women with transvaginal native tissue repair. Post-operatively, over 29% of women received opioid prescriptions. Mean cumulative days of post-surgical opioid prescribing was 32.2 (sd = 43.1), and was not statistically different between groups. Thirteen percent of women were prescribed opioids for 90 days or more. Women undergoing pop with transabdominal mesh are more likely to receive prescriptions for opioids after surgery compared to transvaginal native tissue repair. Treatment plans that address pain while mitigating the risks associated with prolonged opioid prescribing should be employed.",33797822

Fda's role in the covid-19 pandemic response has necessitated an expansion and enhancement of sentinel. Here we describe how the sentinel system has supported fda's response to the covid-19 pandemic. We highlight new capabilities developed, key data generated to date, and lessons learned, particularly with respect to working with inpatient electronic health record data. Early in the pandemic, sentinel developed a multi-pronged approach to support fda's anticipated data and analytic needs. It incorporated new data sources, created a rapidly refreshed database, developed protocols to assess the natural history of covid-19, validated a diagnosis-code based algorithm for identifying patients with covid-19 in administrative claims data, and coordinated with other national and international initiatives.

We compared the risk of treatment failure of antibiotic regimens for outpatient treatment of uti in real-world practice. We identified non-pregnant, premenopausal women diagnosed with uncomplicated, lower tract uti and prescribed an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens. We used propensity score-weighted kaplan-meier functions to estimate 30-day risks and risk differences (rd) for pyelonephritis and uti-related antibiotic prescription switch. Of 1 140 602 patients, the distribution of index prescriptions was 44% fluoroquinolones (non-first-line), 28% trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx) (first-line), 24% nitrofurantoin (first-line), 3% narrow-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), 1% broad-spectrum β-lactams (non-first-line), and 1% amoxicillin/ampicillin (non-recommended). Compared to the risk of pyelonephritis for nitrofurantoin (0.3%), risks were higher for tmp/smx (rd, 0.2%; 95% ci, 0.2%-0.2%) and broad-spectrum β-lactams (rd, 0.2%; 95% ci, 0.1%-0.4%). Compared to the risk of prescription switch for nitrofurantoin (12.7%), the risk was higher for tmp/smx (rd 1.6%; 95% ci 1.3%-1.7%) but similar for broad-spectrum β-lactams (rd -0.7%; 95% ci -1.4%-0.1%) and narrow-spectrum β-lactams (rd -0.3%; 95% ci -0.8%-0.2%). Subgroup analyses suggest tmp/smx treatment failure may be due in part to increasing uropathogen resistance over time. The risk of treatment failure differed by antibiotic agent, with higher risk associated with tmp/smx versus nitrofurantoin, and lower or similar risk associated with broad- versus narrow-spectrum β-lactams. Given serious safety warnings for fluoroquinolones, these results suggest that nitrofurantoin may be preferable as the first-line agent for outpatient treatment of uncomplicated uti.",33783918

We described adr reporting and its trend from 1999 to 2017 and estimated the adr underreporting in the iranian pharmacovigilance center. We expressed the number of adr reporting per inhabitants and admissions and their possible trends. Finally, adr underreporting percentages were estimated by three approaches: prospective studies, literature review, stratification of the country; and the trend of the proportion of adr per inhabitants was corrected. The proportion of adr reporting was 15.3 per 100 000 inhabitants (95% ci: 15.2, 15.8) and 10.0 per 100 000 admissions (95% ci: 9.8, 10.2) in 2017, and its trend was increasing with 16.3% average change per annum during 19 years.

It is well-known that these agents can prolong the qtc interval and potentially induce torsades de pointes (tdp). We aim to assess the prevalence and risk of qtc prolongation and arrhythmic events in covid-19 patients treated with these drugs. We searched electronic databases from inception to september 30, 2020 for studies reporting peak qtc ≥500 ms, peak qtc change ≥60 ms, peak qtc interval, peak change of qtc interval, ventricular arrhythmias, tdp, sudden cardiac death, or atrioventricular block (avb). All meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Forty-seven studies (three case series, 35 cohorts, and nine randomized controlled trials [rcts]) involving 13 087 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of peak qtc ≥500 ms was 9% (95% confidence interval [95%ci], 3%-18%) and 8% (95%ci, 3%-14%) in patients who received hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin, respectively. Likewise, the use of hydroxychloroquine (risk ratio [rr], 2.68; 95%ci, 1.56-4.60) and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (rr, 3.28; 95%ci, 1.16-9.30) was associated with an increased risk of qtc prolongation compared to no treatment. Ventricular arrhythmias, tdp, sudden cardiac death, and avb were reported in <1% of patients across treatment groups. The only two studies that reported individual data of lopinavir/ritonavir found no cases of qtc prolongation. Covid-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine with or without azithromycin had a relatively high prevalence and risk of qtc prolongation. However, the prevalence of arrhythmic events was very low, probably due to underreporting. The limited information about lopinavir/ritonavir showed that it does not prolong the qtc interval.",33772933

The objective of this study was to assess the impact on the reporting trends in vaccine reports and on signal detection for vaccines. For assessment of the impact on the reporting trends, we performed the joinpoint trend analysis and descriptively considered number of vaccine reports grouped by the timing of the regulation change. For assessment of the impact on signal detection, we performed signal detection using dataset during the pre or postperiod of the regulation changes, and compared their agreement rates, which was calculated with a reference set for vaccines, created by the global research in paediatrics project. We retrieved 467 635 spontaneous reports, including 12 287 vaccine reports from april 2004 to march 2019. The average number of vaccine reports per year increased from 231 reports during the preperiod to 1227 during the postperiod. The joinpoint trend analysis found two joinpoints and differentiated three trends, significant increased trend of which was observed when regulations had changed. For signal detection, the agreement rate was improved when using data during the postperiod. We concluded that the regulation changes increased the number of vaccine reports, and could have improved signal detection performance for vaccines by accelerating accumulation of reports, while more spontaneous reports are necessary to optimize signal detection.",33733540

Repeating caliper and nn caliper matching in the same cohort yielded large variations in effect estimates, in all 36 scenarios, with both types of matching. The largest variation was found in smaller cohorts, where the odds ratio (or) ranged from 0.53 to 10.00 (iqr of ors: 1.11-1.67). The 95% confidence interval was not consistently overlapping a neutral association after repeating the matching with both algorithms. We confirmed these findings in a noninterventional example study.

Parallel retrospective cohort studies were conducted in the united states department of defense military health system database (dod) and the healthcore integrated research database (hird). Study patients were treated for atrial fibrillation (af) with dronedarone, amiodarone, sotalol, or flecainide. Propensity score matching was employed to create analysis cohorts balanced on baseline variables considered potential confounders of treatment decisions. The study period of july 20, 2008 through september 30, 2014 included a 1-year baseline and minimum 6 months of follow-up, for patients with drugs dispensed between july 20, 2009 and march 31, 2014. Suspect ild outcomes were reviewed by independent adjudicators. Cox proportional hazards regression compared risk of confirmed ild between dronedarone and each comparator cohort. A sensitivity analysis examined the effect of broadening the outcome definition. A total 72 ild cases (52 dod; 20 hird) were confirmed among 27 892 patients. Ild risk was significantly higher among amiodarone than dronedarone initiators in dod (hr = 2.5; 95% ci = 1.1-5.3, p = 0.02). No difference was detected in hird (hr = 1.0; 95% ci = 0.4-2.4). Corresponding risks in sotalol and flecainide exposure groups did not differ significantly from dronedarone in either database. Ild risk among af patients initiated on dronedarone therapy was comparable to or lower than that of amiodarone initiators, and similar to that of new sotalol or flecainide users. This finding suggests that elevated ild risk associated with amiodarone does not necessarily extend to dronedarone or other antiarrhythmic drugs.",33730412

The ppv of the algorithm requiring ≥2 icd-9 diagnosis codes and ≥1 prescription claim for pso treatment excluding topical steroids was 81.1% but higher (82.5%) when ≥1 diagnosis was from a dermatologist. Among 411 pso patients with adequate information on pso disease activity in ehrs, 1.5-5.8% had no disease activity, 31.3-36.8% mild, and 26.9-35.1% moderate-to-severe across the algorithms. Claims-based algorithms based on a combination of pso diagnosis codes and dispensing for pso-specific treatments had a moderate-to-high ppv. These algorithms can serve as a useful tool to identify patients with pso in future real-world data pharmacoepidemiologic studies.",33715280

A key component of precision medicine is the use of genetic information to improve therapeutic effectiveness of drugs and prevent potential adverse drug reactions. Pharmacoepidemiology, as a field, uses observational methods to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drug treatments in populations. Pharmacoepidemiology by virtue of its focus, tradition, and research orientation can provide appropriate study designs and analysis methods for precision medicine. The objective of this manuscript is to demonstrate how pharmacoepidemiology can impact and shape precision medicine and serve as a reference for pharmacoepidemiologists interested in contributing to the science of precision medicine. This paper depicts the state of the science with respect to the need for pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoepidemiological methods, tools and approaches for precision medicine; the need for and how pharmacoepidemiologists use their skills to engage with the precision medicine community; and recommendations for moving the science of precision medicine pharmacoepidemiology forward. We propose a new integrated multidisciplinary approach dedicated to the emerging science of precision medicine pharmacoepidemiology.",33715268

The international society for pharmacoepidemiology (ispe) funded a working group of ispe members to develop guidance material for the application and reporting of self-controlled study designs, similar to standards of reporting observational epidemiology (strobe). This first paper focuses on navigation between the types of self-controlled designs to permit a foundational understanding with guiding principles. We leveraged a systematic review of applications of these designs, that we term self-controlled crossover observational pharmacoepidemiologic (scope) studies. Starting from first principles and using case examples, we reviewed outcome-anchored (case-crossover [cco], case-time control [ctc], case-case-time control [cctc]) and exposure-anchored (self-controlled case-series [sccs]) study designs. Key methodological features related to exposure, outcome and time-related concerns were clarified, and a common language and worksheet to facilitate the design of scope studies is introduced. Consensus on conceptual foundations, terminology and relationships among scope designs will facilitate understanding and critical appraisal of published studies, as well as help in the design, analysis and review of new scope studies.

Nevertheless, there were inconsistent results among studies. To investigate the relationship between -759c/t, functional polymorphism of the htr2c gene and metabolic adverse effects in thai psychiatric patients treated with risperidone monotherapy. In this cross-sectional study, 108 psychiatric patients treated with risperidone monotherapy for ≥3 months were recruited. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests were obtained upon enrollment and history of treatment was reviewed from medical records. Weight gain was defined as an increase ≥7% of baseline weight. Metabolic syndrome was evaluated according to the 2005 international diabetes federation (idf) asia criteria. The -759c/t, polymorphism was genotyped. The associations between -759c/t polymorphism and metabolic side effects were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used for determining potential confounders. Neither weight gain nor metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with -759c/t allelic and genotype variants of htr2c. However, t allele of -759c/t polymorphism significantly associated with the hypertension. This association was not affected by possible confounding factors such as gender, risperidone dose, duration of treatment and family history of hypertension. Our findings suggest that psychiatric patients with t allele of -759c/t polymorphism may be at higher risk for hypertension.

Through the utilization of the healthcare databases of the lombardy region, italy, we identified two retrospective cohorts of patients aged 65 years or more, who died in 2018 and had a diagnosis of either a solid cancer (n = 19 367) or a chronic progressive disease (n = 27 819). We estimated prescription of eight major classes of preventive drugs 1 year and 1 month before death; continuation or initiation of preventive drug use during the last month of life was also investigated. Over the last year of life, in both oncologic and non-oncologic patients, we observed a modest decrease in the prescription of blood glucose-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensives, lipid-modifying agents, and bisphosphonates, and a slight increase in the prescription of vitamins, minerals, antianemic drugs, and antithrombotic agents (among oncologic patients only). One month before death, the prescription of preventive drugs was still common, particularly for anti-hypertensives, antithrombotics, and antianemics, with more than 60% of patients continuing to be prescribed most preventive drugs and an over 10% starting a therapy with an antithrombotic, an antianemic, or a vitamin or mineral supplement.

To evaluate whether women and men are prescribed the same dose a cohort analysis was performed in the population-based rotterdam study (rs). Results were replicated in the integrated primary care information (ipci) database of automated general practice data. The mean daily starting doses of metoprolol in both sexes were compared with independent-samples t-tests and a linear regression analysis was used to adjust in the rs for co-variables, notably, cardiovascular comorbidity, migraine, age, sbp, dbp, bmi, socioeconomic status, use of other antihypertensive drugs, smoking, and alcohol. In the ipci-database, adjustment was for age only. The mean daily starting dose was statistically significantly lower in women than in men in both the rs and ipci database, with a mean difference of 4.8 mg (95%ci -7.8, -1.8) and 4.6 mg (95%ci -5.3,-4.0), respectively. Statistical significance remained after adjustment in both databases. Women received lower starting doses of metoprolol than men in two independent data collections despite non-sex specific cardiovascular guideline recommendations.

We conducted a validation study among patients in the uk-based cprd gold with linkage to hes (1998 to 2017). Since the same surgery codes are used for bariatric and other gastrointestinal surgery we assessed code distribution patterns used in patients with bariatric versus other gastrointestinal surgery by presence of other conditions such as obesity and gastrointestinal cancer. We developed algorithms to identify bariatric surgery and calculated validity measures (ie, positive/negative predictive value [ppv/npv], sensitivity, and specificity) of each in cprd gold compared with hes (gold standard). Among 7 357 007 available patients we identified 10 190 patients who had a total of 14 046 potential bariatric surgery codes in cprd gold and/or hes. Surgery code patterns differed between bariatric surgery and assumed other gastrointestinal surgery. The sensitivity of cprd gold bariatric surgery coding improved from an overall of 56% to 69-71% when applying stricter algorithms (ie, in obese patients or obese, gastrointestinal disease/complication free patients) but ppvs remained at 53%-55%. Npvs and specificities of cprd gold bariatric surgery coding achieved ≥99.8% for all algorithms. Our results suggest that using cprd gold and hes data and a wide selection of surgery codes will result in the most complete and accurate capture of bariatric surgery events. Validity measures of cprd gold bariatric surgery codes were identical in obese patients and more restrictive populations.",33675245

Our study included adults prescribed an oral fluoroquinolone or comparator antibiotic between january 2000 and september 2015 for acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, uncomplicated urinary tract infection, or acute bronchitis. Our outcomes were cns dysfunction, and four separate but complementary pns dysfunction outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models were estimated after matching on propensity scores fitted using the variables age, sex, epilepsy, hereditary peripheral neuropathy, renal dysfunction, diabetes, gabapentinoid use, statin use, isoniazid use, and chemotherapy use. Our cohort contained 976 568 individuals exposed to a fluoroquinolone antibiotic matched 1:1 with a comparator. Matching produced balance (standardized mean difference <0.1) on all variables included in the propensity score. The hazard ratio associated with fluoroquinolone exposure was 1.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05-1.11) for cns dysfunction, and 1.09 (95% ci 1.07-1.11) for the most commonly occurring pns dysfunction outcome.

We focused on methotrexate, a broadly used drug unrelated to covid-19, and (hydroxy)chloroquine, another broadly used drug implicated in covid-19 treatment. Using descriptive statistics, we compared reporting characteristics before and after the covid-19 outbreak. During the study period, 366 998 cases (60% female, median age: 59 years) were submitted to faers. The daily median number of reports (1796 in the pre-pandemic, 1810 in the second pandemic time interval) and other characteristics remained stable. The daily median number of reports for methotrexate decreased from 28 in the pre-pandemic to 15 in the second pandemic time interval, with no considerable differences in other characteristics. The daily median number of reports for (hydroxy)chloroquine increased slightly from 1 in the pre-pandemic to 3 in the second pandemic time interval, while there were also changes in the demographics of cases and an increase in the proportion of cases reported by health professionals. The overall reporting to faers did not change after the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic.

We evaluated coding trends in health outcomes in the us food and drug administration's sentinel system during the transition. We reviewed all health outcomes coding trends reports on the sentinel website through november 30, 2019 and analyzed trends in incidence and prevalence across the icd-9-cm and icd-10-cm eras by visual inspection. We identified 78 unique health outcomes (22 acute, 32 chronic, and 24 acute or chronic) and 140 time-series graphs of incidence and prevalence. The reports also included code lists and code mapping methods used. Of the 140 graphs reviewed, 81 (57.9%) showed consistent trends across the icd-9-cm and icd-10-cm eras, while 51 (36.4%) and 8 (5.7%) graphs showed inconsistent and uncertain trends, respectively. Chronic hois and acute/chronic hois had higher proportions of consistent trends in prevalence definitions (83.9% and 78.3%, respectively) than acute hois (28.6%). For incidence, 55.6% of acute hois showed consistent trends, while 41.2% of chronic hois and 39.3% of acute/chronic hois showed consistency. Researchers using icd-10-cm algorithms obtained by standardized mappings from icd-9-cm algorithms should assess the mapping performance before use. The sentinel reports provide a valuable resource for researchers who need to develop and assess mapping strategies. The reports could benefit from additional information about the algorithm selection process and additional details on monthly incidence and prevalence rates. We reviewed health outcomes coding trends reports on the us fda sentinel website through november 30, 2019 and analyzed trends in incidence and prevalence across the international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (icd-9-cm) and icd-10-cm eras by code mapping method and the type of health outcomes of interest (acute, chronic, acute or chronic). More than a third of the 140 time-series graphs of incidence and prevalence of health outcomes showed inconsistent or uncertain trends. Consistency in trends varied by code mapping method, type of health outcomes of interest, and whether the measurement was incidence or prevalence.

Nineteen countries targeted for database reporting were identified using published country lists and review articles. Surveillance capacity was assessed using two surveys: a 9-item introductory survey and a 51-item full survey. Survey questions related to database characteristics, covariate and health outcome variables, vaccine exposure characteristics, access and governance, and dataset linkage capability. Other questions collated research/regulatory applications of the data and local publications detailing database use for research. Eleven databases containing vaccine-specific information were identified across 8 countries. Databases were largely national in coverage (8/11, 73%), encompassed all ages (9/11, 82%) with population size from 1.4 to 52 million persons. Vaccine exposure information varied particularly for standardized vaccine codes (5/11, 46%), brand (7/11, 64%) and manufacturer (5/11, 46%). Outcome data were integrated with vaccine data in 6 (55%) databases and available via linkage in 5 (46%) databases. Data approval processes varied, impacting on timeliness of data access. Variation in vaccine data availability, complexities in data access including, governance and data release approval procedures, together with requirement for data linkage for outcome information, all contribute to the challenges in building a distributed network for vaccine safety assessment in the asia-pacific and globally.

This prospective study was conducted in the emergency department of our hospital from april 1, 2017 to december 31, 2019. Ades of patients admitted to the emergency department were collected by a clinical pharmacist during daily pharmacy rounds. Of 4020 cases admitted to the emergency department, 198 emergency ade-related hospitalizations (4.93%) were noted, which were classified into certain (n = 0, 0%), probable (n = 122, 61.6%), and possible (n = 76, 38.4%). The ade was serious in 93.9% of the 198 cases. Ten cases were fatal, and two cases were life-threatening. More than 80% of the emergency ade-related hospitalization cases were of patients over 60 years. The pharmacological agents implicated in the hospitalizations were oral antiplatelet agents (20.7%), oral hypoglycemic agents (16.7%), insulin (11.1%), and antihypertensive agents (9.1%). The average length of ade-related hospital stay was 10 (7.0-14.0) days. Ade-related costs ranged from $1684.68 to $4531.35 for each hospitalization. The length of ade-related hospital stay and associated costs were statistically significant. Most ades (n = 146, 73.7%) were preventable. Most emergency ade-related hospitalizations in older adults resulted from lack of medication monitoring or inappropriate medication.

The aim of this study was to present the main characteristics of this consumption in french workers and to identify changes from the 1986, 1996, 2006 and 2016 surveys. The design was a repeated cross-sectional study in 1986, 1996, 2006 and 2016. At each wave, demographic and socio-professional characteristics, self-reported consumption of medications during the week before the occupational medical visit, and perceived difficult working conditions and extraprofessional problems were collected among a sample of workers. Factors associated with consumption of any drug and of main therapeutic classes were investigated through multivariate logistic regression models, using 2016 as the reference for investigating temporal trends. Prevalence of use of any drug was significantly higher in 2016, with marked changes observed in comparison with 1986: absolute decrease of psychotropic (-5.1%, p < 0.0001), antibiotics (-2.7%, p < 0.0001) and cardiovascular drug use (-3.8%, p < 0.0001), increase of analgesic use (+8.3%, p < 0.0001). Difficult working conditions, age and female gender were independently associated with analgesic drug use, and extraprofessional problems and female gender associated with psychotropic drug use. This analysis of self-reported drug use in the working environment illustrates the global patterns of medication use in a french active population over 3 decades. The favorable development in the level of consumption of psychotropic drugs should not underestimate the attention to be paid to the determinants of chronic consumption, or possible transfers to less stigmatized medications.",33625778

Approximately 34% of chronic users developed constipation, 20% experienced falls, and 8% reported dizziness. Among endometriosis patients, women in younger age groups, those with other comorbidities associated with pain symptoms, as well as those with depression or anxiety were at a higher risk of developing chronic opioid use. Women with endometriosis had a four times greater risk of chronic opioid use compared to women without. Multimorbidity among these patients was associated with the elevated risk of chronic opioid use and should be taken into account during treatment selection.",33611812

We aimed to evaluate patient characteristics and representativeness of tcm patients in cgrd. We identified a cohort of patients who had tcm records both from cgrd and from taiwan's national health insurance database (nhird) during 2010-2015 to investigate the representativeness of cgrd for tcm uses. The nhird was considered as reference because it covers all medical claims from 99.9% of the entire taiwanese population. We investigated the coverage rates of tcm patients within cgrd compared to nhird, and compared the characteristics of patients between cgrd and nhird including age, sex, and 15 health conditions. We identified 71 002 average annual patients within the cgrd, which accounted for 1.1% of the patients from the nhird. The patients from cgrd were older than those from nhird (≥65: 16.6% vs. 9.9% for cgrd vs. Nhird). The ratios of female over male patients were 1.7 vs. 1.5 for cgrd vs. Nhird. We found higher patient coverage rates for patients with major comorbidities in cgrd, specifically for neoplasm (9.2%) and mental disorders (6.0%). The most frequently prescribed chinese herbal medicines in cgrd included jia-wei-xiao-yao-san, xiang-sha-liu-jun-zi-tang and gui-lu-er-xian-jiao. Higher patient coverage rates were found in cgrd for tcm patients with major comorbidities. Investigators should note possible selection bias since tcm patient disorders may be more severe in cgrd than in the nhird.",33611792
318,Takeuchi M;Kawakami K,2021,Association of baloxavir marboxil prescription with subsequent medical resource utilization among school-aged children with influenza.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.5207,"Baloxavir marboxil is a novel antiviral agent for influenza, introduced into clinical practice in 2018. A concern remains about the variant virus with reduced susceptibility after baloxavir exposure and its clinical consequences such as healthcare-seeking behavior. Using a healthcare database in japan, we compared the medical resource use following baloxavir and neuraminidase inhibitors (nais) treatment among children aged 7-15 years. The study period was from december 2018 to march 2019. The primary endpoint was the composite of hospitalization, laboratory and radiological tests, and antibiotic use over 1-9 days of antiviral treatment. As exploratory analyses, secondary outcomes being each single component of the primary composite were assessed and subgroup analyses comparing baloxavir with each nai were done. Data from 115 867 prescriptions in 115 238 children were analyzed (median age: 10 years; severe influenza risk in 26%; baloxavir accounting for 43%). Overall, baloxavir use did not increase subsequent medical resource utilization in the composite endpoint (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.99-1.09; p = 0.14), as were likelihoods of other secondary outcomes. In the subgroup analysis, baloxavir use was associated with higher medical resource use than oseltamivir (aor: 1.21; 95% ci: 1.13-1.31; p < 0.001) and lower resource use than zanamivir (aor: 0.93; 95% ci 0.86-1.00; p = 0.040). Based on a single-year experience in japan, prescribing baloxavir rather than nais did not increase medical resource utilization within 9 days of treatment, except in one exploratory comparison with oseltamivir.",33608939

However, clinical trials have documented an increased risk of lower extremity amputations (lea) associated with canagliflozin. We applied machine learning methods to predict lea among diabetes patients treated with canagliflozin. Using claims data from a 5% random sample of medicare beneficiaries, we identified 13 904 diabetes individuals initiating canagliflozin between april 2013 and december 2016. The samples were randomly and equally split into training and testing sets. We identified 41 predictor candidates using information from the year prior to canagliflozin initiation, and applied four machine learning approaches (elastic net, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [lasso], gradient boosting machine and random forests) to predict lea risk after canagliflozin initiation. The incidence rate of lea was 0.57% over a median 1.5 years follow-up. Lasso produced the best prediction, yielding a c-statistic of 0.81 (95% ci: 0.76, 0.86). Among individuals categorized in the top 5% of the risk score, the actual incidence rate of lea was 3.74%. Among the 16 factors selected by lasso, history of lea [adjusted odds ratio (aor): 33.6 (13.8, 81.9)] and loop diuretic use [aor: 3.6 (1.8,7.3)] had the strongest associations with lea incidence. Our machine learning model efficiently predicted the risk of lea among diabetes patients undergoing canagliflozin treatment. The risk score may support optimized treatment decisions and thus improve health outcomes of diabetes patients.",33606340

However, the association remains poorly understood with previous studies obtaining conflicting results. To examine the effect of statin on the subsequent risk of diverticular disease. We conducted a nested case-control study in denmark among respondents (>18 years) of the 2010 or the 2013 danish national health survey. Among these, we identified 8809 cases of hospital-diagnosed diverticular disease and risk-set sampled population controls without diverticular disease. Using complete prescription and hospital records, we used conditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios (ors) associating statin use with diverticular disease. In adjusted analyses, we controlled for hospital-based diagnoses, medication use other than statins, and lifestyle and socioeconomic factors. The fully adjusted or for diverticular disease associated with ever use (≥1 statin prescription filling) was 1.19 (95% ci: 1.12-1.27) compared with never use. However, we observed no dose-response relation. For example, among short-term users (<5 years), the or was 1.18 (95% ci: 1.04-1.35) for low intensity users and 1.13 (95% ci: 1.01-1.26) for high intensity users. Among long-term users (≥5 years), the respective ors were 1.25 (95% ci: 1.13-1.38) and 1.11 (95% ci: 0.98-1.24). In analyses restricting to cases and controls with a previous colonoscopy, associations were null (or: 1.01 [95% ci: 0.85-1.20]). The observed association of a higher risk of diverticular disease associated with statins could be explained by diagnostic bias. Our study did not support a protective nor harmful effect of statins on the risk of diverticular disease.",33583126

We sought to evaluate the predictive validity of a us icd-10 cci adaptation in us claims and compare it with the canadian standard. Diverse patient cohorts (rheumatoid arthritis, hip/knee replacement, lumbar spine surgery, acute myocardial infarction [ami], stroke, pneumonia) in the ibm® marketscan® research databases were linked with the ibm marketscan mortality file. Predictive performance was measured using c-statistics for binary outcomes (1-year and postoperative mortality, in-hospital complications) and root mean square prediction error (rmse) for continuous outcomes (1-year all-cause medical costs, index hospitalization costs, length of stay [los]), after adjusting for age and sex. C-statistics were compared by the method of delong and colleagues (1988); rmses, by resampling. C-statistics were generally high (≥ ~ 0.8) for mortality but lower for in-hospital complications (~0.6-0.7). Rmses for costs and hospitalization los were relatively large and comparable to standard deviations. Results were similar overall between the us and canadian adaptations, with relative differences typically <1%. This us-based coding adaptation and a previously published canadian adaptation resulted in similar predictive ability for all outcomes evaluated but may have different construct validity (not evaluated in our study). We recommend using adaptations specific to the country of data origin based on good research practice.",33580525

The aim of the present study was to investigate the consistency and simultaneity of safety related updates in product labeling in japan and the united states. New safety label changes that were made for new drugs approved concurrently both in japan and the united states in the recent 5 years were identified and reviewed for concordance and time lag analysis. Factors associated with the time lag were also investigated. Despite similar medical practices, population health and regulation in the countries, a low level of concordance (40/115, 34.8%) in the decision of labeling change was found in 31 new active substances. Only 3/40 (7.5%) of the concordant changes were made simultaneously. Labeling change orders issued by regulators and domestic postmarketing adverse event reports were associated with a significant difference in the timing of labeling change between the countries. We found a low level of concordance between regulators in the decision of labeling changes and the timeliness of the changes. The low concordance and time lag highlighted the need for further international collaboration between regulators and industry and greater transparency in the decision-making process for the label change.",33559352

Study time was divided into five periods demarcated by issuance of cms national coverage determination (ncd) (pre-ncd, pre-rems) and rems milestones (grace period, rems, post-rems). Study outcomes were monthly proportion of chemotherapy episodes (ctes) with concomitant esa administration, with post-cte esa administration, and with rbc transfusions. Of 1 778 855 beneficiaries treated with ct, 308742 received concomitant esa for cia. The proportion of ctes with concomitant and post-cte esa administration decreased pre-rems (9.0 percentage points [pp] and 3.5 pp, respectively). There were no significant post-rems changes in the proportion of ctes with concomitant (0.0 pp) and post-cte esa administration (0.1 pp). Fluctuation in rbc transfusions was <4 pp throughout the study period. Medicare beneficiaries showed a substantive decrease in esa administration after ncd, with minimal impact by the rems and its removal. Small changes in rbc transfusion over the study period were likely due to a national secular trend.",33534188

The objective of this study was to determine whether there was an increase in fall risk increasing drug prescribing and if this is concurrent with an increase in fall-related mortality in persons 65 years and older in the united states. The study is a serial cross-sectional analysis utilizing data from both the national vital statistics system (nvss) and the medical expenditure panel survey (meps) for years 1999-2017. Adults aged 65 years and older were evaluated for death due to falls from the nvss and for prescription fills of fall risk increasing drugs per the stopping elderly accidents, deaths, and injuries-rx (steadi-rx) fall checklist from the meps. The analysis included 374 972 fall-related mortalities and 7 858 177 122 fills of fall risk increasing drugs. 563 037 964 persons age 65 and older received at least one fall risk increasing drug.

We identify highly associated aes with gbs and develop prediction models for gbs using the us vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) reports following trivalent influenza vaccination (flu3). This study analyzed 80 059 reports from the us vaers between 1990 and 2017. Several aes were identified as highly associated with gbs and were used to develop the prediction model. Some common and mild aes that were suspected to be underreported when gbs occurred simultaneously were removed from the final model. The analyses were validated using european influenza vaccine aes data from eudravigilance. Of the 80 059 reports, 1185 (1.5%) were annotated as gbs related. Twenty-four aes were identified as having strong association with gbs. The full prediction model, using age, sex, and all 24 aes achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve (auc) of 85.4% (90% ci: [83.8%, 86.9%]). After excluding the nine (e.g., pruritus, rash, injection site pain) likely underreported aes, the final auc became 77.5% (90% ci: [75.5%, 79.6%]). Two hundred and one (0.25%) reports were predicted as of high risk of gbs (predicted probability >25%) and 84 actually developed gbs. The prediction performance demonstrated the potential of developing risk-prediction models utilizing the vaers cohort. Excluding the likely underreported aes sacrificed some prediction power but made the model more interpretable and feasible. The high absolute risk of even a small number of ae combinations suggests the promise of gbs prediction within the vaers dataset.",33533072

This study applied flexible ml (xgboost, distributed random forest [drf] and feedforward network) and conventional ml approaches (logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [lasso]) to 3400 dka cases and 11 780 controls nested in adults with type 1 diabetes identified from optum® de-identified electronic health record dataset (2007-2018). Area under the curve (auc), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were computed using fivefold cross validation, and their 95% confidence intervals (ci) were established using 1000 bootstrap samples. The importance of predictors was compared across these models. In the training set, xgboost and feedforward network yielded higher auc values (0.89 and 0.86, respectively) than logistic regression (0.83), lasso (0.83) and drf (0.81). However, the auc values were similar (0.82) among these approaches in the test set (95% ci range, 0.80-0.84). While the accuracy values >0.8 and the specificity values >0.9 for all models, the sensitivity values were only 0.4. The differences in these metrics across these models were minimal in the test set. All approaches selected some known risk factors for dka as the top 10 features. Xgboost and drf included more laboratory measurements or vital signs compared with conventional ml approaches, while feedforward network included more social demographics. In our empirical study, all ml approaches demonstrated similar performance, and identified overlapping, but different, top 10 predictors.

We denote this the ""bottleneck count"" (bnc). We describe how to translate the bnc into an achievable precision and provide empirical examples. First, we derive a theoretical prediction of the precision in a study where only the bnc determines precision. As an illustration, we calculated the expected precision of a null-effect study on retinoids and peptic ulcer bleeding, expressed as the upper/lower confidence limit ratio (ulclr). Finally, we reviewed 126 effect estimates from the literature, analyzing the relationship between the predicted and achieved precision. The log-log transformed ulclr was shown to be a simple linear function of log(bnc). The expected annual number of retinoid-users experiencing a peptic ulcer bleeding was 9.8, yielding an estimated ulclr for a 1-year study of 3.84. The literature review showed an inverse linear relationship between the logarithmic bnc and the log-log transformed ulclr, which was largely independent of study design, effect measure and category of bnc. Achieved precision deviated little from predictions but was usually lower than predicted, particularly with low bnc. The precision of a study can be predicted simply and with good accuracy from the bnc, which is useful for determining whether a study is worth pursuing or not.",33480043

Dispensation and query records from the texas pmp for opioid and benzodiazepine medications dispensed between october 1, 2016 and december 31, 2018 were linked using common patient identifiers. Autoregressive linear regression was used to assess trends in utilization. Hierarchical logistic models were specified to identify factors associated with provider and pharmacist query of opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions. Despite a significant increase in the total number of pharmacists (β = 169.85, p < 0.0001) and prescribers (β = 301.59, p < 0.0001) who used the pmp every month, the ratio of active to registered pharmacists (β = -0.0001, p = 0.75) and prescribers (β = -0.0015, p = 0.10) did not change. Pharmacists and prescribers were significantly more likely to query opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions of 14 days or more, and those issued to patients new to their practice. Pharmacists were most likely to query opioid prescriptions for oxycodone (aor = 4.51, 95%ci = 4.42-4.60) and prescribers were most likely to query prescriptions for buprenorphine (aor = 2.24, 95%ci = 2.15-2.35) compared to codeine. Changes in pmp utilization between october 2016 and december 2018 were driven by increasing registration, not increasing frequency of use among registered users. Use of the pmp is inconsistent and dependent upon patient characteristics thus limiting the utility of the pmp as a decision support tool. These results support the need for policy mandating pmp use in texas and provide a useful baseline and framework to evaluate the effectiveness of mandate implementation.",33458926

The number of real-world rr-lbcl patients was projected over time in a general population of 5, 15, and 25 million citizens using lymphoma registry data. For each scenario, we computed the power over time for detecting significant deviations in efficacy (1-year overall survival [1yos]) when comparing to historical controls (scholar-1 study; 1yos, 28%) and rr-lbcl patients treated with car-t cell therapy in a single-arm trial (zuma-1; 1yos, 59%) as well as deviations in selected adverse events (grade ≥3 aphasia) from the zuma-1 trial. We assumed a 10% absolute deviation in 1yos (efficacy) and a relative increase of 50% in grade ≥3 aphasia (safety). Assuming a general population of 5, 15, and 25 million, the accrual time needed to achieve 80% power for detecting a significant increase over the 1yos reported in scholar-1 was 9, 4, and 3 years, respectively, while 80% power for detecting a significant decrease in 1yos compared to zuma-1 required 10.5, 4.5, and 3 years of data accrual, respectively. However, corresponding estimates for aphasia were >20, 8, and 5 years, respectively. Projections of the statistical power for detecting important deviations in efficacy/safety from that reported in pivotal clinical trials(s) provide critical information about the expected performance of post-authorization monitoring programs.",33432654

Opioid dispensing was evaluated using claims from filled prescriptions. Two different definitions of chronic opioid use were employed: ≥90 days' supply and ≥180 days' supply of prescription opioids during pregnancy. Patient characteristics were assessed and variations in the prevalence of chronic opioid therapy were described by geographic region and over time. 1.50% of 975 169 medicaid-insured and 0.32% of 1 037 599 commercially insured beneficiaries filled opioid prescriptions for ≥90 days' supply; 0.78% (medicaid) and 0.17% (commercially insured) filled prescriptions for ≥180 days' supply. Prevalence approximately doubled in medicaid beneficiaries during the study period, while it remained relatively stable for commercial insurance beneficiaries. The most commonly prescribed opioid for chronic therapy was hydrocodone, followed by oxycodone and tramadol. Indications commonly associated with chronic use were back/neck pain, abdominal/pelvic pain, musculoskeletal pain and migraine/headache. Substantial regional variation was observed, with several states reporting a frequency of ≥90 days' supply in excess of 3% in medicaid-insured patients. Despite growing awareness of the risks associated with chronic opioid use and emphasis on improving opioid prescription patterns, prevalence of chronic use in pregnancy among publicly insured women nearly doubled from 2008-2014 and was 5-fold more common when compared to commercially insured women. Findings call for the development of guidelines on chronic pain management during pregnancy.",33428239

Quarterly time series analyses measuring hydroxyzine initiation, discontinuation, and switching to other antihistamines, benzodiazepines and antidepressants in denmark, england, scotland and the netherlands from 2009 to 2018. Data were analysed using interrupted time series regression. Hydroxyzine initiation in quarter one 2010 in denmark, scotland, england and the netherlands per 100 000 was: 23.5, 91.5, 35.9 and 34.4 respectively. Regulatory action was associated with a significant: immediate fall in hydroxyzine initiation per 100 000 in england (-12.05, 95%ci -18.47 to -5.63) and scotland (-19.01, 95%ci -26.99 to -11.02); change to a negative trend in hydroxyzine initiation per 100 000/quarter in england (-1.72, 95%ci -2.69 to -0.75) and scotland (-2.38, 95%ci -3.32 to -1.44). Regulatory action was associated with a significant: immediate rise in hydroxyzine discontinuation per 100 000 in england (3850, 95%ci 440-7240). No consistent changes were observed in the netherlands or denmark. Regulatory action was associated with no switching to other antihistamines, benzodiazepines or antidepressants following hydroxyzine discontinuation in any country. The 2015 ema regulatory action was associated with heterogeneous impact with reductions in hydroxyzine initiation varying by country.

Nevertheless, evidences on adverse events (aes) associated with andrographis paniculata are very limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate and to compare the ae incidence of oral monotherapy andrographis paniculata with others among patients with upper respiratory tract infection, noninfective diarrhea, and autoimmune disease. Systematic search was performed through six databases from inception until august 2018. Randomized controlled trial (rct), cohort, or intensive monitoring of aes was eligible for review if ae incidence was examined. The incidence of aes was, then, pooled across studies using meta-analysis. Ten rcts and 3 intensive monitoring studies were included. Incidence of serious aes was very rare with the pooled incidence (95% ci) from rcts of 0.02 per 1000 patients (0.0-0.5). However, the incidence of nonserious aes was considered very common with the pooled incidence (95% ci) from rcts of 102.6 per 1000 patients (10.7-256.1), and the pooled incidence (95% ci) from intensive monitoring of 34.2 per 1000 patients (0.0-229.6). The most common nonserious aes were related to gastrointestinal disorder, and skin and subcutaneous disorder system. Like other medicine, andrographis paniculata can cause some aes. However, it may be generally safe. Nevertheless, prospective patients who plan to use andrographis paniculata should be thoroughly advised and closely monitored for common aes. Due to the increasing use of andrographis paniculata worldwide, larger studies with adequate methodological quality are warranted to monitor the safety of such product.",33372366

The goal of this article is to provide clarity and guidance on issues related to confounding and provide motivation for using more flexible models for causal inference in pharmacoepidemiology. In this article we elucidate two important components of making valid inference from observational data: measuring the necessary set of variables at the design/data collection phase (measured confounding) and properly accounting for confounding at the modeling/analysis phase (accounted-for confounding). For the latter concept, we contrast parametric modeling approaches, which are susceptible to model misspecification bias, with data adaptive approaches. Both measuring and properly accounting for confounding is critical to obtaining valid causal inference from pharmacoepidemiology studies. Carefully thought out dags, based on subject matter knowledge, can help to better identify confounders and confounding. Even when confounding has been adequately measured, mis-specified models may lead to unaccounted for confounding and increasing the sample size often does not help. We recommend modern analytic techniques such as flexible data adaptive approaches that do not rely on strong parametric assumptions. Further, sensitivity analyses and other modern bounding approaches are recommended to account for the effects of unmeasured confounding. Confounding must be considered at both the design and analysis stages of a study. Dags and data adaptive approaches can help.",33372303

Patients' demographic and lifestyle factors, comorbidity profile, spirometry measurements and treatment changes were evaluated, as was the distribution of follow-up time and types of losses during follow-up. Characteristics were evaluated using descriptive statistics. A total of 322 991 patients from 1148 primary care practices in the united kingdom across two cprd primary care databases, cprd gold and cprd aurum, were potentially eligible to participate in a hypothetical trial using cprd, starting on 31 december 2017. Patients with copd in cprd gold and cprd aurum were comparable in terms of age (median age 70 vs. 68 years), gender (50% vs. 52% male), disease severity (e.g., 25% vs. 24% medical research council [mrc] dyspnoea score grades 3-5) and history of respiratory conditions (e.g., 43% vs. 38% asthma).

Our objectives were to validate diagnoses of ap and to identify an algorithm using additional data to enhance the identification of ap cases in different data sources. We randomly sampled 550 persons with an ap diagnosis from inpatient data or outpatient or emergency department diagnoses immediately preceding a hospitalization and 150 negative controls with a differential diagnosis (cholangitis or cholecystitis). We conducted an emr review to confirm cases of ap and used logistic regression to develop emr-based and claims-based algorithms to identify confirmed ap cases with variables typically available in electronic data sources. Algorithm performance was assessed using the c statistic, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. Of the 550 patients with an ap diagnosis, 467 (84.9%) were confirmed cases. An ap diagnosis alone had high sensitivity (98.9%), modest specificity (63.6%), and a c statistic of 0.813. An emr-based model using an ap diagnosis, body mass index ≥30 kg/m  , a serum lipase >3 times upper limit of normal and diabetes attained a c-statistic of 0.914. A claims-based model attained a c-statistic of 0.892 using an ap diagnosis and dichotomous variables for whether a serum lipase test and/or an abdominal ultrasound was performed.

Using premier research database (october 2007-september 2017), we identified adults who were hospitalized for inpatient surgical procedures (n = 6 068 133). For each month, we calculated proportion of patients admitted that month who were administered (1) opioids, (2) acetaminophen, (3) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsads), and (4) gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin) during the postoperative period, defined as inpatient postoperative days 1-7, unless discharged earlier. For patients administered opioids, we estimated total and average daily postoperative opioid dose in morphine milligram equivalents (mmes). Monthly measures were standardized to the distribution of surgeries and the length of postoperative stay within each surgery during the last year of available data. Overall, 90.8% of patients were administered opioids postoperatively; mean total postoperative dose was 304 mmes (median 130). Both the frequency and the amount of opioids administered remained stable over 2007-2017. Postoperative use of acetaminophen increased from mean standardized monthly prevalence of 78% in 2007-2008 to 85% in 2017, while the use of nsaids remained stable at a standardized mean of 37%. The use of gabapentinoids increased from below 10% in 2007-2008 to the mean standardized monthly prevalence of 23% in 2017. Despite growing awareness of risks associated with postoperative opioid use, we observed no change in postoperative utilization of opioids in us hospitals.

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study among ontario residents newly dispensed an opioid for pain between july 2013 and march 2016. The primary exposure was the average daily opioid dose dispensed at initiation (in milligram morphine equivalents; mme), with secondary exposures including the initial prescription's duration and formulation. The primary outcome was fatal or non-fatal opioid overdose. A secondary analysis studied continued opioid use for at least 1 year. Among the 2 021 371 individuals meeting our inclusion criteria, 1121 (0.56 per 1000 person-years) experienced an opioid overdose within 1 year and 64 013 (3.17%) continued treatment for at least 1 year. Higher initial daily dose, longer prescription duration, and receipt of a long-acting formulation at initiation were significantly associated with higher hazard of overdose. Compared to daily doses of 20 mme or lower, initial doses exceeding 200 mme daily were associated with a particularly high hazard of overdose (ahr 2.97, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.62 to 5.44).

The study is a cross-sectional study that was conducted using a purposive sampling technique. In the study, 150 respondents were administered questionnaires by one-on-one interviews, and results were presented as frequencies and proportions. A chi-square test was done to determine the association between independent categorical variables and the dependent variable. In the study, 91 (60.7%) of the women claimed they did malaria screening tests in the laboratory/clinic before treatment, while only half of them sought professional care for treatment after the screening test. Additionally, most of the participants claimed they practice self-medication with antimalarials for themselves (64, 42.7%), and their newborn children (34, 22.7%).

Of 573 infants with ≥2 diagnoses for a targeted bd, on adjudication, we classified 399 (69.6%) as probable cases, 31 (5.4%) as possible cases and 143 (25.0%) as not having the targeted bd. Ppvs for the final bd algorithms ranged from 0.76 (hypospadias) to 1.0 (gastroschisis). Among 212 857 births over 2 years following transition to icd-10-cm coding, prevalence for the full list of selected defects in the vsd was 1.8%. Algorithms can identify infants with selected bds using automated healthcare data with reasonable accuracy. Our updated algorithms can be used in observational studies of maternal vaccine safety and may be adapted for use in other surveillance systems.",33219586

Cross-sectional survey was conducted over 2-month period in 2016 among physicians who prescribed valproate in france, germany, the united kingdom, spain and sweden. The web-based questionnaire included five endpoints to evaluate physicians' knowledge on (a) prescribing valproate only for epilepsy and bipolar disorder in women if other treatments were ineffective or not tolerated; (b) ensuring supervision by experienced physicians while treating these conditions; (c) considering alternative treatments for women planning pregnancy, regular review of treatment needs and re-assessing the benefit-risk balance in women and girls reaching puberty; (d) informing patients about the risks of taking valproate during pregnancy and (e) advising women on effective contraception during their treatment. Among 1153 physicians, 95.5% responded prescribing valproate for epilepsy and bipolar disorder in women only if other treatments are ineffective/not tolerated; 66.5% supervised while treatment; 76.6% considered alternative treatments for women planning pregnancy; 92.1% informed patients about the risks of taking valproate during pregnancy and 94.4% advised patients on the use of effective contraception during its treatment. Overall, 25.8% physicians recalled receiving both educational material (em) and dear healthcare professional communication (dhpc). All endpoint rates were higher for physicians who acknowledged receipt of both dhpc and em compared to physicians who did not receive them. Although results varied across geography and physician speciality, majority of physicians had good knowledge about the indication and safety aspects of prescribing and using valproate.",33216434

The main outcome was the change (%) in reporting of adrs with step change as the a priori impact model. Further time series analysis was performed using joinpoint regression. The analysis included 11 active substances. No significant immediate (step change) increase of reporting was identified for any product at time of addition to am list. We identified a significant gradual increase of adr reporting after addition to am list (slope change) for two out of five new products-boceprevir (10% per month, 95% confidence interval (ci) 3%-18%) and denosumab-xgeva (13% per month, 95% ci 4%-22%). No change was identified for prolia, another denosumab-containing product not subject to am. No significant increase was identified for any product included in the am list due to the requirement to conduct a pass. Conversely, a gradual decrease in reporting was identified for natalizumab (-5% per month; 95% ci -10% to -1%), rivaroxaban (-5%; -8 to -3%), and varenicline (-16%; -21 to -10%). The results were corroborated by the joinpoint analyses, which yielded similar results.

A dmc model was created to monitor data from an observational, retrospective, post-authorization safety study investigating risk of medullary thyroid cancer in patients treated with long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (la glp-1ras) (nct01511393). Sponsors reviewed regulatory guidelines, best practice and sponsors' standard operation procedures on dmcs. Discussions were held within the four-member consortium, assessing applicability to observational, retrospective, real-world studies. A dmc charter was drafted based on a sponsor-proposed, adapted dmc model. Thereafter, a kick-off meeting between sponsors and dmc members was held to receive dmc input and finalize the charter. Due to this study's observational, retrospective nature, assuring participant safety - central for traditional explanatory clinical trial models - was not applicable to our dmc model. The overall strategy and key indication for our real-world model included preserving study integrity and credibility. Therefore, dmc member independence and their contribution of expert knowledge were essential. To ensure between-sponsor data confidentiality, all study committees/corporations and sponsors, besides the dmc, received blinded data only (adapted to refer to data blinding that revealed the specific marketed la glp-1ra/sponsor). Communication and blinding/unblinding of these data were facilitated by the contract research organization, which also provided crucial operational oversight.

This led to a restriction of their use in the early 2010s. The main objective was to analyse the evolution of antiemetic prescription rate in french general practise between 2006 and 2016. The secondary objectives were to highlight prescription transfers for metopimazine and to quantify the impact on health expenditures. All patients from a representative sample of a national administrative claims database, the french national health insurance database, were included between 2006 and 2016. Trends in annual anti-emetic prescription rates by general practitioners were analysed using logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender and the existence of cancer. The cost of theses changing prescription habits was quantified via médic'am, a public drug expenditure database. Around 669 020 individuals were included with a mean 8-year follow-up; 48 634 patients received an anti-emetic at least once between 2006 and 2016. Prescription rates for all antiemetics decreased significantly from 2.1% to 0.4%, especially for metoclopramide from 0.5% to 0.1%, for domperidone from 1.5% to 0.1% and for metopimazine from 0.4% to 0.2%, which is not in favour of prescription transfers. Expenses fell from 30 million euros in 2006 to 10 million in 2016. Decreases in anti-emetic prescription rates and public health expenditures preceded the publication of official recommendations to reduce the use of metoclopramide and domperidone, without prescription transfers for metopimazine.",33156565

We therefore reviewed the potential utility of rwe in the cycle of medicinal product benefit-risk (br) assessment, communication/risk minimization and evaluation (""brace""). A convenience sample of illustrative studies was drawn from the published literature and examined. Specifically, we examined the purpose for using rwe, the type of rwe used, its novelty and how it might be integrated with other data and activities of the brace cycle, and how it contributed to regulatory decision-making. Eight studies were selected with each illustrating a different activity in the brace cycle ranging from br assessment in the preapproval setting, post-approval assessment of safety or effectiveness, communicating br information to patients and healthcare professionals, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk minimization initiatives to support a positive br balance. Rwe has an important role in informing regulatory decision-making regarding the br management of medicines. With increasing digitalization, facilitating data collection and stakeholder engagement in health, this role is only expected to expand in the future. To reach the full potential of rwe, both regulators and sponsors will need to be familiar with a range of existing and emerging methods for generating and analyzing such evidence appropriately and achieve convergence regarding how different types of rwe can best be used to inform br management and decision-making.",33146901

Quetiapine is contraindicated for patients with diabetes in japan because there have been several case reports of diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) in patients receiving long-term, high-dose quetiapine. However, because safety of short-term, low-dose quetiapine remains controversial, it is prescribed for patients with diabetes in real-world clinical practice. The present study aimed to compare in-hospital mortality and morbidity between short-term, low-dose quetiapine and risperidone in postoperative patients with diabetes. We used a national inpatient database in japan to perform a retrospective cohort study. We identified hospitalized patients with diabetes who underwent scheduled elective surgery and received oral quetiapine 200 mg/d or less or oral risperidone 4 mg/d or less within 7 days of surgery between july 2010 and march 2018. We performed one-to-one propensity score-matched analyses to compare outcomes between patients with quetiapine and risperidone. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was infectious complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, and sepsis). Propensity score matching created 665 pairs of patients who received quetiapine or risperidone. The primary outcome was observed in 19 (2.9%) of the quetiapine group and 11 (1.7%) of the risperidone group (relative risk, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.68; p = .14).

We aim to define, using real world data (rwd), a reproducible procedure that allows identification of car-t target population for dlbcl. Through the linking of electronic healthcare datasets (ehd), we identified patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl), resident in lazio region (2010-2015), aged ≥20 years. Dlbcl patients were followed using pathological anatomy (pa) reports, up to 3 years. To be defined as relapsed after two treatment lines, patients must have had new chemotherapy and/or nhl hospitalization after asct or at the end of the second chemotherapy. The incident rate of second relapse (r2-rate) was extended to the population without pa reports. Nhl incident patients were 7384, 68% presented a pa report and, 29% of these had dlbcl codes. Patients who relapsed after two treatment lines were 47 (39%) in the subgroup of patients who received asct and 138 (41%) in that with second chemotherapy treatment. Patients in the two subgroups were very different in terms of age and comorbidity. The annual incident number of dlbcl was estimated to be 329 which multiplied by r2-rate (13.7%) gives 45 patients per year eligible for car-t. This study shows how rwd allows the identification of a target population with new advanced therapies. This approach is rigorous, transparent and verifiable over time.",33108004

Positive and negative drug controls were used to compare 196 self-controlled case series (sccs), case-control (cc), and case-population (cp) design variants, using area under the receiver operating curve (auc), mean square error (mse) and coverage probability. Parameters that had major impacts on results were identified through logistic regression. Using a specific ali definition, aucs ranged from 0.78 to 0.94, 0.64 to 0.92 and 0.48 to 0.85, for sccs, cc and cp, respectively. Mse ranged from 0.12 to 0.40, 0.22 to 0.39 and 1.03 to 5.29, respectively. Variants adjusting for multiple drug use had higher coverage probabilities.

The monzino 80-plus is an ongoing, prospective, door-to-door population-based study started in 2002 among all residents 80 years or older in eight municipalities of varese province, italy. To establish the relation between cognitive impairment and the anticholinergic drug burden we recorded the acb score for each patient at baseline. The relations between acb score and dementia or mmse scores were also examined after exclusion of patients taking any antipsychotic. A sample of 2140 elderly people was eligible for analysis. A significant dose-effect relationship was observed between total acb score and diagnosis of dementia in univariate and multivariate models. Patients in acb class ≥4 had about 4.5 times the risk of diagnosis of dementia. A relation was also found between higher acb scores and lower mmse scores; patients who scored 4 or more had a mean of 6.4 points lower than those not taking anticholinergic drugs. The dose-effect relationship between acb score and diagnosis of dementia was not maintained after exclusion of patients using antipsychotics, while the association between higher acb scores and lower mmse scores was still present, with patients in acb class ≥4 having a mean score about 4.4 lower. There are clear relations between anticholinergic load and reduced cognitive performance, while the association with dementia remains uncertain. For primary care and geriatric clinicians, an acb score ≥ 4 can be considered the cut-off to identify high-risk populations who may benefit from the evaluation of anticholinergic burden with the acb scale.",33098318

We evaluated antibiotic utilization defined by days of therapy/1000 patient days (dot/1000 pd) in various community hospitals across the united states. Community hospitals within the cardinal health drug cost opportunity analytics database were evaluated for the availability of dot/1000 pd data between 2012 to 2016 for overall and specific antibiotic use and the following classes: narrow-spectrum β-lactams (ampicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, cefazolin, and cephalexin), non-carbapenem antipseudomonal β-lactams (piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and cefepime), carbapenems, anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus agents (vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline), and fluoroquinolones. Antibiotic utilization and change in utilization during the study period was calculated using linear regression (β coefficient). Eighteen hospitals had antibiotic utilization data available. Hospitals were primarily urban (72%) with an average of 209 total beds and 22 intensive care unit beds. Mean number of pharmacists in these hospitals was nine with a mean pharmacist: bed ratio of 0.05. While all hospitals had antimicrobial stewardship programs established during the study period, only 78% and 22% had infectious diseases (id) physician and id pharmacist on staff, respectively. A decrease in antipseudomonal β-lactams (excluding carbapenems) and fluoroquinolones was observed (β coefficients = -1.2 and -2.6, respectively), all other antibiotic classes had increased utilization. Overall antibiotic utilization increased over 5 years. The increase in narrow-spectrum β-lactams utilization along with the reduction in the use of antipseudomonal β-lactams and fluoroquinolones indicate appropriate antimicrobial stewardship. Institutional antibiotic utilization should be evaluated for appropriateness to limit the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics in an effort to reduce resistance development.",33094502

Additionally, the validity of cardiovascular risk factors that could act as confounders in studies on those endpoints has not been thoroughly assessed in the united kingdom clinical practice research datalink's (cprd's) gold database. We explored the validity of algorithms to identify cardiovascular outcomes and risk factors and evaluated different outcome-identification strategies using these algorithms for estimation of adjusted incidence rate ratios (irrs). First, we identified ami, stroke, smoking, obesity, and menopausal status in a cohort treated for overactive bladder by applying computerized algorithms to primary care medical records (2004-2012). We validated these cardiovascular outcomes and risk factors with physician questionnaires (gold standard for this analysis). Second, we estimated irrs for ami and stroke using algorithm-identified and questionnaire-confirmed cases, comparing these with irrs from cases identified through linkage with hospitalization/mortality data (best estimate). For ami, the algorithm's positive predictive value (ppv) was >90%. Initial algorithms for stroke performed less well because of inclusion of codes for prevalent stroke; algorithm refinement increased ppv to 80% but decreased sensitivity by 20%. Algorithms for smoking and obesity were considered valid. Irrs based on questionnaire-confirmed cases only were closer to irrs estimated from hospitalization/mortality data than irrs from algorithm-identified cases. Ami, stroke, smoking, obesity, and postmenopausal status can be accurately identified in cprd. Physician questionnaire-validated ami and stroke cases yield irrs closest to the best estimate.",33091194

Although treatment is recommended for almost all persons infected with hcv, clinical and psychosocial factors may affect treatment initiation. We conducted an observational cohort study of kaiser permanente mid-atlantic states members with prevalent or incident hcv infection identified from november 2013 through may 2016 to identify predictors of daa initiation. We used cox regression with time-dependent covariates to compare time to treatment by clinical, demographic and societal factors. Of 2962 patients eligible for daa therapy, 33% (n = 980) initiated treatment over the study period. The majority of patients (97%) were persistent with therapy and most (95%) tested for sustained virologic response (svr) achieved cure. We found no effect of race, insurance type or fibrosis stage on treatment initiation. We observed that patients aged 41-60 years (ahr: 2.014, 95% ci: 1.12, 3.60) and 61-80 years (ahr: 2.08, 95% ci: 1.15-3.75) had higher treatment rates compared to younger patients. Incident cases were more likely to be treated than prevalent cases (ahr: 3.05, 95% ci: 2.40-3.89). Patients with a history of substance use disorder (sud) were less likely (ahr: 0.805, 95% ci: 0.680, 0.953) to be treated. In the first 3 years of daa availability, one-third of patients with hcv initiated therapy, and almost all were persistent and achieved cure. While curative, daas remain highly priced. Triaging for non-clinical reasons or perceptions about patients will stall our ability to eradicate hcv.",33090666

We examined the agreement of these diagnoses with patients' prior medical histories. We identified medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in 2011 to 2015 for total hip arthroplasty (tha), total knee arthroplasty (tka), acute myocardial infarction (ami), or sepsis. We compared diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) or ankylosing spondylitis (as) at the index hospitalization to diagnoses over prior inpatient and outpatient claims. To assess the impact of potential misclassification, we compared hospital outcomes using the alternative methods of detecting beneficiaries with arthritis. Analyses were repeated using medicaid data. Among 506 781 medicare beneficiaries with tha, 18282 had ra and 571 had as at the arthroplasty hospitalization, while 13 212 had ra and 1519 had as based on claims history. Diagnoses at the hospitalization were highly specific (0.98-0.99), but sensitivities (0.65 for ra; 0.31 for as) and positive predictive values (ppv) (0.47 for ra; 0.83 for as) were lower. For tka, ami, and sepsis, specificities were 0.97 to 0.99, sensitivities 0.60 to 0.66 for ra and 0.18 to 0.22 for as, and ppvs 0.43 to 0.47 for ra and 0.73 to 0.77 for as.

Data on allopurinol adr reports (2000-2018) were extracted from the malaysian adr database. We identified rmms implemented between 2000 and 2018 from the minutes of relevant meetings and the national pharmacovigilance newsletter. We obtained allopurinol utilization data (2004-2018) from the pharmaceutical services programme. To determine the impact of rmms on adr reporting, we considered adr reports received within 1 year of rmm implementation. We used the pearson χ  test to examine the relation between the implementation of rmms and allopurinol adr reports. The 16 rmms for allopurinol-related scars implemented in malaysia involved nine risk communications, four prescriber or patient educational material, and three health system innovations. Allopurinol utilization decreased by 21.5% from 2004 to 2018. Adr reporting rates for all drugs (n = 144 507) and allopurinol (n = 1747) increased. Adr reports involving off-label use decreased by 6% from 2011. Scars cases remained between 20% and 50%.

In particular, the time of the therapeutic decision is difficult to define when the controls are not treated. This retrospective observational study was based on a series of patients from the ms expert center in rennes, france. We used a time-dependent propensity score defined as the linear predictor of a cox model estimating the hazard of being treated at each time from ms onset. The matching procedure resulted in two groups: patients matched as treated and as not yet treated. The restricted mean times (rmst) to reach a moderate level of disability or worsening of the disability were compared between the two groups in an intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 2383 patients included in the study, 556 were matched as treated. The matching procedure provided a good balance of both the time-fixed and the time-dependent covariates. A slight difference was observed for the time to reach a moderate level of disability, in favor of the ""not yet treated"" group (difference in the rmst: -0.62 [-0.91; -0.33]) while no difference was found in terms of worsening of the disability (-0.03 [-0.24; 0.33]).

A case/non-case method was used to determine adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine as the primary suspect drug between january 1, 2004, and december 31, 2019, for older adults (≥65 years). Adverse events are preferred terms (pts) defined in meddra. We used frequentist approaches, including the reporting odds ratio (ror) and the proportional reporting ratio (prr) to measure disproportionality. We used bayesian approaches to derive information component (ic) value and empirical bayesian geometric mean (ebgm) score. Signals were defined as the number of reports > 3 and the lower limit of 95% confidence intervals (ci) of ror ≥ 2, prr ≥ 2, ic > 0, ebgm > 1. We identified 334 adverse cardiac events comprising 71 different meddra pts from 2004 to 2019 for hydroxychloroquine in older adults. Strong disproportionality signals were noted for ""restrictive cardiomyopathy"" (ror = 272.43 (138.09-537.47); ebgm = 149.78 (77.34-264.67), ""right ventricular hypertrophy"" (219.49 (85.32-564.70); 102.74 (39.67-222.81), ""cardiac septal hypertrophy"" (226.77 (78.65-653.80); 93.82 (32.19-219.81), ""myocardial fibrosis"" (57.29 (21.06-155.85); 42.99 (14.74-100.75), and ""cardiotoxicity"" (43.90 (26.66-72.27); 40.28 (24.02-63.72). The risk of cardiomyopathy and myocardial disorders is high following exposure to hydroxychloroquine in older adults.

The study was aimed at investigating direct healthcare costs of ckd patients treated with esas and the potential savings achievable by increasing the use of biosimilars and preventing inappropriate esa use. A multi-center, cohort study was conducted using claims databases of five large italian geographic areas. Yearly mean direct healthcare costs per patient were estimated, stratifying by ckd stage. The total yearly cost and potential savings related to esa use were estimated: (a) considering 25/50/75% of originator esa substitution with biosimilars; (b) eliminating inappropriate esa dispensing. During the study period, the esa-related yearly mean cost represented 17% of total yearly costs in stage i-iii, decreasing to 13% in stage iv-v and 6% in dialysis. Among originator users, assuming a 25% of biosimilar uptake, the annual cost-savings of esa treatment would represent 10.5% of total esa costs in ckd stage i-v and 7.7% in dialysis. Among incident esa users for which hemoglobin levels were available, 9% started inappropriately esa treatment, increasing to 62.0% during the first year of maintenance therapy. Hypothesizing prevention of the first inappropriate esa dispensing, the total yearly cost-savings would amount to €35 772, increasing to €167 641 eliminating the inappropriate dispensing during maintenance therapy. Higher use of lowest cost esa, prevention of inappropriate esa use as well as other strategies aimed at slowing down the progressive renal impairment are essential for minimizing clinical and economic burden of ckd.",33067914

Modest effects of a commonly used drug could result in adverse events for large numbers of pregnant women. Therefore, our objective was to compare the risk of stillbirth, preterm birth, gestational hypertensive disorders, small for gestational age, and differences in birth weight between women prescribed ondansetron and women prescribed alternative antiemetics in early pregnancy. A cohort of pregnant women receiving a prescription for ondansetron or comparator antiemetics (metoclopramide or promethazine) during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was identified using electronic health record data from a health care system in north carolina, usa. Confounding by multiple covariates was controlled using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights. Weighted hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) accounted for competing events. We identified 2677 eligible pregnancies with antiemetic orders, 66% for ondansetron. The small number of stillbirths (n = 15) resulted in an imprecise estimate of the association with ondansetron (hr = 1.60; 95%ci 0.51, 4.97). No association was observed for preterm birth (hr = 0.90; 95%ci 0.67, 1.20) or gestational hypertensive disorders (hr = 0.87; 95%ci 0.68, 1.12). We observed an association with small for gestational age (hr = 1.37; 95%ci 0.98, 1.90), however mean birth weight among term births was similar between groups. Our results do not suggest that ondansetron increases the risk of preterm birth or gestational hypertensive disorders. The weak association observed between ondansetron use and small for gestational age warrants further investigation.",33067868

A semi-automated pre-selection was used to make a crude identification of possible harms of which four samples were selected. These were independently assessed with respect to causality and potential preventability by a physician and pharmacist. The results were stratified by age into 18-64 years and 65 years and older. For these groups the net prevalences and incidence rates of harms and potentially preventable harms were calculated for the years 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013.

We included people aged ≥65 years diagnosed with cancer in nsw, australia in 2005 to 2015. We examined patterns of opioid use in the 12 months after cancer diagnosis and used cause-specific hazards models to examine factors associated with opioid use. Of 13 527 people diagnosed with cancer, 51% were dispensed opioids after their diagnosis. We observed the highest proportions of use in people diagnosed with pancreas, liver, or lung cancers. Opioid use was associated with female sex, younger age, more advanced degree of cancer spread, opioid use before cancer diagnosis, and multimorbidity. Forty-four percentages of all people dispensed opioids had a history of opioid use in the 12 months before their cancer diagnosis; these people had higher median number of different opioids and opioid dispensings, and a shorter time to first opioid dispensing than opioid-naive people. Our study suggests that many older cancer patients were dispensed opioids before their cancer diagnosis. Previously opioid-treated people had more intense opioid use patterns after diagnosis than opioid-naïve people. Acknowledging the history of opioid use is important as it may complicate pain treatment in clinical practice.",33047458

We identified women 15 to 50 years with a livebirth from january 2001 through march 2018 in sentinel database. We assessed the prevalence of pde5 inhibitor use prior to and during pregnancy by trimester, identified potential on- and off-label indications using predefined diagnosis codes recorded within 90 days before the estimated last menstrual period through delivery. Separately, we used data from iqvia's national prescription audit and total patient tracker to estimate the dispensed prescriptions for pde5 inhibitors and the number of patients with pde5 inhibitor prescriptions. We identified approximately 3.3 million pregnancies during 2001 to 2018, 96 of which had pde5 inhibitor use during pregnancy. Prevalence of pde5 inhibitor use was 2.61, 0.62, and 0.62 per 100, 000 live-born pregnancies during the first, second, or third trimesters, respectively. Among women exposed to a pde5 inhibitor from 90 days before conception to the end of pregnancy, 25.0%, 31.1%, and 15.5% had a diagnosis code for fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In iqvia data, an estimated 223, 000 prescriptions from july 2015 through june 2018 and 58, 000 women received prescriptions for pde5 inhibitors in 2017, of whom approximately 15, 000 (26%) were aged 15 to 50 years. We found a low prevalence of pde5 inhibitor use in pregnant and reproductive-age women. Given the very low prevalence of use and the inconsistency of neonatal mortality data across strider centers, the risk to public health is low at present.",33020970

Our objective was to test this hypothesis by comparing rates of new onset depression among anticholinergic medication users and those who were prescribed an alternative class of overactive bladder medication. We used administrative data records from the province of ontario, canada and a matched cohort design. We matched patients who were newly prescribed an oral anticholinergic to those prescribed a beta-3 agonist medication in a 2:1 ratio which included a propensity score that incorportated 75 baseline characteristics. The primary outcome of depression was measured using a validated definition, and the at-risk period for our outcome of interest was between the initial date the prescription was filled, and up to 3 months after the end of continuous usage of that medication. Hazard ratios (hrs) were estimated using cox proportional hazards regression. We matched 23 622 beta-3 agonist users (mirabegron) to 47 324 anticholinergic users (most commonly tolterodine, oxybutynin, and solifenacin). The rate of depression was similar among beta-3 agonist users (11.2 per 1000 patient-years) and anticholinergic users (11.9 per 1000 patient-years). In our primary analysis, the risk of depression among anticholinergic users was not significantly different compared to beta-3 agonist users (hr 1.08 [95% ci 0.92-1.28, p = .35]). Contrary to a previous report, overactive bladder anticholinergic medications do not appear to be associated with new onset depression.",33015899

We utilize a hybrid approach, combining clinical trial and real-world data, to estimate the comparative effectiveness of two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for colon cancer. We identified patients aged 66 and older enrolled in the multicenter international study of oxaliplatin/5fu-lv in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. Similar patients were identified in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer)-medicare database, initiating adjuvant chemotherapy with either 5-fluorouracil (5fu) alone or in combination with oxaliplatin (folfox). We used logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of trial enrollment as a function of age, sex, and substage. Using inverse odds of sampling weights (iosw), we compared 5-year mortality in patients randomized to folfox vs 5fu using weighted cox proportional hazards regression, the nelson-aalen estimator for cumulative hazards, and bootstrapping for 95% confidence intervals (cis). There were 690 trial participants and 3834 seer-medicare patients. The seer-medicare population was older and had a higher proportion of stage iiib and iiic patients than the trial. After controlling for differences between populations, the iosw 5-year hr was 1.21 (0.89, 1.65), slightly farther from the null than the trial estimate (hr = 1.14, 95%ci: 0.87, 1.49). This study supports mounting evidence of little to no incremental reduction in 5-year mortality for folfox vs 5fu in older adults with stage ii-iii colon cancer, emphasizing the importance of combining clinical trial and real-world data to support such conclusions.",33015888

Patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer in surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) (gold standard) were linked with medicare claims. A 5% medicare ""other cancer"" sample and noncancer sample served as controls. A split-sample validation approach was used. Rules-based, regression, and machine learning models for developing algorithms were explored. Algorithms were developed in the model building subset. Rules-based algorithms and those with the highest f scores were evaluated in the validation subset. F scores were compared for 1000 bootstrap samples. Misclassification was evaluated by calculating the odds of selection by the algorithm among true positives and true negatives. A practical single-score algorithm derived from a logistic regression model had sensitivity = 78.22% and ppv = 78.50% (f score: 78.36). The algorithm was most likely to misclassify older patients (ages ≥80 years) or with missing data in the seer registry, shorter follow-up time in medicare (<3 months), insurance through veterans affairs, >1 cancer in seer, or certain charlson comorbidities (dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, or myocardial infarction).

We identified a cohort of community dwelling medicare beneficiaries with linked ehr (aged 65+, continuously enrolled with a large health system/until death between 2012 and 2014, n = 20 945) and drew a stratified ehr review sample (n = 1534). An expert reviewed all records to adjudicate anticonvulsant use, years of use, indication for use, and evidence of ades attributable to anticonvulsant initiation. After excluding patients with insufficient ehr data (n = 37; 2%), we reconstructed the cohort using inverse probability weights to resemble the original cohort of eligible beneficiaries (n = 20 380). Among incident users of a single anticonvulsant, we estimated the rate of ades and described the type and severity of ades. Overall, 12% (n = 2469) of eligible beneficiaries used at least one anticonvulsant in the 2012 to 2014 period (4% [n = 757] incident users, 8% [n = 1712] prevalent users).

Among 36 701 individuals with a first prescription for rivaroxaban/warfarin between 2012 and 2015, we performed a two-step vte case identification process followed by a two-step case validation process involving manual review of patient records. A valid case required a coded entry for vte at some point after their first rivaroxaban/warfarin prescription with evidence of referral/hospitalization either as a coded entry or entered as free text. Positive predictive values (ppvs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated using validated cases as the gold standard. Incidence rates were calculated per 1000 person-years with 95% cis. We identified 2166 patients with a coded entry of vte after their initial rivaroxaban/warfarin prescription; incidence rate of 45.31 per 1000 person-years (95% ci: 43.49-47.22). After manual review of patient records including the free text, there were 712 incident vte cases; incidence rate of 14.90 per 1000 person-years (95% ci: 13.85-16.02). The ppv for coded entries of vte alone was 32.9%, and the ppv for coded entries of vte with a coded entry of referral/hospitalization was 39.8%; this increased to 69.6% after manual review of coded clinical entries in patient records.

Identifying diabetes in emr is complicated by the variety of accepted diagnostic criteria, some of which can be confounded by conditions such as hiv infection. We compared emr-based criteria for estimating diabetes prevalence and incidence in the veterans health administration (vha), overall and by hiv status, against physician chart review and adjudication. We used laboratory values (serum glucose and hemoglobin a1c% [hba1c]), icd-9 codes, and medication records from the united states veterans aging cohort study biomarker cohort to identify veterans with any indication of diabetes in the emr for subsequent physician adjudication. Sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv, and kappa statistics were used to evaluate agreement of emr-based diabetes diagnoses with chart review adjudicated diagnoses. Emr entries were reviewed for 1546 persons with hiv (pwh) and 843 hiv-negative participants through 2015. Agreement was at least moderate overall (kappa ≥ 0.42) for all pre-specified measures and among pwh vs hiv-negative, and african-american vs white sub-groups.

Previous studies have reported no increase in risk of miscarriage but relied on methods that failed to account for gestational weeks at risk and non-user comparators, which may increase the potential for unmeasured confounding. Our objective was to estimate the risk of miscarriage among women prescribed ondansetron vs alternative antiemetics during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. A pregnancy cohort was created using electronic health record data from a health care system in north carolina. Women were classified as exposed to either ondansetron or comparator antiemetics (metoclopramide or promethazine) based on the first antiemetic prescription received in the first 20 weeks of gestation. Cumulative incidence of miscarriage at 20 weeks was estimated in each antiemetic group. Hazard ratios (hr) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals and measured confounding was controlled using inverse probability of treatment weights. Sensitivity analyses assessed the potential impact of exposure misclassification, latency period, and selection bias. We identified 2620 eligible pregnancies with antiemetic orders; 65% had a first ondansetron order and 35% had a first comparator antiemetic order. In total, 95 women had a miscarriage. After adjustment, there was no difference in risk of miscarriage (hr 1.21, 95% ci 0.77, 1.90). Results from the per-protocol and other sensitivity analyses were similar to the main analysis.

The drug burden index (dbi), a pharmacological screening tool, measures these properties across drug classes, and higher dbi drug exposure (dbi > 1) has been associated with certain physical function-related adverse events. Our aim was to quantify mean daily dbi drug exposure among older adults in the united states (us). We screened medications for dbi properties and operationalized the dbi for us medicare claims. We then conducted a retrospective cohort study of a 20% random, nationwide sample of 4 137 384 fee-for-service medicare beneficiaries aged 66+ years (134 757 039 person-months) from january 2013 to december 2016. We measured the monthly distribution based on mean daily dbi, categorized as (a) >0 vs 0 (any use) and (b) 0, 0 < dbi ≤ 1, 1 < dbi ≤ 2, and dbi > 2, and examined temporal trends. We described patient-level factors (eg, demographics, healthcare use) associated with high (>2) vs low (0 < dbi≤1) dbi drug exposure. The distribution of the mean daily dbi, aggregated at the month-level, was: 58.1% dbi = 0, 29.0% 0 < dbi≤1, 9.3% 1 < dbi≤2, and 3.7% dbi > 2. Predictors of high monthly dbi drug exposure (dbi > 2) included certain indicators of increased healthcare use (eg, high number of drug claims), white race, younger age, frailty, and a psychosis diagnosis code. The predictors of high dbi drug exposure can inform discussions between patients and providers about medication appropriateness and potential de-prescribing.

We assessed whether diagnosis codes for type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and iron deficiency or unspecified anemia were accompanied by supporting codes including lab results and treatments (correctness) and whether lab results, treatments, or other codes indicate a missing diagnosis record (completeness). Among 37 502 patients in cprd aurum, correctness of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and anemia diagnoses was high (99%, 93%, and 97%, respectively). Completeness was only high for type 2 diabetes (94%-98%); completeness for hypercholesterolemia and anemia diagnoses was modest even when the presence of treatments and lab results indicated the conditions were likely present (51%-59% and 58%-70%, respectively). Our findings indicate that for studies of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and iron deficiency or unspecified anemia, the diagnosis code is likely to be correct where present. However, a significant proportion of cases of hyperlipidemia or anemia will be missed if only diagnosis codes are used to select patients with these conditions.

We aimed to assess the validity of 13 different algorithms based on danish nationwide prescription and/or hospital data to identify adults with allergic rhinitis. Our primary gold standard of allergic rhinitis was a positive serum specific ige (≥0.35) and self-reported nasal symptoms retrieved from two general health examination studies conducted in danish adults (18-69 years) during 2006 to 2008 (n = 3416) and 2012 to 2015 (n = 7237).

We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), negative predictive value, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% ci) for each register-based algorithm in the two time periods. Sensitivity (≤0.40) was low for all algorithms irrespective of definition of allergic rhinitis (gold standard) or time period.

We divided the study period into a pre- and post-dur period. The monthly percentage of patients or prescriptions with at least one pim in the dur or defined by the beers criteria was calculated using national health insurance data. We evaluated the effect of the dur on the prevalence of pim use in older adults using an interrupted time series with segmented regression analysis. The prevalence of older adults prescribed pims in the dur decreased by 0.49% (95% confidence interval (ci) [-0.60, -0.37]) based on patient-based measures and, by 0.41% (95% ci [-0.58, -0.23]) based on prescription-based measure, immediately after dur implementation. However, there were no statistically significant changes in trend. Further, the prevalence of pims based on the beers criteria had no statistically significant changes in terms of either level or trend. After 12 months of dur, there was a reduction of 11.5% (95% ci [2.6 20.4]) relative to the pims in beers.

We present examples of external control groups that demonstrate some of the issues that arise and make recommendations to address them through careful assessment of the data source fitness for use, design, and analysis steps. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and context that produce a trial population may result in trial patients with different clinical characteristics than are present in an external comparison group. If these differences affect the risk of outcomes, then a comparison of outcome occurrence will be confounded. Further, patients who continue into lte may differ from those initially entering the trial due to treatment effects. Application of appropriate methods is needed to make valid inferences when such treatment or selection effects are present. Outcome measures in a trial may be ascertained and defined differently from what can be obtained in an external comparison group. Differences in sensitivity and specificity for identification or measurement of study outcomes leads to information bias that can also invalidate inferences. This review concentrates on threats to the valid use of external control groups both in the scenarios of single arm trials and lte of randomized controlled trials, along with methodological approaches to mitigate them.",32964514

We aimed to assess trends in hba  thresholds at initiation of a first hypoglycemic agent(s) in t2d patients and the influence of age and frailty on these trends. The groningen initiative to analyze type 2 diabetes treatment (giantt) database was used, which includes primary care t2d patients from the north of the netherlands. Patients initiating a first non-insulin hypoglycemic agent(s) between 2008 and 2014 with an hba  measurement within 120 days before initiation were included. The influence of calendar year, age, or frailty and the interaction between calendar year and age or frailty were assessed using multilevel regression analyses adjusted for confounders. We included 4588 patients. The mean hba  threshold at treatment initiation was 7.4% up to 2010, decreasing to 7.1% in 2011 and increasing to 7.4% in 2014. This quadratic change over the years was significant (p < 0.001). Patients aged 60 to 79 initiated treatments at lower hba  and patients of different frailty at similar hba  levels. The interaction between year and age or frailty was not significant (p > 0.05). Hba  thresholds at initiation of a first hypoglycemic agent(s) changed significantly over time, showing a decrease after 2010 and an increase after 2012. The hba  threshold at initiation was not influenced by age or frailty, which is in contrast with recommendations for more personalized treatment.",32955156

We hypothesized that preparations of aspirin-containing mgst (mgst-asa) are less effective in preventing thrombosis in clinical settings. The risk of composite cardiovascular events in patients treated with mgst-asa preparations for preventing secondary stroke was evaluated. This retrospective cohort study used taiwan's claims data from 1997 to 2013. Patients who were discharged after ischemic stroke (is) and administered with only mgst-asa or non-mgst-asa preparations were enrolled. Composite events including all-cause mortality, is hospitalization, and myocardial infarction-related hospitalization in the follow-up period under therapy with mgst-asa or non-mgst-asa preparations were considered primary outcomes. Hazard ratios (hrs) were adjusted with the baseline comorbidities and medications using the cox model. A total of 19 500 patients with is (60% males, average age 67 years) were identified, which included 2064 patients receiving mgst-asa treatment initially and 17 436 patients receiving non-mgst-asa preparation initially. The crude incidence of composite events was 11.65 per 100 person-years, whereas it was 11.45 and 13.90 per 100 person-years for patients receiving non-mgst-asa and mgst-asa treatments, respectively. The risk of composite events was higher in patients receiving mgst-asa preparations than in those receiving non-mgst-asa formulations, with the adjusted hr being 1.23 at 95% confidence interval of 1.02 to 1.47. Mgst-asa preparation use was associated with a higher risk of composite events than non-mgst-asa preparations. Review of aspirin formulations under regulatory intervention is warranted.",32954579

During the 10 years of observation, 78 incidents were reviewed by the incident review network and addressed through routine measures. Their number has varied throughout the years with a significant decrease after 2012. Incidents mainly covered safety (56%) and quality (34%) issues or a combination thereof (5%). The majority (70%) were notified by eu regulators and involved centrally and nationally authorized product in similar proportions. A referral was recommended as the assessment pathway for 47% of the issues while lines-to-take were the most frequent communication measure (the sole measure in 65% cases). Forty-six per cent of the issues resulted in a variation, whereas 22% resulted in maintenance of the marketing authorization.

Japanese health insurance claims and medical check-up data from october 2015 to march 2017 were analyzed to assess factors associated with target sua achievement in gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis in gout. Target sua was further assessed by subgroup analysis of urate-lowering therapy (ult) prescriptions and outcomes, stratified by renal function. Patients achieving target sua tended toward older, female, higher ult dose, higher adherence, more comorbidities, and/or antidiabetic drugs prescribed. Renal dysfunction and/or diuretic prescriptions were associated with reduced achievement of target sua. Severe renal dysfunction was particularly influential (odds ratio [or] = 0.22 [95% confidence interval (ci): 0.10-0.48] for <15, 0.15 [0.10-0.23] for ≥15 to <30, compared with egfr ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m  ). Across all renal function categories, mean prescribed ult dose was low (febuxostat 17.0-21.0 mg/day, allopurinol 123.1-139.6 mg/day), and target sua achievement was reduced among renal dysfunction patients. Gouty arthritis was more likely in patients with a prior history of such occurrences, and less likely for higher ult adherence, sua monitored regularly at medical facilities, and/or more comorbidities. In a real-world setting, severe renal dysfunction is the most important risk factor for failure to achieve the target sua, suggesting suboptimal disease management in patients with gout or hyperuricemia complicated by this condition. Findings associated with gouty arthritis suggest that these occurrences could be successfully managed by regular monitoring of sua and closer adherence to ult.",32939919

The effect of these policies on the increase of out-pocket payment is unclear. To understand this gap, we compared the discrepancies in trends between opioid prescription fills vs claims among medicaid beneficiaries. Data from the oregon prescription drug monitoring program (pdmp) and oregon medicaid administrative claims were used to identify medicaid beneficiaries 18 years and older enrolled at least one full month from 2015 to 2017. Generalized linear models assessed the trends in the monthly rates of opioid pdmp prescription fills and pharmacy claims per 1000 eligible members. Rates by morphine equivalent dose (med) tier (<50, 50-89, 90-120, >120 med) and co-prescribed opioid and benzodiazepine were also assessed. During the study period, an average of 495 355 medicaid members had 2 797 054 opioid pdmp fills and 2 472 155 opioid medicaid pharmacy claims. Study participants had 15.4 (95% confidence interval [ci] 13.6 to 17.0; p < .001) more prescriptions per 1000 member per month in the pdmp data (114.1 [sd 7.4]) compared with the medicaid claims data (98.7 [sd 7.9]). Similarly, there were 1.9 more co-occurring opioid/benzodiazepine prescriptions per 1000 members per month observed in the pdmp data than the medicaid claims data (95% ci 1.7 to 2.1; p < .001). At each med tier, the pdmp fills were consistently higher than the claims (p < .001). Higher rate of fills in the pdmp compared to pharmacy claims suggests that there may be an increasing trend of out-of-pocket payment among medicaid beneficiaries.",32939909

Medication use among pregnant women in new south wales, australia was identified using linked perinatal and pharmaceutical dispensing data from 2006 to 2012. Medication use in women of childbearing age (including pregnant women) was identified using pharmaceutical dispensing data for a 10% random sample of the australian population. Pregnant social security beneficiaries (n = 111 612) were age-matched (1:3) to female social security beneficiaries in the 10% sample. For each medication, the risk it was dispensed during pregnancy relative to being dispensed during an equivalent time period among matched controls was computed. Medications were mapped to australian pregnancy risk categories. Of the 181 included medications, 35 were statistically significantly more commonly dispensed to pregnant women than control women. Of these, 23 are categorised as posing no increased risk to the foetus. Among medications suspected of causing harm or having insufficient safety data, the strongest associations were observed for hydralazine, ondansetron, dalteparin sodium and ranitidine. Use was less likely during pregnancy than control periods for 127 medications, with the strongest associations observed for hormonal contraceptives and progestogens. Most medications found to be used disproportionately more by pregnant women are indicated for pregnancy-related problems. A large number of medications were used disproportionately less among pregnant women, where avoidance of some of these medications may pose a greater risk of harm. For many other medications avoided during pregnancy, current data are insufficient to inform this risk-benefit assessment.",32935407

This study evaluated the validity of various case-finding methodologies to identify neural tube defects (ntds) in infants using an electronic healthcare database. This analysis used data generated from a study whose primary aim was to evaluate the association between first-trimester maternal prescription opioid use and ntds. The study was conducted within the medication exposure in pregnancy risk evaluation program. A broad approach was used to identify potential ntds including diagnosis and procedure codes from inpatient and outpatient settings, death certificates and birth defect flags in birth certificates. Potential ntd cases were chart abstracted and confirmed by clinical experts. Positive predictive values (ppvs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% ci) are reported. The cohort included 113 168 singleton live-born infants: 55 960 infants with opioid exposure in pregnancy and 57 208 infants unexposed in pregnancy. Seventy-three potential ntd cases were available for the validation analysis. The overall ppv was 41% using all diagnosis and procedure codes plus birth certificates. Restricting approaches to codes recorded in the infants' medical record or to birth certificate flags increased the ppvs (72% and 80%, respectively) but missed a substantial proportion of confirmed ntds. Codes in electronic healthcare data did not accurately identify confirmed ntds. These results indicate that chart review with adjudication of outcomes is important when conducting observational studies of ntds using electronic healthcare data.",32929845

By updating an earlier systematic review, we summarize modern statistical best practices for evaluating and correcting for potential bias due to unmeasured confounding in estimating causal treatment effect from non-interventional studies. We suggest a hierarchical structure for assessing unmeasured confounding. First, for initial sensitivity analyses, we strongly recommend applying a recently developed method, the e-value, that is straightforward to apply and does not require prior knowledge or assumptions about the unmeasured confounder(s). When some such knowledge is available, the e-value could be supplemented by the rule-out or array method at this step. If these initial analyses suggest results may not be robust to unmeasured confounding, subsequent analyses could be conducted using more specialized statistical methods, which we categorize based on whether they require access to external data on the suspected unmeasured confounder(s), internal data, or no data. Other factors for choosing the subsequent sensitivity analysis methods are also introduced and discussed, including the types of unmeasured confounders and whether the subsequent sensitivity analysis is intended to provide a corrected causal treatment effect. Various analytical methods have been proposed to address unmeasured confounding, but little research has discussed a structured approach to select appropriate methods in practice. In providing practical suggestions for choosing appropriate initial and, potentially, more specialized subsequent sensitivity analyses, we hope to facilitate the widespread reporting of such sensitivity analyses in non-interventional studies. The suggested approach also has the potential to inform pre-specification of sensitivity analyses before executing the analysis, and therefore increase the transparency and limit selective study reporting.",32929830

Whilst previous observational studies suggested an interaction (with reduced effect of clopidogrel), case-only, genetic and randomised trial approaches showed no interaction, strongly suggesting the original observational findings were subject to confounding. We derived a cohort of clopidogrel users from the uk clinical practice research datalink linked with the myocardial ischaemia national audit project. Analyses estimated the hazard ratio (hr) for myocardial infarction (mi) comparing ppi users with non-users using a cox model adjusting for confounders. To reflect unique characteristics of uk ehrs, we varied the application of hd-ps principles including the level of grouping within coding systems and adapting the assessment of code recurrence. Results were compared with traditional analyses. Twenty-four thousand four hundred and seventy-one patients took clopidogrel, of whom 9111 were prescribed a ppi. Traditional ps approaches obtained a hr for the association between ppi use and mi of 1.17 (95% ci: 1.00-1.35). Applying hd-ps modifications resulted in estimates closer to the expected null (hr 1.00; 95% ci: 0.78-1.28).

Recent examples include the approval of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy for male breast cancer and the inclusion of rwe in the label of paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia. This interest has created an urgency to develop processes that promote trust in the evidence-generation process. Key stakeholders and decision-makers include patients and their healthcare providers; learning health systems; health technology assessment bodies and payers; pharmacoepidemiologists and other clinical reseachers, and policy makers interested in bioethical and regulatory issues. A key to optimal uptake of rwe is transparency of the research process to enable decision-makers to evaluate the quality of the methods used and the applicability of the evidence that results from the rwe studies. Registration of rwe studies-particularly for hypothesis evaluating treatment effectiveness (hete) studies-has been proposed to improve transparency, trust, and research replicability. Although registration would not guarantee better rwe studies would be conducted, it would encourage the prospective disclosure of study plans, timing, and rationale for modifications. A joint task force of the international society for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research (ispor) and the international society for pharmacoepidemiology (ispe) recommended that investigators preregister their rwe studies and post their study protocols in a publicly available forum before starting studies to reduce publication bias and improve the transparency of research methods.

This study compared the incidence rate of osteosarcoma among patients aged ≥65 years treated with teriparatide vs a matched-comparator cohort. This population-based comparative-cohort study matched exposure details for each teriparatide user, identified via medicare part d prescription claims, and up to four comparators based on age, sex, zip code, date of claim for filled prescription, and number of unique therapeutic classes dispensed. Outcomes were identified via linkage with participating cancer registries. All us state cancer registries were invited to participate. Overall, 153 316 patients in the teriparatide cohort and 613 247 in the comparator cohort were linked to 811 osteosarcoma cases from 26 participating state cancer registries (68% of us patients aged ≥65 years diagnosed 2007-2014). Analysis on a subset of cohorts revealed they were balanced for known osteosarcoma risk factors and charlson comorbidity index. Mean duration of teriparatide treatment was 10 months. No osteosarcoma cases were observed in the teriparatide cohort; the incidence rate in the comparator cohort was consistent with the background incidence rate among adults aged ≥65 years. The incidence rate ratio was 0.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.0-3.2). For us patients aged ≥65 years, incidence of osteosarcoma among those treated with teriparatide ranges from 0 to 3.2 times the incidence of osteosarcoma in those treated with other medications. Given low incidence of osteosarcoma, this range of effect is inconsistent with a large absolute increase in osteosarcoma risk.",32894794

Compared to large regulatory bodies, the national pharmacovigilance system in taiwan is still under development, and the aim of this study is to demonstrate how a resource-limited health authority utilizes real-world evidence in decision making. We described different sources of real-world data available in taiwan and illustrated the structural framework that integrates real-world evidence into taiwan's national pharmacovigilance system. Additionally, we reviewed real-world studies conducted in the past 10 years and provided examples to show how these studies influenced drug safety-related decision making in taiwan. During the past 10 years, real-world evidence used when making drug safety-related regulatory decisions in taiwan was mainly generated from nationwide claims databases, but other sources of real-world data, such as national registries and large electronic hospital databases, also became available recently. Different types of real-world evidence, including drug utilization studies, risk evaluation studies, and risk minimization measure evaluation studies, have been used to support regulatory decisions in taiwan. Through collaborations between the government and academics, taiwan has started to integrate real-world evidence into the national pharmacovigilance system. However, future efforts, including linkages between different sources of real-world data and improvements in procedural and methodological practices, are needed to generate more regulatory-quality real-world evidence.",32894792

In this observational study, girls aged 9 to 18 years registered in bifap between 2002 and 2016, were followed up until there was a recorded ibd diagnosis or a referral to specialist indicating ibd. Anonymized profiles were reviewed to retrieve diagnosis confirmation (a positive colonoscopy or biopsy, specialist, or physician's comments mentioning the ibd diagnosis) or discarding (negative procedure results, alternative diagnosis, or family history). ""possible"" ibd were profiles missing that evidence, or had suspected ibd. The prescriptions of intestinal anti-inflammatory agents, azatioprine, and mercaptopurine were collected. The prevalence of ibd was estimated after review. Out of 480 634 girls, 323 had a first ever recorded ibd, of which, 37.8% (n = 122) were ""confirmed"" incident ibd diagnosis, 19.8% (n = 64) discarded and 38.7% (n = 125) ""possible"" ibd. Additionally, 12 ibd records (3.7%) referred to prevalent ibd. Prescriptions were recorded in 94.3% (confirmed), 63.2% (possible), 83.3% (prevalent), and 3.1% (discarded) ibd cases. Prevalence was 52.83 ""confirmed"" or 93.58/10  girls when ""possible"" ibd were added. For a third of the girls, the first recorded ibd included evidence confirming the diagnosis while most of those with missing evidence had treatment indicated for ibd. For research focused in sensitivity, an algorithm including ""possible"" plus ""confirmed"" episodes is recommended, whereas only ""confirmed"" to guarantee higher predictive value.

The iraes were defined using the preferred terms of the medical dictionary for regulatory activities. Iraes were categorized as follows: adrenal insufficiency, colitis, eye diseases, hematological disorder, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, nephritis/renal dysfunction, pneumonitis, rash, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. We used several indices such as reporting odds ratio (ror) to assess disproportionality in pharmacovigilance data, time-to-onset analysis using weibull shape parameters, and the association rule mining technique to evaluate possible risk factors between variables in the spontaneous reporting system database. The jader database contained 534 688 reports from april 2004 to june 2018. The rors of pneumonitis including interstitial lung disease for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab were 7.02 (95% confidence interval: 6.55-7.52), 9.08 (8.28-9.97), and 1.74 (1.27-2.38), respectively. The median onsets (quartiles, 25-75%) of myocarditis caused by nivolumab and pembrolizumab were 28.0 (15.5-60.5) and 18.0 (13.0-44.5) days, respectively. Co-therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab may be associated with iraes in several categories as per the association rule mining analysis. Our results demonstrated a potential risk of iraes associated with icis, based on rors and time-to-onset analysis. Furthermore, our findings indicated that patients receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab as co-therapy should be carefully monitored.",32869941

We conducted nested case-control and case-time-control studies using korea's healthcare database (2002-2015). We identified patients without history of hospitalization, cancer, or cardiovascular diseases in 2002. From our cohort, those diagnosed with an adverse cardiovascular event (case), composite of arrhythmia, hypertension, or acute myocardial infarction were matched to two controls using risk-set sampling on various sociodemographic variables. Exposure was assessed in the 1 to 7 days, or in the 1 to 7 days (hazard period) and 91 to 97 days (control period) prior to index date, in nested case-control and case-time control studies, respectively. We compared domperidone to metoclopramide or non-use and estimated odds ratios (or) with 95% confidence intervals (ci) using conditional logistic regression. From 627 799 patients, we identified 71 555 cases and 141 833 controls. In the nested case-control study, while the risk of cardiovascular events was increased with domperidone (or 1.38, 95% ci 1.28-1.47) compared to non-use, the risk was reduced (0.64, 0.57-0.72) compared to metoclopramide. In the case-time-control study, similar increased risk was found when compared to non-use (1.40, 1.29-1.52) but a reduced risk as compared with metoclopramide (0.63, 0.54-0.72). Risk of myocardial infarction associated with domperidone was highest (nested case-control: 1.94, 1.33-2.83; case-time-control: 1.91, 1.01-3.62) when compared to non-use but did not indicate an increased risk when compared to metoclopramide (nested case-control: 0.60, 0.32-1.13; case-time-control: 0.70, 0.25-1.98).

We aimed to understand current practice in addressing this bias in pharmacoepidemiology database studies and to develop an open source application (app) from existing methodology to demonstrate the impact and mechanism of this bias on results. Studies of an exposure and a clinical outcome were selected from all pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety publications during 2017 and any reference to outcome misclassification described. An app to correct risk ratio (rr) and cumulative incidence for outcome misclassification was developed from a published methodology and used to demonstrate the impact of correction on point estimates. Eight (19%) of 43 papers selected reported estimates of outcome ascertainment accuracy with positive predictive value (ppv) the most commonly reported measure (7 of 8 studies). Three studies (7%) corrected for the bias, 1 by exposure strata, and 5 (12%) restricted analyses to confirmed cases. The app (app http://apps.p-95.com/ispe/) uses values of ppv and sensitivity (or a range of possible values) in each exposure strata and returns corrected point estimates and confidence intervals. The app demonstrates that small differences between comparison groups in ppv or sensitivity can introduce bias even when accuracy estimates are high. Outcome misclassification is not usually corrected in pharmacoepidemiology database studies although correction methods using routinely measured indices are available. Error indices are needed for each comparison group to correct rr estimates for these errors. The app should encourage understanding of this bias and increase adjustment.",32860317

The secondary aim was to compare reported adverse drug reactions (adrs) with information described in the summary of product characteristics (spc) and to generate knowledge about characteristics, like time to onset and outcome of adrs. This knowledge is important for drug regulators and clinical practice to understand and manage adrs better. A prospective, observational web-based cohort event monitoring study among first-time users of glp-1 agonists and dpp-4 inhibitors. Patients were recruited through community pharmacies from 2008 to 2016. Participants were invited to complete six web-based questionnaires over a 1-year periods after start of the antidiabetic agent. Questions were posed about patient characteristics, drug use, and adrs. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Then, 743 patients were included. Also 62% of all glp-1 agonist users (total n = 119) and 33% of dpp-4 inhibitor users (total n = 624) experienced an adr. Of the 10 most reported adrs, for glp-1 agonist all, and for dpp-4 inhibitors 8 were described in the drug's spc. For 45 (91%) adrs, the patients recovered without discontinuation of the glp-1 agonist and 79 (73%) adrs without discontinuation of the dpp-4 inhibitor therapy. This study gives insight in the safety profile and adr characteristics of the new antidiabetic agents. This study provides important knowledge for healthcare professionals in managing adrs and can be directly applied in consultations in daily practice.",32854158

It is hypothesized that bams with non-selective receptor binding may increase adrd risk more than m3-selective bams. This study compared adrd risk for users of non-selective and m3-selective bams and examines adrd risk associated with overall bam use. Retrospective cohort study of medicare claims for 71 688 individuals who used bam drugs during 2007-2009 without an adrd diagnosis. We compared adrd incidence (2011-2016) between non-selective bam users (fesoterodine, flavoxate, oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium) and m3-selective bam users (darifenacin, solifenacin). Logistic regressions compared individuals using target drugs in the same category of total standardized daily doses (tsdd) as a standardized measure of drug exposure, and adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, healthcare utilization, other medication use, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. Secondary analyses compared adrd risk associated with different doses of bams overall. Non-selective bam use (compared to m3-selective) was not significantly associated with adrd incidence. Odds ratios for non-selective use were 0.97 (ci: 0.89-1.04) for 1-364 tsdd, 0.94 (ci: 0.83-1.06) for 365-729, 1.00 (ci: 0.87-1.16) for 730-1094, and 1.03 (ci: 0.88-1.20) for >1094.

Delving into the depth and breadth of reported opioid-related adverse drug reactions (adrs) provides an opportunity to strategize better clinical management and alleviate safety concerns. Retrospective pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis for opioid-related adrs in the fda adverse event reporting system (faers) database was performed. Detailed analysis of patient (sex, age) and report (year of report; reporter: healthcare worker vs consumer) characteristics were conducted using reports from 2004 quarter 1 to 2018 quarter 4. Reporting odds ratios and confidence intervals (rors,ci) were calculated. Of the 1 916 674 adr reports, 300 985 indicated opioids as the primary medication. There was a surge in opioid-related adrs reported in 2018 with six times more reports compared to 2004 and twice the number of reports compared to 2017. The largest ror among the 20 common adrs was depression and suicide-self-injury (ror 3.12, 95% ci 3.01-3.22) for reports in age group ≥65 compared to age group 18 to 64, and lack of efficacy (ror 6.80, 95% ci 6.61-7.00) for males compared to females. Adrs with the largest rors for consumers included lack of efficacy/effect (ror 3.37, 95% ci 3.28-3.46), administration site reactions (ror 3.21, 95% ci 3.11-3.32), depression and suicide self-injury (ror 2.26, 95% ci 2.14-2.38) compared to healthcare professionals. Important aspects of opioid adr voluntary reporting included suicidal ideation in elderly patients and lack of efficacy, especially in male patients.

The computable phenotypes were validated through manual chart review. We adapted and refined existing computable phenotype algorithms for rhtn and stable controlled htn to the pcornet cdm in an adult htn population from the oneflorida clinical research consortium (2015-2017). Two independent reviewers validated the computable phenotypes through manual chart review of 425 patient records. We assessed precision of our computable phenotypes through positive predictive value (ppv) and test validity through interrater reliability (irr). Among the 156 730 htn patients in our final dataset, the final computable phenotype algorithms identified 24 926 patients with rhtn and 19 100 with stable controlled htn. The ppv for rhtn in patients randomly selected for validation of the final algorithm was 99.1% (n = 113, ci: 95.2%-99.9%). The ppv for stable controlled htn in patients randomly selected for validation of the final algorithm was 96.5% (n = 113, ci: 91.2%-99.0%). Irr analysis revealed a raw percent agreement of 91% (152/167) with cohen's kappa statistic = 0.87.

Using a dataset of oregon medicaid beneficiaries linked with prescription drug monitoring program (pdmp) data between 2014 and 2017, we identified patients with high-dose chronic opioid therapy (cot), ≥84 consecutive days with an average daily mme of ≥50 on each of those days. We categorized patients into four mutually exclusive groups based on the trajectory of opioid use in the year after cot: abrupt discontinuation, dose reduction and discontinuation, dose reduction without discontinuation, and stable or increasing dose. Finally, we examined prescription patterns in each category. Among individuals with high-dose cot, 7636 (37.1%) had an abrupt discontinuation, 2577 (12.5%) had a dose reduction and discontinuation, 7739 (37.6%) had a dose reduction without discontinuation, and 2623 (12.8%) had a stable or increasing dose in the year following the cot episode. Among those who discontinued opioid use (n = 10 213, 49.6%), three in four (74.8%) did so without evidence of tapering. Patients who discontinued opioid use were younger, had higher daily mme during cot, and were more likely to have filled a benzodiazepine or had a multiple provider or multiple pharmacy episode compared to patients who did not discontinue opioid use. Dose reductions and discontinuations after a cot episode can be identified in large administrative datasets. Those with a discontinuation were more likely to have riskier prescription profiles during their cot episode.",32844498

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficacy-effectiveness gap of pembrolizumab in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). A population-based ambispective cohort study was conducted. Cases of interest were identified through the national cancer registry database and additional data sources. Patients aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with nsclc and exposed to pembrolizumab, between 23 june 2016 and 31 october 2018, as second or later lines of treatment for advanced disease were included. Patients were followed-up until death or cut-off date (30 april 2019). Primary outcome was overall survival (os). Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (pfs), event-free survival (efs), and adverse events (aes) leading to treatment discontinuation. The efficacy-effectiveness gap was evaluated comparing results with clinical trial data. A total of 181 patients were included. Median age was 63 years (range 33-94); 74.6% were male. Median treatment duration was 5.6 months (interquartile range: 1.4-10.4) and, at cut-off date, treatment had been discontinued in 141 patients, mainly due to disease progression.

We compared three commonly used liver chemistry criteria from the dili expert working group (dewg), dili network (dilin), and council for international organizations of medical sciences (cioms), based on hospital emr for years 2010 and 2011 (42 176 admissions), using independent medical record review. The performance characteristics were compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), negative predictive value, accuracy, f-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc). Dewg had the highest ppv (5.5%, 95% ci: 4.1%-7.2%), specificity (97.0%, 95% ci: 96.8%-97.2%), accuracy (96.8%, 95% ci: 96.6%-97.0%) and f-measure (0.099).

More stringent criteria (dewg and dilin) performed better in terms of ppv, specificity, accuracy and f-measure. Cioms performed better in terms of sensitivity. An algorithm with high sensitivity is useful in pharmacovigilance for detecting rare events and to avoid missing cases. Requiring at least two abnormal liver chemistries during hospitalization and text-word searching in the discharge summaries decreased false positives without loss in sensitivity.",32844466

The final sample included research studies using ≥1 data source from the us. We classified data sources broadly as claims, linkage, electronic health records (ehr), survey, distributed data network, and other. Studies using claims and ehrs were further classified into more specific categories, including special populations of interest (eg, children). We identified 356 abstracts.

They reported on difficulties falling and staying asleep, and early morning wakening. Sleep medication use across 20 years of follow-up was examined for all women and by race/ethnicity. Women who reported data for both sleep disturbance and sleep medication use were included in the analyses.. Among participants in a cohort of 3302 women who were enrolled prior to their menopause transition, 3082 women were included in the analytic sample and 2531 (82%) reported sleep disturbances. They were more likely to endorse higher anxiety and pain scores and more comorbid conditions than women without sleep disturbances. Baseline characteristics were similar among women who did and did not use sleep medications. Among women reporting a sleep disturbance at baseline, 2.5% reported sleep medication use, increasing to 8% over 20 years. However, the proportion of women reporting sleep medication use who did not report a sleep disturbance remained low, approximately 1% to 2% over the entire follow-up. Increases in sleep medication use was observed across women of all race/ethnicities. The use of sleep medications among women reporting sleep disturbance grew over the last 20 years. Growth was observed across women of all race/ethnicities.",32810917

We conducted a cross-sectional study of medications approved by the fda in 2011. For each medication, we reviewed the drug's label and the details of the pivotal clinical trials supporting its approval. We assessed whether each clinical trial could be replicated using an insurance claims databases by determining whether the following pivotal trial features could be reliably captured in claims data: study outcome, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and the presence of an appropriate active comparator. In 2011, 28 new medications were approved. The most common disease areas were oncology (n = 8, 29%), infectious disease (n = 5, 18%), and neurology (n = 4, 14%). The primary outcome of pre-approval clinical trials was identifiable in claims databases for six (21%) of the medications. Two (ticagrelor and linagliptin) had at least 80% of inclusion and exclusion criteria that could be identified in claims databases and had an available active comparator. The non-identifiable primary outcomes were related to patient-reported symptoms (n = 9, 32%), imaging findings (n = 5, 18%), laboratory values (n = 5, 18%), or other measurements (eg, blood pressure) not typically available in insurance claims databases (n = 4, 14%). Among drugs fda-approved in 2011, two (7%) had a pre-approval trial that could be replicated using insurance claims databases. In such qualifying trials, replication using claims databases could be useful in assessing whether they provide concordant results.",32798299

We conducted a review of newly published studies on this topic to determine what new evidence exists and to identify which gaps may still remain. We believe that this information can support fda as it develops and implements future risk communication approaches. We searched pubmed and embase for studies published between january 1, 2010, and august 7, 2017 that examined the impact of labeling changes or associated fda safety-related communications. For each study, we extracted information on research design and findings for key clinical outcomes and behaviors. We also conducted a robins-i review to identify potential for bias in the research design of each study. We found that the estimated impacts of fda labeling changes on several key outcomes-including adverse events-varied. Labeling changes also yielded unintended consequences on drug prescribing in some cases, despite low provider adherence. Finally, some studies we reviewed exhibited potential for bias due to confounding, among other factors. The new studies we reviewed contain many of the same limitations identified in previously published reviews. While there are several challenges to conducting this research there is substantial room for improvement in the quality of the evidence base. More information, particularly with respect to the types of populations and medications affected by labeling changes, is needed to support the development of more effective and targeted safety communications.",32790031

Many of these studies reporting remarkable effectiveness were shown to be affected by different time-related biases. We describe these biases and illustrate their effects using a cohort of patients treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). The quebec healthcare databases were used to form a cohort of 124 030 patients with copd, 50 years or older, treated between 2000 and 2015. Inhaled corticosteroids (ics) and long-acting bronchodilators were used as exposures, with diverse outcomes, including lung cancer, acute myocardial infarction and death, to illustrate protopathic, latency time, immortal time, time-window, depletion of susceptibles, and immeasurable time biases. Protopathic bias affected bronchodilator-defined cohort entry with an incident rate of lung cancer of 23.9 per 1000 in the first year, compared with around 12.0 in the subsequent years. When latency and immortal times were misclassified, ics were associated with decreased incidence of lung cancer (hazard ratio [hr] 0.32; 95% ci: 0.30-0.34), compared with 0.50 (95% ci: 0.48-0.53) after correcting for immortal time bias and 0.96 (95% ci: 0.91-1.02) after also correcting for latency time bias. Time-window, depletion of susceptibles and immeasurable time biases also affected the findings similarly. Many observational studies of new indications for older drugs reporting unrealistic effectiveness were affected by avoidable time-related biases. The apparent effectiveness often disappears with proper design and analysis. Future studies should consider these time-related issues to avoid severely biased results.",32783283

We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative dispensing claims data using the australian government department of human services random 10% sample of all australians eligible for prescription medicines subsidised through the australian pharmaceutical benefits scheme (pbs). Our main outcome measures were the number and proportion of people using at least one prescribed medicine and the specific medicine groups and classes on the day. We estimated the proportion of australians using these medicines using the mid-year australian population as the denominator. We quantified multiple medicine use by calculating the number and proportion of people experiencing polypharmacy (the use of 5 or more unique medicines) and hyper-polypharmacy (the use of 10 or more unique medicines). We found that 9.0 million australians used at least one pbs medicine on september 25, 2018; equating to 27.5 million medicines in use across australia. ""cardiovascular system"", ""nervous system"" and ""alimentary tract and metabolism"" medicines comprised the top three medicine groups. Over 1.8 million people experienced polypharmacy on the day, accounting for 13.6 million dispensed medicines. 1 022 590 (45%) people aged ≥70 years old experienced polypharmacy and 188 930 (8%) experienced hyper-polypharmacy. Rates of polypharmacy were high, particularly in the people most susceptible to polypharmacy-related harm. Strategies to optimise the risk-benefit ratio of medicines and to reduce polypharmacy through ""choosing wisely"" and ""de-prescribing"" in this age group are needed.

Because this disease requires multiple drug treatment and prolonged therapy for several months, followed by a high probability of adverse effects (aes), we assessed ae monitoring for anti-tb drugs in the health care system of kosova. This survey was a cross-sectional analysis performed at the primary, secondary and tertiary health care levels in kosova. We included 930 registered tuberculosis patients within three levels of this health system in our study. Furthermore, we interviewed 62 physicians and 71 nurses at tb health facilities. Data were collected from official tb registers and personal contact with patients for 12 months. The representative age group was 19 to 29 years (30.49%), followed by a group of patients aged >60 years (23.23%). Among 930 patients treated with tb drugs, the total incidence of adverse aes was 29.03%. Female tb patients had a higher rate of aes than did male patients (33.56% vs 28.84%, respectively). The highest incidence of registered aes was recorded in the gastrointestinal system (270, 80.83%), followed by the central nervous system (cns, 7.50%) and was lower in other organ systems. The reporting of anti-tb drug effects by medical staff (tb medical doctor and tb medical nurse) at different levels of tb medical settings occurred among 62.90% of medical doctors and 81.69% of nurses. Only 53.23% of medical doctors and 46.48% of nurses completed pharmacovigilance training. The pharmacovigilance approach in health system of kosova is not comprehensible and not systematic. The relatively low incidence of aes among tb patients is due under reporting of these by medical staff. The knowledge, attitudes, and adherence of medical staff reveal low awareness for pharmacovigilance activities, and this concern should be addressed to reinforce this important issue for the safe treatment of tb patients.",32770586

We compared self-reported triptan use during pregnancy in the norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (moba) to dispensed prescriptions in the norwegian prescription database and calculated cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), sensitivity, specificity and predictive values using moba as reference standard. We used group-based trajectory modeling to estimate exposure trajectories in moba according to probability of triptan use across pregnancy. We identified 6051 pregnancies where mothers filled at least one triptan prescription or reported migraine or triptan use in the 6 months before or during pregnancy. Sensitivity of prescribed triptans during pregnancy was low (39.1%), but specificity was quite high (95.4%). Agreement between the two data sources was fair (κ 0.36). We identified three trajectory groups in moba including constant-high, decreasing-medium and decreasing-low probability of triptan use across pregnancy. Using dispensed prescriptions rather than self-report to classify exposure to triptans during pregnancy is likely to result in substantial under-estimation of exposure.

Total national testosterone prescriptions (private plus pbs) was verified from an independent data supplier (iqvia). Pbs usage peaked in 2014 declining by 30% in 2017-8 with pbs prescribing covering a fall from 97.6% by usage in 2014 to 74% in 2017-18 of all testosterone prescribing. The tighter 2015 pbs restrictions sustained the selective reduction in gp initiation of prescriptions for middle-aged men without pathological hypogonadism whereas specialist initiations and prescription for adult hypogonadism or pediatric/prepubertal indications were largely unaffected. The tightening of pbs criteria from 1 april 2015 to curb off-label prescribing remained effective and selective over 3 years yet total national testosterone prescribing continued with little change, reflecting a shift to private prescriptions. The continuation of off-label testosterone prescribing for unproven indications suggests that long-term androgen dependence is created in men without pathological hypogonadism who commence testosterone. This highlights the need to avoid prescribing testosterone to men without pathological hypogonadism in the absence of sound evidence of efficacy and safety, the latter including the little unrecognized risks of long-term androgen dependency when trying to quit.",32743911

Studies have shown that the doubly robust estimator is subject to more bias than the standard weighting estimator when both ps and outcome models are incorrectly specified. We evaluated whether various machine learning methods can be used for estimating conditional means of the potential outcomes to enhance the robustness of the doubly robust estimator to various degrees of model misspecification in terms of reducing bias and standard error. We considered four types of methods to predict the outcomes: least squares, tree-based methods, generalized additive models and shrinkage methods. We also considered an ensemble method called the super learner (sl), which is a linear combination of multiple learners. We conducted simulations considering different scenarios by the complexity of ps and outcome-generating models and some ranges of treatment prevalence. The shrinkage methods performed well with robust doubly robust estimates in term of bias and mean squared error across the scenarios when the models became rich by including all 2-way interactions of the covariates. The sl performed similarly to the best method in each scenario. Our findings indicate that machine learning methods such as the sl or the shrinkage methods using interaction models should be used for more accurate doubly robust estimators.",32716126

We applied inverse probability of treatment and standardized morbidity ratio weights, as well as inverse probability of censoring weights, to estimate two-year risk differences (rds) for dabigatran vs warfarin. We identified 10,717 dabigatran and 74,891 warfarin initiators. Weighted ot rds suggested decreased ischemic stroke risk for dabigatran vs warfarin; it rds indicated increased or no change in ischemic stroke risk. Regardless of follow-up approach and weighting strategy, risk of death appeared lower and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding appeared higher when comparing dabigatran vs warfarin. Dabigatran use was associated with lower risks of mortality and ischemic stroke in routine care when older adults stayed on treatment. It analyses suggested that these benefits may be diminished under real-world patterns of switching and discontinuation.",32666678

Among new prescription opioid users (1 336 140 persons; 246 466 person-years), the overall opioid overdose incidence rate per 100 000 person-years was 247.1 (95% confidence interval [ci], 227.5-266.7), with 251.0 (ci, 188.6-313.5) in 2002 and 225.5 (ci, 142.0-309.0) in 2012. A lower hazard for opioid overdose was seen for age 65-80 years (adjusted hazard ratio [hr], 0.50; ci, 0.37-0.66) and 80-100 years (0.35; 0.23-0.52) vs 18-35 years; females (0.79; 0.67-0.93) vs males; and other/unknown race/ethnicity (0.71; 0.54-0.93) vs whites. A higher hazard was seen for initial opioid dose in morphine milligram equivalents (mmes), 50-100 mme/day (1.52; 1.24-1.86) and >100 mme/day (1.98; 1.55-2.53), vs <50 mme/day; prior diagnosis of substance use disorders (2.30; 1.91-2.79) or mental health conditions (1.75; 1.47-2.08); and prior prescriptions for benzodiazepines (1.43; 1.13-1.81). In medicaid enrollees in four study states during 2002 to 2012, opioid overdose incidence rate per 100 000 person-years among apparent new users of prescription opioids was 247.1, with 251.0 in 2002 and 225.5 in 2012. Younger ages, white race/ethnicity, higher mme opioid daily doses, prior substance use disorders, mental health conditions, and benzodiazepine prescriptions were associated with a higher risk of opioid overdose incidence.",32648636

However, the optimal length of the look-back period and its impact on incidence rates are often unknown. We studied the impact of the length of the look-back period on incidence rates of 24 different chronic diseases. Everyone residing in sweden between january 1, 2005 and december 31, 2013 were identified from national registries and followed up to 2 years (through december 31, 2015). Outcome events were identified from inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts and incidence rates were calculated per 100 000 person-years. The length of the look-back period was varied with 6-month increments, starting at 6 months. The maximum look-back period of 9 years was used as reference period. There were 7 943 807 individuals with a look-back period of at least 9 years (mean age 46.5 years) and a mean follow-up time of 1.97 years. Incidence rates were higher across all diseases when restricting the look-back to 1 year compared to 9 years, with a magnitude of overestimation of the incidence rates between 13% (temporal arteritis) and 174% (type 1 diabetes). However, for most diseases the effect of extending the look-back period beyond 3-5 years appeared comparably small. This study illustrates how short look-back periods cause overestimation of the incidence rates of chronic diseases, suggesting that sensitivity analyses with respect to look-back period are considered, particularly using data sources with limited information on past medical history.",32648308

Although the risk of memantine abuse is very low, other nmda receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, are well known to drug users. The purpose of this study was to collect data on social networks in order to identify unexpected forms of memantine abuse. A google trends search was used to highlight reddit.com as a major source of social discussions about memantine. Self-reported users experiences posted on reddit.com were recorded and sorted using representative keywords. From 2010 to november 2019, 307 topics citing memantine were identified on reddit.com and 136 users experiences extracted from the topics were recorded. The main use identified was ""self-medication"" based on off-label uses of memantine such as anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 87 reports), followed by nootropic (42) and recreational (39) uses. The average reported doses for acute and chronic uses were 156 ± 110 mg and 23 ± 24 mg respectively. For chronic use, the average duration was 15 ± 29 weeks. Most chronic users (77 out of 100) reported at least one side effect. Memantine misuse seems to be a growing phenomenon. Beyond expected use for recreational purpose; the main uses identified on reddit.com were not reported in the medical literature. Off-label uses and nootropic purposes seemed to be key features of memantine misuse.",32602152

This meta-analysis included data from 18 randomized controlled trials, one cluster-randomized trial, two large observational retrospective cohort studies, and one case-control study. Following vaccination, a risk window of 2 years was defined for ait and ibd and 42 days for gbs. Odds ratios (ors) were estimated using three methods: meta-analysis inverse-variance with continuity correction (primary analysis), pooled estimate, and beta-binomial regression. In all studies apart from the case-control study, 154 398 exposed and 1 504 322 non-exposed subjects were included, among whom there were 141 and 1972 cases of (autoimmune) thyroiditis; 2 and 2 cases of gbs; and 43 and 401 cases of ibd, respectively. In the case-control study, there were 97 cases of ait and 13 of gbs; matched with 802 and 130 controls, respectively.

Commercially insured youth residing in nine us states that implemented pa exclusively for antipsychotics in 2011 or 2012 were identified using a 10% random sample of enrollees in the iqvia pharmetrics plus database spanning 2007 to 2015. Youth were included if they were ≤18 years, met the age criteria of the pa at the time of dispensing, and had at least 1 month of prescription drug coverage from 2007 to 2015. The primary outcome of interest was the monthly prevalence of antipsychotics. We implemented segmented regression of interrupted time series analysis to estimate changes in the monthly prevalence of targeted medications, overall and stratified by age. Trends were compared in the 4-year period before and the 3-year period after implementation of pa policies. Antipsychotics prescribing significantly decreased 6.74/10 000 (95% ci, -9.04 to -4.44) enrollees per month immediately after pa implementation. However, pa was not associated with significant long-term trend changes (-0.06; 95% ci, -0.16 to 0.03). Antipsychotic prescribing in children <12 years-old significantly decreased 0.14/10 000 (95% ci, -0.21 to -0.07) enrollees per month after pa implementation, while prescribing in adolescents 12 to 18 years-old significantly increased 0.32/10 000 (95% ci, 0.16 to 0.47) enrollees per month. While medicaid pa polices for antipsychotic oversight did not affect overall prescribing, there were spillover effects in u.s. Commercially insured children <12 years-old. This suggests that state-level medicaid policies intended to improve the quality of care and safe use of antipsychotics can have broad reach.",32558177

We evaluated whether these medications were associated with incident clinically detected atrial fibrillation (af) or monitor-detected supraventricular ectopy (sve), including premature atrial contractions (pacs) and supraventricular tachycardia (svt). We used data from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (mesa), a cohort study that enrolled 6814 americans without clinically detected cardiovascular disease in 2000 to 2002. At the 2016 to 2018 examination, 1557 individuals received ambulatory electrocardiographic (ecg) monitoring. Longitudinal analyses investigated time-varying medication exposures at the first five exams (through 2011) in relation to incident clinically detected af through 2015 using cox proportional hazards regression models. Cross-sectional analyses investigated medication exposures at 2016 to 2018 examination and the risk of monitor-detected sve using linear regression models. The longitudinal cohort included 6652 participants. During 12.4 years of mean follow-up, 982 participants (14.7%) experienced incident clinically detected af. Use of opioids, gabapentinoids, and nsaids were not associated with incident af. The cross-sectional analysis included 1435 participants with ecg monitoring.

We aimed to evaluate the extent and magnitude of bias in case-crossover analyses of chronic and persistent exposures, using simulations. We simulated cohorts with either 30-day, 180-day, or 2-year exposure duration; and with varying degrees of persistence (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 90% of patients not stopping exposure). We evaluated all scenarios under the null and the scenario with 30% persistence under varying exposure effects (odds ratios of 0.25 to 4.0). Cohorts were analyzed using conditional logistic regression that compared the odds of exposure on the outcome day to the odds of exposure on a referent day 30 days prior to the outcome. We further implemented the case-time-control design to evaluate its ability to adjust for bias from persistence. Case-crossover analyses produced unbiased estimates across all scenarios without persistent users, regardless of exposure duration. In scenarios where some patients persisted on treatment, case-crossover analyses resulted in upward bias, which increased with increasing proportion of persistent users, but did not vary substantially in relation to the magnitude of the true effect. Case-time-control analyses removed bias in all scenarios. Investigators should be aware of bias due to treatment persistence in unidirectional case-crossover analyses of chronic medications, which can be remedied with a control group of similarly persistent noncases.",32548875

In order to enable efficient drug safety alert generation in the french national healthcare system database (snds), we assessed and calibrated empirically case-based designs to identify drug associated with ugib risk. All cases of ugib were extracted from snds (2009-2014) using two definitions. Positive and negative drug controls were used to compare 196 self-controlled case series (sccs), case-control (cc) and case-population (cp) design variants. Each variant was evaluated in a 1/10  population sample using area under the receiver operating curve (auc) and mean square error (mse). Parameters that had major impacts on results were identified through logistic regression. Optimal designs were replicated in the unsampled population. Using a specific ugib definition, aucs ranged from 0.64 to 0.80, 0.44 to 0.61 and 0.50 to 0.67, for sccs, cc and cp, respectively. Mse ranged from 0.07 to 0.39, 0.83 to 1.33 and 1.96 to 4.6, respectively. Univariate regressions showed that high aucs were achieved with sccs with multiple drug adjustment and a 30-day risk window starting at exposure. The top-performing sccs variant in the unsampled population yielded an auc = 0.84 and mse = 0.14, with 10/36 negative controls presenting significant estimates. Sccs adjusting for multiple drugs and using a 30-day risk window has the potential to generate ugib-related alerts in the snds and hypotheses on its potential population impact.

We estimated the occurrence of ed visits from zolpidem-attributed adrs using nationally representative, public health surveillance of medication harms (national electronic injury surveillance system-cooperative adverse drug event surveillance project, 2010-2017). We estimated the number of zolpidem prescriptions using iqvia national prescription audit, 2010-2017. We calculated rates of ed visits for zolpidem-attributed adrs per 10 000 dispensed zolpidem prescriptions and identified time trends and potential inflection points using joinpoint regression. For comparison, we repeated these analyses for sedating antidepressants commonly used to treat disordered sleep (trazodone, doxepin, and mirtazapine). The best-fit regression model for rates of ed visits for zolpidem-attributed adrs by 6-month intervals identified a single inflection point in the second half of 2014 (  = .024) with a 6.7% biannual decrease from 2010 to 2014 ([-13.1%, 0.3%],   = .059) and a 13.9% biannual increase from the second half of 2014 through 2017 ([-1.1%, 31.3%],   = .068).

Risk for each adverse outcome in maori, pacific, european, and asian patients was estimated using multivariable poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, comorbidity and concurrent drug use. 3 023 067 patients were dispensed nsaids between 2008 and 2015. Their total intended duration of nsaid treatment encompassed 2 353 140 patient-years. Maori, pacific and asian patients were younger than european patients (all p < .001). After adjusting for other risk factors, maori (rate ratio: 2.54, 95% confidence interval: 2.23-2.90) and pacific patients (3.17, 2.69-3.74) were more likely to be hospitalised for ugib than europeans (reference), and heart failure (maori: 2.48, 2.24-2.74; pacific: 1.97, 1.69-2.30). Risk of akf was higher in maori (1.46, 1.23-1.74). Higher risk for ugib and hf in maori and pacific patients was most pronounced in males and patients aged <60 years. Inequalities exist in the incidence of serious adverse outcomes experienced by different ethnic groups in nz while using nsaids. Interventions to promote safer use of these medicines are required to reduce this inequity.",32476226

To maintain drug coverage, the policy requires users of originator infliximab or etanercept to transition to biosimilar versions. We present a three-month interim analysis of this initiative. We conducted a rapid monitoring analysis to evaluate changes in health services utilization three months after the policy was introduced compared with a three-year period before the policy's introduction. Using the administrative claims data of the british columbia ministry of health, we assembled three historical cohorts and one policy cohort of users of each originator drug (8 cohorts in total). Cumulative incidences of medication refills, switching, and visits to physicians were the outcome measures used to compare policy and historical cohorts. Likelihood ratios were used to quantify statistical differences between each policy cohort and its respective historical controls. Likelihood ratios above 7.1 were considered statistically significant. The four infliximab cohorts included 436 patients on average, mean age 56 to 59, 53% to 55% females. The four etanercept cohorts included 1826 patients on average, mean age 57 to 58, 60% to 63% females. Three months after the policy's introduction, 21% of patients treated in the policy cohorts transitioned to the biosimilar versions. Health services utilization in the policy cohorts were consistent with the historical cohorts. An increase in visits to physicians was expected but not detected in the first three months of the biosimilars initiative. The impacts of the policy will continue to be monitored.",32463156

The database establishment has started in 2017 by piloting the conversion of electronic health records of one hospital to the observational health data sciences and informatics (ohdsi), observational medical outcomes partnership's common data model (omop). During the pilot phase we have faced several challenges such as limited contribution in providing data by local medical institution due to uncertainty about data governance, diversity of systems used by hospitals, inconsistent coding of medical information, and limited awareness about data structure from participating hospital. The pilot phase was completed in 2019 containing information about patient attributes, medical care, therapies, and other additional services for around 130 000 patients in saudi arabia. The majority of patients were below the age of 50 years (89%), and acute respiratory infections were the most frequent diagnosis. The data quality was acceptable and no major anomalies were detected during the conversion. We demonstrated a successful creation of a pilot database using ohdsi common data model. Our experience with the pilot database could be extended to other institutions to create a national dataset that could be used to generate real-world evidence.",32458499

The parametric waiting time distribution (wtd) has been proposed as a method to estimate such durations. However, when prescription durations vary due to seasonal stockpiling, wtd estimates will vary with choice of index date. To counter this, we propose using random index dates. Within a calendar period of a given length, δ, we randomly sample individual index dates. We include the last prescription redemption prior to the index date in the analysis. Only redemptions within distance δ of the index date are included. In a simulation study with varying types and degrees of stockpiling at the end of the year, we investigated bias and precision of the reverse wtd with fixed and random index dates, respectively. In addition, we applied the new method to estimate durations of norwegian warfarin prescriptions in 2014. In simulation settings with stockpiling, the reverse wtd with random index dates had low relative biases (-0.65% to 6.64%) and high coverage probabilities (92.0% to 95.3%), although when stockpiling was pronounced, coverage probabilities decreased (2.7% to 85.8%). Using a fixed index date was inferior. The estimated duration of warfarin prescriptions in norway using random index dates was 131 (130; 132) days. In the presence of seasonal stockpiling, the wtd with random index dates provides estimates of prescription durations, which are more stable, less biased and with better coverage when compared to using a fixed index date.",32436295

Many studies have assessed the effectiveness of different interventions designed to improve adr reporting. The aim of this study was to systematically map interventions and strategies to improve adr reporting among health care professionals. The six-stage methodological framework of arksey and o'malley was used to conduct this scoping review. Ovid medline, embase, all ebm, and web of science were systematically searched from 1999 to february 2019, and the reference lists of the included papers were also searched for gray literature to identify any interventions and strategies that aimed to increase adr reporting. Two reviewers screened the papers for eligibility based on the inclusion criteria and extracted their key data and analyzed them descriptively. Ninety out of 14 501 papers met the selection criteria. Using computerized registration and active surveillance can increase adr reporting significantly. Educational interventions performed individually or combined with sending reminders and/or feedback, awards, and providing easier reporting channels can improve adr reporting over a short to medium term. Multiple interventions may have more impact than single-component interventions. Multiple interventions could cause a greater increase in adr reporting rates than single interventions. Although educational interventions appear to be effective, few studies have reviewed their long-term effects to ascertain whether the improvements are sustained over time. Studies with a better methodological quality are required on this subject.",32431069

The purpose of this first manuscript is to identify the main challenges associated with dur in the latam region. Drug utilization (du) researchers in the latam region voluntarily participated in multiple discussions, contributed with local data and reviewed successive drafts and the final manuscript. Additionally, we carried out a literature review to identify the most relevant publications related to du studies from the latam region. Multiple challenges were identified in the latam region for dur including socioeconomic inequality, access to medical care, complexity of the healthcare system, limited investment in research and development, limited institutional and organization resources, language barriers, limited health education and literacy. Further, there is limited use of local dur data by decision makers particularly in the identification of emerging health needs coming from social and demographic transitions. The latam region faces challenges to dur which are inherent in the healthcare and political systems, and potential solutions should target changes to the system.",32419226

In our pharmaceutical experience, nsaids are often prescribed by departments that are different from those that diagnosed ckd. That is, nsaids may be prescribed for patients without the advice of the clinicians who diagnosed them. In this study, we aimed to elucidate how frequently such cases occur. We used the large health insurance claims database constructed by jmdc inc., tokyo. We evaluated the proportions of ckd diagnosis and nsaid prescription by different clinical departments and institutions. A total of 224 014 out-patients were included in the analysis; they were divided into ckd (n = 1501) and non-ckd groups (n = 222 513). The internal medicine departments diagnosed ckd most frequently (74.8% of the patients) and surgical departments rarely diagnosed ckd. However, the proportion of prescribed nsaids was high in other departments, especially surgical departments. In the ckd group, 50.4% of the patients received ckd diagnosis and nsaid prescription from different clinical departments; 72.8% of the patients received a diagnosis and prescription from different medical institutions. Our study revealed that nsaids are often prescribed to patients with ckd from different clinicians than those who diagnosed them.",32410339

Therefore, to better elucidate the potential causal impact of fq on aa, we quantitatively evaluated the potential confounding effect of smoking on this observed association. We conducted a series of quantitative bias analyses using three previously published approaches: the e-value approach, the rule-out approach, and the array approach. We additionally conducted a numerical comparison between the rule-out approach and the e-value approach. For an apparent relative risk of 2, the e-value is 3.41, suggesting that smoking needs to be associated with both fq and aa with a minimal magnitude of 3.41 to explain away the observed twofold fq-aa association. The array approach found that the prevalence of smoking among fq users would need to be at least 2.9 times higher (43%) than the nonusers (15%), assuming smoking increases the risk of aa by 7.6-fold. A numerical comparison demonstrated that the results from the rule-out approach are similar to that of the e-value approach when there is a lack of prior data on bias parameters. Using three different approaches, we demonstrate that the strengths of association between smoking and both fq and aa need to be unusually strong to fully account for the twofold increased risk between fq and aa. Therefore, it is unlikely that smoking alone would explain away the association reported in the epidemiologic studies.",32406104

Nintedanib is a protein kinase inhibitor authorized in accelerated regulatory procedures for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf). The aim of this report is to describe the integration of two types of real-world evidence, spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (adr), and observational health data (ohd) in the assessment of a post-authorization safety signal of ischemic colitis. Assessment of the statistical signal of ""nintedanib - colitis"" was undertaken using data from vigibase, ohd from the observational heath data sciences and informatics (ohdsi) collaborative, published literature, and openly available regulatory documents. Evidence synthesis was performed to support bradford hill criteria in causality assessment. Evidence for strength of association, specificity, consistency, and analogy was found upon review of the case series. Ohd was used to calculate incidence rates of colitis in new users of nintedanib across multiple populations, supportive of consistency, and further evidence for strength of association. Literature review identified support for biological plausibility and analogy. Signal assessment was supplemented with characterization of real-world users and exploration of potential risk factors using ohd. An integrated approach using two forms of real-world data, spontaneous reports of adrs and data from observational databases allowed a comprehensive and efficient signal assessment of nintedanib and colitis. Further exploration of the complementary use of real-time ohd in signal assessment could inform more efficient approaches to current signal management practices.",32399991

Therefore, transparent reporting of exposure definitions is important for interpretation of published study results. We aimed to assess the quality of reporting of exposure to identify where improvement may be needed. We systematically reviewed observational pharmacoepidemiological studies that used routinely collected health data, published in 2017 in six pharmacoepidemiological journals. Reporting of exposure was scored using 11 items of the ispe-ispor guideline on reporting of pharmacoepidemiological studies. Of the 91 studies included, all studies reported the type of exposure (100%), while most reported the exposure risk window (85%) and the exposure assessment window (98%). Operationalization of the exposure window was described infrequently: 16% (14/90) of the studies explicitly reported the presence or absence of an induction period if applicable, 11% (5/47), and 35% (17/49) reported how stockpiling and gaps between exposure episodes were handled, respectively, and 35% (17/49) explicitly mentioned the exposure extension. Switching/add-on was reported in 62% (50/81). How switching between drugs was dealt with and specific drug codes were reported in 52 (57%) and 24 (26%) studies, respectively. Publications of pharmacoepidemiological studies frequently reported the type of exposure, the exposure risk window, and the exposure assessment window. However, more details on exposure assessment are needed, especially when it concerns the operationalization of the exposure risk window (eg, the presence or absence of an induction period or exposure extension, handling of stockpiling and gaps, and specific codes), to allow for correct interpretation, reproducibility, and assessment of validity.",32394589

We hypothesize that if statin discontinuation rates are high it may be better to delay statin initiation until patients are at a higher risk, to maximize the benefit of the drug. A four-state health state transition model was used to assess the optimal time to initiate statins after a risk assessment, in order to prevent the highest number of cardiovascular events, for a given risk profile (age, gender, risk) and adherence rate. A clinical practice research datalink dataset linked to hospital episodes statistics and office for national statistics was used to inform the transition probabilities in this model, taking into account observed statin discontinuation and re-continuation patterns. Our results suggest, if statins are initiated in a cohort of 50-year old men with a 10% 10-year risk, we prevent 4.78 events per 100 individuals. If we wait 10 years to prescribe, at which point 10-year risk scores are at 20%, we prevent 5.45 events per 100 individuals. If the observed discontinuation rate was reduced by a sixth, third or half in the same cohort, we would prevent 7.29, 9.01 or 10.22 events per 100 individuals. In certain scenarios, extra cardiovascular disease events could be prevented by delaying statin initiation beyond a risk of 10% until reaching a age (59 for men, 63 for women), based on statin discontinuation rates in england. The optimal time to initiate statins was driven by age, not by cardiovascular risk.",32394495

Surveys of patients and hcps in five european countries. A retrospective chart review permitted linking clinical and safety outcomes with survey responses. Data on 190 patients and 79 hcps (50 physicians and 29 nurses) were analysed. Sixty percent of patients were aware of the pac, of whom 95% had received it. Knowledge of risk of infection was higher among patients who had received the pac vs those who had not (64% vs 46%; p = .013). Infections leading to hospitalisation increased with decreasing patient survey global scores: scores of ≥67%, 34%-67% and ≤ 33% were associated with hospitalisation rates of 2.5%, 5.2% and 8.4%, respectively (p = .4).

The primary objective of this study was to determine if the 2016 expanded boxed warning was associated with decreased fluoroquinolone prescription rates for these three diagnoses. We retrospectively reviewed antibiotics prescribed at a single, large, academic outpatient center for these three diagnoses between january 2013 and may 2018. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare the rate of fluoroquinolone prescriptions before and after the may 2016 fda boxed warning. A total of 10 087 antibiotic prescriptions for these three diagnoses were examined. There was no significant change in fluoroquinolone prescription rates after the fda boxed warning. The majority of inappropriate fluoroquinolone prescriptions were given for the management of uuti. The 2016 us fda boxed warning against fluoroquinolone use for uuti, acute sinusitis, and acute bronchitis was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of fluoroquinolone prescriptions for these diagnoses. Additional research is needed to define how us fda boxed warnings may be incorporated into broader antibiotic stewardship programs to decrease overuse of fluoroquinolones and avoid adverse effects of the drug class, including clostridioides difficile infections and emergence of resistant organisms.",32390266

The aim of this study was to determine disproportionality in case safety reports on adverse pregnancy outcomes between clozapine and other antipsychotics (oap) used during pregnancy. We included all reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (adrs) to antipsychotics registered in the world health organization global individual case safety report (icsr) database (vigibase) in children younger than 2 years and women aged 12-45 years. A case/non-case approach was used to evaluate the association between several pregnancy-related adrs and clozapine exposure during pregnancy, using 2×2 contingency tables to investigate disproportionality and standard meddra queries to select cases. Clozapine exposure was defined as all icsr-adr combinations with clozapine as (one of) the suspected drug(s). Non-exposure was defined as all icsr-adr combinations with oap as (one of) the suspected drug(s). We identified 42 236 unique icsr-adr combinations related with clozapine exposure and 170 710 with oap exposure. Of these, 494 and 4645 icsr-adr combinations involved adverse pregnancy outcomes related with clozapine exposure and oap exposure respectively. Overall, no signal of disproportionate reporting associating clozapine with the studied adverse pregnancy outcomes was found compared with oap exposure. Based on global pharmacovigilance data, we did not find any evidence that clozapine is less safe during pregnancy than oap. Although this is not automatically equivalent to the relative safety of clozapine during pregnancy, these findings add to the convergence of proofs to allow final conclusions and decisions regarding the treatment of pregnant women with clozapine.",32378285

Claims database.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.5021,"Studies of medication persistence in plaque psoriasis have shown inconsistent results, likely due to differing definitions of nonpersistence and of the permissible gap between refills. Also, medication persistence information for two recently approved drugs, apremilast and ixekizumab, is limited. We use the truven health marketscan claims database to assess persistence for six drugs: adalimumab, apremilast, etanercept, ixekizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab. We define the permissible gap in three ways: 150 days for ustekinumab and 90 days for all other drugs (150/90 model); 120 days for all drugs (120 model); and twice the days' supply for all drugs (days' supply model). To estimate unadjusted persistence, we use kaplan-meier curves, and a proportional hazards model to estimate the adjusted risk of non-persistence. Ustekinumab is most sensitive to changes in the definition of permissible gap, likely because of its longer maintenance dosing interval. Among targeted drug-experienced patients using ustekinumab, median persistence is 358 days (95% confidence interval: 343-371) in the 150/90 model and 189 days (179-199) in the days' supply model. Among targeted drug-experienced patients, median persistence in the days' supply model is longest for ixekizumab and secukinumab at 252 (217-301) and 222 (210-244) days, respectively. We also find that adjusted risk of nonpersistence increases by approximately 1% per year at treatment start. The definition of permissible gap meaningfully changes both absolute and ordinal estimates of medication persistence. Each definition has unique limitations, which should be considered when interpreting persistence data.",32364664

Guidelines recommend metformin as initial diabetes treatment, but there is still the question of treatment timing. Thus, the risk of dementia associated with initiating metformin compared with not initiating or delaying treatment was examined. A retrospective cohort study (1996 to 2015) was conducted with electronic health records from veteran health affairs (vha; n = 112 845) and kaiser permanente washington (kpw; n = 14 333) healthcare systems. Patients were aged ≥50 years, had a hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) between 6.5 and <9.5 mg/dl, and did not have dementia or fills for antidiabetic medications before cohort entry. Initiators started metformin monotherapy and noninitiators used no antidiabetic medications in the 6 months after the first qualifying hba1c. The primary outcome was incident dementia. Propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting (iptw) controlled for confounding in cox proportional hazards models. During a median follow-up of 6.2 years in vha and 6.8 years in kpw, there were 7547 new dementia cases in vha and 1090 in kpw. After iptw, there was no association between initiation of metformin (vs no initial treatment) and incident dementia in vha (hr = 1.04; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.95-1.13) or kpw (hr = 0.81; 95% ci: 0.51-1.28). Results did not differ by age, baseline hba1c, or race. Results do not support initiating metformin earlier to prevent cognitive decline and, thus, may dampen enthusiasm for metformin as a potential antidementia drug. Randomized clinical trials could help clarify the relationship between metformin and cognitive decline.",32363681

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the ibm marketscan research databases (2005-2015). Patients with ≥1 mpa or aza prescription claim during the first trimester were included. The study outcome was pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortion or stillbirth). Potential confounders included age, drug indications, comorbidities, other teratogenic medication use, and gestational age at first mpa or aza prescription fill. The risk for pregnancy loss was estimated using a generalized estimating equation model with stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting. In sensitivity analyses, we varied the exposure definition, outcome definition, and the analytical method. Among 111 pregnancies exposed to mpa, 55 resulted in pregnancy loss (49.5%). Among 471 pregnancies exposed to aza, 113 had pregnancy loss (24.0%). The unadjusted relative risk for pregnancy loss was 2.0 (95% ci 1.6, 2.6), and the adjusted relative risk was 1.9 (95% ci, 1.6, 2.3) compared to aza.

Its main purpose is to serve as source of information for independent studies on drug safety and support of medicines regulation activities. This article aim is to describe the characteristics of bifap, how to access the database and a summary of its potential for research. Health problems are registered by primary care physicians as episodes of care and include socio-demographic data, results of diagnostic procedures, lifestyle data, general data, and interventions. A proportion of data on hospitalizations and specialist care are currently available through linkage with other data sources. Emrs of the spanish healthcare system are provided by the regional administrations. Specific data extraction and standardization processes are performed. Bifap includes data from 12 million patients starting in 2001 and updated annually. Validation of drug and diagnosis definitions has been ascertained. Participation in international collaborative projects and a number of articles in peer reviewed journals reflect its contribution to the knowledge of the risks associated with medicines and drug utilization patterns. Bifap is a useful tool for generating scientific evidence on medicines related issues, helping regulatory decision making in europe. The main strengths of bifap are related to large sample size, population-based, longitudinal nature and annual update of data.

Retrospective analysis of the u.s. Food and drug administration (fda) adverse event reporting system (faers) from 16 december 1992 through 27 february 2018 and medical literature using pubmed and embase. We used random sampling and descriptive statistics. We identified 66 cases that met inclusion and exclusion criteria, four of which were identified in the medical literature. Twenty cases reported death and 46 cases reported serious injuries in association with csbs occurring after the use of a z-drug. Fatal cases described events, such as carbon monoxide poisoning, drowning, falls, hypothermia, motor vehicle collisions, and apparent completed suicide. Nonfatal cases resulting in serious injuries described events, such as accidental overdoses, falls, gunshot wounds, hypothermia, third-degree burns, and self-injuries or suicide attempts. Twenty-two cases reported a previous episode of a csb while taking a z-drug prior to the event reported in this case series. The faers and medical literature cases support the need for increased awareness of the consequences that may occur because of csbs associated with the use of z-drugs. Therefore, to protect public health, regulatory actions were taken, including adding a boxed warning, a contraindication in patients who have experienced a prior episode of a csb with a z-drug, and updating the existing warnings and precautions. An fda drug safety communication was also disseminated to alert healthcare professionals and the public of this potential risk.",32323442

However, it is not clear if these benefits are reflected in the broader population. This study analysed the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, treated with abiraterone and enzalutamide, within the scottish national health service. Retrospective cohort study using record linkage of routinely collected healthcare data (study period: february 2012 to february 2017). Overall survival (os) was analysed using kaplan-meier methods and cox proportional hazard models; a subgroup analysis comprised potentially trial-eligible patients. Overall, 271 patients were included and 73.8% died during the study period. Median os was poorer than in the pivotal trials, regardless of medication and indication: 10.8 months (95% confidence interval [ci] 8.6-15.1) and 20.9 months (95% ci 14.9-29.0) for abiraterone, and 12.6 months (95% ci 10.5-18.2) and 16.0 months (95% ci 9.8-not reached) for enzalutamide, post and pre chemotherapy, respectively. Only 46% of patients were potentially ""trial eligible"" and in this subgroup os improved. Factors influencing survival included baseline performance status, and baseline prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels. Poorer prognostic features of non-trial eligible patients impact real-world outcomes of cancer medicines. Electronic record linkage of routinely collected healthcare data offers an opportunity to report outcomes on cancer medicines at scale and describe population demographics. The availability of such observational data to supplement clinical trial results enables patients and clinicians to make more informed treatment decisions, and policymakers to contextualise trial findings.",32316077

The aim of the current study was to explore the effect of an intervention program on the knowledge and attitudes among physicians and nurses regarding adrs reporting. A multicentre study consisted of three phases: filling out a questionnaire; an intervention program; filling out the same questionnaire again. The intervention program consisted of posters, lectures, and distant electronic learning. The questionnaire contained questions about personal/professional demographic variables, and statements regarding knowledge and attitudes regarding adr reporting. The data revealed that the intervention program significantly elevated the ""objective knowledge"" (p < 0.01) and ""practical knowledge"" (p < 0.02) score as compared to the control group, while no significant differences were found regarding ""acquired knowledge"" (p = 0.14). Seniority (p = 0.01) and experience in internal medicine (p = 0.05) were demonstrated as significant factors determining the knowledge of the staff. Obligation was the main motive for reporting in 80% of participants. After the intervention, no differences were found in the ""attitude related to the motive for reporting"" or ""attitude related to the commitment to report"", between the two groups. However, ""attitude related to the need to report"" score significantly improved after the intervention (p = 0.04). The intervention program increased knowledge and attitudes regarding adrs reports. Seniority had the most effect on the influence of the intervention program. The data from this study encourages the necessity to hold ongoing intervention programs in order to improve adrs reporting rate.",32316074

These studies, however, showed inconsistent results. To inspect the association between aspirin use and depression, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies. In august 2019, two authors independently searched pubmed, embase, and psycinfo to retrieve observational epidemiological studies presenting an association between aspirin use and depression. Case-control and cohort studies were included, and odds ratios (ors) or relative risks (rrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for the risk of depression were estimated using a random-effects model. In addition, number needed to harm (nnh) was calculated to measure the rates of depression. In total, 12 observational studies-five case-control studies and seven prospective cohort studies-were included in this meta-analysis. The random-effects model demonstrated a significant association between aspirin use and depression (or/rr 1.10; 95% ci: 1.05-1.16) with insignificant heterogeneity (i  = 23.3%). The risk estimates of depression from prospective cohort studies were similar (rr 1.11; 95% ci: 1.08-1.14), and heterogeneity was not observed (i  = 0.0%). In the subgroup meta-analysis, a duration of aspirin use ≥5 years and a dosage ≥500 mg daily were also associated with depression. The nnh for depression with aspirin use >5 years was 103 (95% ci 91-111) indicating that observed event is rare. Aspirin use was associated with depression in the present meta-analysis. One of the major limitations is the lack of detail and consistency with respect to exposure verification in the included papers. Another limitation is the lack of randomized controlled studies and prospective cohort studies.",32311192

In the secondary analyses, we examined the risk of parkinsonism by type and dose of sga and conducted age-sex interactions. This population-based study included older adults who had a new-onset diagnosis of parkinsonism and who started taking olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine between 1 january 2005, and 30 december 2016. The cox proportional hazard (coxph) model with inverse probability treatment weighted (iptw) covariates was used to evaluate the risk of new-onset parkinsonism associated with sgas, using quetiapine as the reference. We used the generalized propensity score method to evaluate the dose-response risk of parkinsonism associated with sgas. After iptw adjustment for covariates, the coxph model showed that compared to quetiapine, the use of olanzapine and risperidone were associated with an increased risk of parkinsonism. The iptw-hazard ratios are 1.76 (95% confidence interval 1.57-1.97) and 1.31 (95%ci 1.16-1.49), respectively. The dose-response risk of parkinsonism was highest for olanzapine with a hazard ratio of 1.69 (95%ci 1.40-2.05) and the least for quetiapine with a hazard ratio of 1.22 (95%ci 1.14-1.31). The risk of parkinsonism in the 65 to 74-year age group was higher for both sexes with risperidone compared to olanzapine, but the risk increased with olanzapine for both sexes in the 85+ age group.

Eligible encounters were blindly reviewed and linked to administrative data, including icd-9/icd-10 codes. Test characteristics, including ppv, for different diagnostic and procedure codes were generated using a 50% training sample. The gold standard was definite or suspected out-of-hospital va or ca due to cardiac cause verified based on clinical criteria. Algorithms with the highest ppv were then applied to a 50% validation sample to validate performance. From 2004-2017, 598 encounters met eligibility criteria. 174 (29%) had an outcome of interest, with remainder being an inpatient event or ca due to other cause. Within the training sample (n = 263), va codes in primary position had a ppv 94% (95%ci 81%-99%) with low sensitivity (44%, 95%ci 33%-56%). Ca codes in any position or va codes in nonprimary positions had low ppv (18%-19%, 31% respectively). Applying the top three performing algorithms to the validation sample (n = 252) yielded similar ppv values. Contrary to adults, algorithms including a ca code do not perform well for identifying out-of-hospital va and ca due to cardiac cause in the pediatric populations.

We explore the utility, limitations and impact of rwe in the translation of cannabis medicines research into clinical practice using the established literature. A literature search was performed via embase and medline using a diverse range of cannabinoid and rwe search terms. The review provides a snapshot of cannabis medicine rwe initiatives from around the world. Diverse and novel sources of real-world data and rwe include international cannabis registries, surveys, post-marketing data collection and use of electronic or digital health records. The strengths and limitations of using rwe in translational research are highlighted, along with the identification of barriers to rcts involving cannabis medicines. Rwe promises to play a significant role in the evaluation of cannabis medicines around the world. When used appropriately rwe may complement rct data by providing valuable insights into cannabis medicine safety and effectiveness. It is important that real-world evidence (rwe) is used to complement rather than replace randomised controlled trial (rct) evidence on cannabis medicines. Technological advances have created the opportunity to explore diverse and novel sources of cannabis medicine rwe. Although rwe may be more reflective of real-world clinical practice, it cannot provide conclusive evidence of the safety and efficacy of cannabis medicines.

Prior studies have found that costs impact secondary nonadherence to medications but have failed to examine primary nonadherence. The purpose of this study is to examine primary and secondary adherence following the reduction in copays due to the introduction of generic ais. Using surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-medicare data, we identified 50 054 women diagnosed with incident breast cancer between 2008 and 2013. We compare women whose copays would change and those whose would not, due to the receipt of cost-sharing subsidies before and after generics were introduced using a difference-in-difference (dind) analysis. To examine primary and secondary nonadherence, we rely on a multistate model with four states (not yet initiated, user, not using, and death). We adjusted for baseline factors using inverse probability treatment weights and then simulated adherence for 36 months following diagnosis. The generic introduction of ais resulted in patients initiating ais faster (dind = -4.7%, 95%ci = -7.0, -2.3; patients not yet initiating treatment at 6-months), being more adherent (dind ranging in absolute increase of 8.1%-10.4%) and being less likely to not be using the therapy (dind range in absolute decrease of 1.2% at 6 months to 8.8% at 24 months) for women that do not receive a subsidy after generics were available.

The current study evaluated the association between beta-blocker use and pancreatic cancer risk. We conducted a nested case-control study in a large population representative database. Each pancreatic cancer case was matched with four controls based on age, sex, practice site, and duration of follow-up using incidence density sampling. Beta-blocker use was defined as any prescription prior to index date and was stratified into non-selective and selective β  -blockers. The odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (95% cis) for pancreatic cancer risk associated with beta-blocker use was estimated using conditional logistic regression. The study included 4113 patients with pancreatic cancer and 16 072 matched controls. When compared to never users, there was no association between any beta-blocker use and pancreatic cancer risk (adjusted or 1.06, 95% ci 0.97-1.16, p = .16). Analysis by receptor selectivity showed use of non-selective beta-blockers for more than 2 years was associated with a reduced pancreatic cancer risk (or 0.75, 95% ci 0.57-1.00, p = .05). When compared to former users both users of selective β1-blockers and non-selective beta-blockers had a reduced pancreatic cancer risk (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.67-0.90, p = .001) and (or 0.67, 95% ci 0.49-0.92, p = .01), respectively. Beta-blocker use was not associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk. However, long-term use of beta-blockers may be associated with decreased pancreatic cancer risk.",32196836

Using data from the national healthcare group and singapore stroke registry, patients with first-ever ischemic stroke between 2010 and 2014 were included, and categorized based on antithrombotic or statin adherence using the proportion of days covered: high (≥75%), intermediate (50%-74%), low (25%-49%), and very low (<25%). The primary outcome was first recurrent ischemic stroke within a year after hospital discharge, while the secondary composite outcomes were (a) stroke recurrence and all-cause mortality and (b) stroke recurrence and cardiovascular mortality. The cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association between medication adherence and outcomes. Adjusted hazard ratios (ahrs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis) were reported. Among ischemic stroke patients prescribed with antithrombotics (n = 1139) or statins (n = 1160) at hospital discharge, about one-third were highly adherent to their medications. Patients with lower medication adherence tended to be younger, were admitted to private ward classes, and were without hypertension. Compared with the patients with high medication adherence, the risk of stroke recurrence was higher in patients with very low antithrombotic (ahr = 4.65; 95% ci: 1.45-14.89) or statin (ahr = 3.44; 95% ci: 0.93-12.74) adherence. Similar findings were observed for the secondary outcomes. Poor adherence to antithrombotic and statin treatment increases the risk of recurrent stroke and mortality in patients after first-ever ischemic stroke. Further measures are needed to improve medication adherence among stroke survivors.",32190948

A cross sectional study was conducted between march and may in 2018. The current survey was adopted and modified from a study that used the questionnaire designed by the world health organization collaborating centre for international drug monitoring. The national pv centers of 22 arab countries were invited to participate in this study. Descriptive analyses were conducted utilizing the analysis services provided by surveymonkey.

While several policy changes have attempted to increase buprenorphine availability, access remains well below optimal levels. This study characterized how buprenorphine utilization in the united states has changed over time and whether there are regional disparities in distribution of the medication. The amount of buprenorphine distributed from 2007 to 2017 was obtained from the drug enforcement administration's automated reports and consolidated ordering system. Data were expressed as the percent change and milligrams per person in each state. The formulations and cost for prescriptions covered by medicaid (2008 to 2018) were also examined. Buprenorphine distributed to pharmacies increased about 7-fold (476.8 to 3179.9 kg) while the quantities distributed to hospitals grew 5-fold (18.6 to 97.6 kg) nationally from 2007 to 2017. Buprenorphine distribution per person was almost 20-fold higher in vermont (40.4 mg/person) relative to south dakota (2.1 mg/person). There was a strong association between the number of physicians authorized to prescribe buprenorphine and distribution per state (r[49] = +0.94, p < .0005). The buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film (suboxone) was the predominant formulation (92.6% of 0.31 million medicaid prescriptions) in 2008 but accounted for less than three-fifth (57.3% of 6.56 million prescriptions) in 2018. Although buprenorphine availability has substantially increased over the last decade, distribution was very nonhomogeneous across the united states.",32173955

Cohort study based on health claims data of 6.7 million subjects from 2008 to 2015. Yearly prevalence and incidence for dual ras blockade with (a) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (acei + arb) and (b) aliskiren and acei or arb (aliskiren + acei/arb) were calculated. We assessed prescriber specialty and associations between discontinuing dual ras blockade with specialist (internal medicine, cardiology, nephrology) visits and hospital discharge in the previous year. A total of 2 984 517 patients were included (age 51.4 ± sd 18.4 y, 48.5% male). Prescription rates for acei + arb decreased from 0.6% (n = 17 907) to 0.4% (n = 12 237) and for aliskiren + acei/arb from 0.23% (n = 6634) to 0.03% (n = 818). Incident prescriptions decreased from 0.23% (n = 6705) to 0.19% (n = 5055) (ace + arb) and from 0.1% (n = 2796) to 0.005% (n = 142) (aliskiren + ace/arb); 59% of acei + arb and 48% of aliskiren + ace/arb combinations were prescribed only by one physician. Of those, 73% (acei + arb) and 58% (aliskiren + ace/arb) were primary care providers (pcps). Discontinuing dual ras blockade was associated with specialist care and hospital discharge in the previous year (specialist care: rr 1.4, 95% ci, 1.3-1.6; hospital visit: rr 1.5, 95% ci, 1.3-1.6). Our results suggest a delayed uptake of treatment recommendation for acei + arb and a higher impact of dear doctor letters addressing pcps directly compared with published research, contraindications, and warnings. Targeted continuous medical education, practice software alerts, and stronger involvement of pharmacists might improve the implementation of medication safety recommendations in ambulatory care.",32162407

More recently, a new paradigm is emerging-specifically within the context of preauthorization regulatory decision-making-for some novel uses of real-world evidence (rwe) from a variety of real-world data (rwd) sources to answer certain clinical questions. Traditionally reserved for rare diseases and other special circumstances, external controls (eg, historical controls) are recognized as a possible type of control arm for single-arm trials. However, creating and analyzing an external control arm using rwd can be challenging since design and analytics may not fully control for all systematic differences (biases). Nonetheless, certain biases can be attenuated using appropriate design and analytical approaches. The main objective of this paper is to improve the scientific rigor in the generation of external control arms using rwd. Here we (a) discuss the rationale and regulatory circumstances appropriate for external control arms, (b) define different types of external control arms, and (c) describe study design elements and approaches to mitigate certain biases in external control arms.

Pd patients initiating r-pr or ir-da as monotherapy between 2008 and 2013 were identified on the clinical practice research datalink. The cohorts were propensity score matched on a 1:1 basis. The incidence of dyskinesia and icd in each treatment cohort and the incidence rate ratios were calculated. Adherence to medication and time to levodopa initiation were also evaluated. We identified 341 patients in each treatment cohort after propensity score matching. The baseline characteristics were generally comparable. Dyskinesia incidence in r-pr and ir-da cohorts was 2.98 (95% ci: 0.74-11.9) and 3.93 (95% ci: 0.98-15.7) per 1000 person-years, respectively (incidence rate ratio of r-pr vs id-da: 0.76, 95% ci: 0.11-5.38). Less than five cases of icd were identified and all occurred in the ir-da cohort. The patients in the r-pr cohort remained on treatment for a significantly longer duration than those in the ir-da cohort (682 days vs 444 days; p < .0001) and had greater adherence to the medication. The median time to levodopa initiation was 417 days (iqr: 205-736) in r-pr vs 297 days (iqr: 111-552) in ir-da cohort. The number of dyskinesia and icd events was lower than expected, resulting in an underpowered study.

Medication exposure is associated with frailty among older adults without id. However, there is little research on this association among older adults with id. The aim of this study was to examine specifically in people with id the association between frailty and medication exposure, including anticholinergic and sedative medication exposure. Data were drawn from wave 2 (2013/2014) of the intellectual disability supplement to the irish longitudinal study on ageing (ids-tilda), a nationally representative study of older adults with id in ireland. A modified version of fried's frailty phenotype was constructed. Drug burden measures were polypharmacy, drug burden index (dbi), anticholinergic cognitive burden (acb) and sedative load model. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and identify associations between frailty and drug burden. This study included 570 participants with id. Excessive polypharmacy (use of ≥10 medications) was significantly associated with being pre-frail (p = .017; or = 2.56; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.19-5.50) and frail (p < .001; or 7.13; 95% ci 2.81-18.12), but dbi, acb or sedative load score were not significantly associated with frailty status (p > .05). This is the first study to examine frailty and its association with medication use including anticholinergic and sedative medication burden among older adults with id.

There have been growing concerns about the adequate supply and safety of porcine heparin. Since the bse epidemic has been declining markedly, the us food and drug administration reevaluates the vcjd risk via use of bovine heparin. We developed a computational model to estimate the vcjd risk to patients receiving bovine heparin injections. The model incorporated information including bse prevalence, infectivity levels in the intestines, manufacturing batch size, yield of heparin, reduction in infectivity by manufacturing process, and the dose-response relationship. The model estimates a median risk of vcjd infection from a single intravenous dose (10 000 usp units) of heparin made from us-sourced bovine intestines to be 6.9 × 10  (2.5-97.fifth percentile: 1.5 × 10  -4.3 × 10  ), a risk of 1 in 145 million, and 4.6 × 10  (2.5-97.fifth percentile: 1.1 × 10  -2.6 × 10  ), a risk of 1 in 22 million for canada-sourced products. The model estimates a median risk of 1.4 × 10  (2.5-97.fifth percentile: 2.9 × 10  -9.3 × 10  ) and 9.6 × 10  (2.5-97.fifth percentile: 2.1 × 10  -5.6 × 10  ) for a typical treatment for venous thromboembolism (infusion of 2-4 doses daily per week) using us-sourced and canada-sourced bovine heparin, respectively. The model estimates the vcjd risk from use of heparin when appropriately manufactured from us or canadian cattle is likely small. The model and conclusions should not be applied to other medicinal products manufactured using bovine-derived materials.",32134162

The french national healthcare system database (snds), covering 99% of the french population, provides a potentially valuable opportunity for drug safety alert generation. Alcapone aimed to assess empirically in the snds case-based designs for alert generation related to four health outcomes of interest. Alcapone used a reference set adapted from observational medical outcomes partnership (omop) and exploring and understanding adverse drug reactions (eu-adr) project, with four outcomes-acute liver injury (ali), myocardial infarction (mi), acute kidney injury (aki), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ugib)-and positive and negative drug controls. Alcapone consisted of four main phases: (1) data preparation to fit the omop common data model and select the drug controls; (2) detection of the selected controls via three case-based designs: case-population, case-control, and self-controlled case series, including design variants (varying risk window, adjustment strategy, etc.); (3) comparison of design variant performance (area under the roc curve, mean square error, etc.); and (4) selection of the optimal design variants and their calibration for each outcome. Over 2009-2014, 5225 cases of ali, 354 109 mi, 12 633 aki, and 156 057 ugib were identified using specific definitions. The number of detectable drugs ranged from 61 for mi to 25 for ali. Design variants generated more than 50 000 points estimates. Results by outcome will be published in forthcoming papers. Alcapone has shown the interest of the empirical assessment of pharmacoepidemiological approaches for drug safety alert generation and may encourage other researchers to do the same in other databases.",32133717

Spontaneous reports, such as those in the food & drug administration's (fda's) manufacturer and user facility device experience (maude), provide early warning of potential issues with marketed devices. This review synthesizes the current literature on medical device surveillance signal detection and provides a framework for application of methods to active surveillance of spontaneous reports. Ovid medline, ovid embase, scopus, and pubmed databases were systematically searched up to january 2019. Additionally, five methods articles from pharmacovigilance were added that had potential applications to medical devices. Among 105 articles included, the most common source of data (84%) was registries; median time between data collection and publication was 8 years. Surgical procedure outcome signal detection articles comprised 83% while 14% were on device outcome signal detection. The most common family of methods cited (70%) was sequential probability ratio. Application of any signal detection algorithm requires careful consideration of influential factors, data limitations, and algorithmic assumptions. We recommend approaches using disproportionality, statistical process control, and sequential probability tests and provide r packages to further development efforts. The small number of published examples suggest that further development of statistical methods and technological solutions to analyze large amounts of data for device safety and performance is needed. Fundamental differences in products, data infrastructure, and the regulatory landscape suggest that medical device vigilance requires its own body of research distinct from pharmacovigilance.",32128936

The number of reports was described as the number of mdrs per unique mdr number and stratified by different variables. The quality was assessed by the level of completeness of the collected pms data. The total number of reports related to mra was 2377, and the number of mdrs per year ranged between 84 in 2009 and 452 in 2017. Most of the reports were reported by manufacturer depuy johnson & johnson and were reported by a physician. In 44.9% of the reports, the device problem was reported as ""unknown."" when the device problem was known, in the majority of cases, it was related to an implant fracture. The quality of the collected data was assessed as low due to missing information. The underlying data should meet high quality standards to generate more evidence and to ensure a timely signal generation. This case study shows that the completeness and quality of the mdrs can be improved.

Harmful effects could be underestimated if rapid discontinuation of use after pregnancy recognition is common. We used conception, a critical biological period, as an intervention in a novel application of interrupted time series analysis (itsa). Among 645 049 pregnancies from the medical birth registry (2005-2015) linked to the norwegian prescription database, we modeled the total number of prescription fills in the 12 weeks before and after estimated conception date with itsa. We examined psychostimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiepileptics (aeds; separated by use for epilepsy or other indications). We used relative measures (%) to compare model coefficients. We also compared number of pregnancies defined as exposed when the earliest fill considered was 30 days before the last menstrual period (lmp -30 days), lmp, or estimated conception date (lmp +14 days). We observed a sudden decline in prescription fills from 2 weeks after conception and decreasing fills thereafter for psychostimulants, antidepressants, aeds for other indications, and antipsychotics excluding incident users. Fills for aeds for epilepsy did not fall after conception. Only 77% of pregnancies with fills for psychostimulants from lmp and 58% with fills from lmp -30 days had fills from conception. Similar figures for aeds for epilepsy were 99% and 96%. This application shows that itsa can help researchers understand rapid changes in patient behavior around conception that have consequences for exposure misclassification in pregnancy drug safety studies. Itsa results can help pharmacoepidemiologists guide study exposure definitions.",32128905

The ppv was 92% (95% ci, 82%-97%) for placental abruption, 82% (95% ci, 70%-91%) for preeclampsia, 74% (95% ci, 61%-85%) for postpartum hemorrhage, 92% (95% ci, 82%-97%) for small for gestational age, and 86% (95% ci, 74%-94%) for noncardiac congenital malformation. Across the perinatal outcomes considered, ppvs ranged between 74% and 92%. These ppvs can inform bias analyses that correct for outcome misclassification.",32124511

However, current analgesic prescribing patterns have not been well defined among hospitalized children. In addition, it is unknown what proportion of prescription analgesics is approved for use in children and what proportion is used ""off-label."" nationally representative data from 52 tertiary care children's hospitals in the pediatric health information system were queried to determine prescribing rates of analgesic medications. We analyzed hospitalizations for children <18 years occurring between 1 april 2010 and 30 june 2018. Food and drug administration (fda) drug labels were reviewed for pediatric information, and prescriptions were classified as on- or off-label based on age, route, and formulation. Among 4.9 million hospitalizations, 1.8 million (37.6%, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 37.6-37.7) were associated with use of a prescription analgesic. Overall, 36.7% (95% ci = 36.7-36.7) of hospitalizations included off-label analgesic therapy, with 26.4% (95% ci = 26.4-26.5) associated with two or more off-label analgesics. Off-label analgesic use was higher among hospitalizations in the intensive care unit (61.5%) or with an operating room procedure (92.8%). Rates of off-label prescribing increased with age, peaking at 50.5% for adolescents. Prescription analgesics administered most frequently were morphine, fentanyl, and ketorolac, with off-label use occurring in 24.5%, 23.1%, and 11.3% of hospitalizations, respectively. Over a third of pediatric hospitalizations were associated with the administration of prescription analgesics that have not been labeled for use in children. Our findings highlight the critical need to ensure that safe and effective analgesics are developed for children and that pediatric labeling is expanded for existing analgesics to inform treatment decisions.",32102118

The goal of this study was to determine the association between initial opioid prescribing characteristics and chronic opioid use after hysterectomy. This study included women enrolled in a commercial health plan who had a hysterectomy between 1 july 2010 and 31 march 2015. We used trajectory models to define chronic opioid use as patients with the highest probability of having an opioid prescription filled during the 6 months post-surgery. A multivariable logistic regression was applied to examine the association between initial opioid dispensing (amount prescribed and duration of treatment) and chronic opioid use after adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 693 of 50 127 (1.38%) opioid-naïve women met the criteria for chronic opioid use following hysterectomy. The baseline variables and initial opioid prescription characteristics predicted the pattern of long-term opioid use with moderate discrimination (c statistic = 0.70). Significant predictors of chronic opioid use included initial opioid daily dose (≥60 mme vs <40 mme, aor: 1.43, 95% ci: 1.14-1.79) and days' supply (4-7 days vs 1-3 days, aor: 1.28, 95% ci: 1.06-1.54; ≥8 days vs 1-3 days, aor: 1.41, 95% ci: 1.05-1.89). Other significant baseline predictors included older age, abdominal or laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy, tobacco use, psychiatric medication use, back pain, and headache. Initial opioid prescribing characteristics are associated with the risk of chronic opioid use after hysterectomy. Prescribing lower daily doses and shorter days' supply of opioids to women after hysterectomy may result in lower risk of chronic opioid use.",32102109

A plethora of statistical methods have been proposed over the years to identify these drug-adr pairs. The objective of this study is to compare a wide variety of methods in their ability to detect these signals, especially when their detection is complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders (drugs that are mistaken to be associated with the adr, since they are prescribed together with the drug that is the adr's actual cause). Twelve methods, 24 measures in total, ranging from simple disproportionality measures (eg, the reporting odds ratio), hypothesis tests (eg, test of the poisson mean), bayesian shrinkage estimates (eg, the bayesian confidence propagation neural network, bcpnn) to sparse regression (lasso), are compared in their ability to detect drug-adr pairs in a large number of simulated srss with varying numbers of innocent bystanders and effect sizes. The area under the precision-recall curve is used to assess the measures' performance. Hypothesis tests (especially the test of the poisson mean) perform best when the associations are weak and there is little to no confounding by other drugs. When the level of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger, bayesian shrinkage methods should be preferred. The lasso proves to be the most robust against the innocent bystander effect. There is no absolute ""winner"". Which method to use for a particular srs depends on the effect sizes and the level of confounding present in the data.",32092786

The study was based on a predefined cohort of patients aged ≥20 years who had been registered for ≥6 months and contributed to the japan medical data center claims database. All patients (cases) had been treated for injuries from january 2014 to december 2016. One-to-four case-control matching was performed for age, sex, calendar day of injury (index date), and follow-up duration. A conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate the odds ratio (or) for pregabalin use within 180 days prior to the index date between the matched cases and controls, with adjustment for comorbidities and relevant drug categories associated with a risk of injury. To minimize within-individual confounding, we also performed a case-crossover analysis to compare the odds of pregabalin use between a 30-day hazard period immediately before the injury and five consecutive 30-day control periods within individuals with injury. Among the 2 324 974 people in the nested cohort, we identified 18 084 cases with injury and 71 885 matched controls. The proportion of pregabalin use was 1.7% (304/18 084) and 1.1% (803/71 885), respectively. The adjusted or for injury was 1.22 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.06-1.40). In the case-crossover analysis (n = 304), pregabalin use was also significantly associated with an increased risk of injury (adjusted or, 1.48; 95% ci, 1.10-2.00).

The aim of this case-crossover study was to apply association rule (ar) analysis to ascertain drug combinations contributing to the risk of aki in adults aged 65 years and older. We sourced a nationwide representative sample of new zealanders aged ≥65 years from the pharmaceutical collections and hospital discharge information. Prescription records (2005-2015) of drugs of interest were sourced from new zealand pharmaceutical collections (pharms). We classified medication exposure, as a binary variable, at individual drug level belonging to medication classes including antimicrobials, antihistamines, diuretics, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Several studies have associated the drugs of interest from these medication classes with aki in older adults. We extracted the first-time coded diagnosis of aki from the national minimal data set. A unique patient identifier linked the prescription data set to the event data set, to set up a case-crossover cohort, indexed at the first aki event. Ars were then applied to identify frequent drug combinations in the case and the control periods (l-day observation with a 35-day washout period), and the association of aki with each frequent drug combination was tested by computing a matched odds ratio (mor) and its 95% confidence interval (ci). We identified 55 747 individuals (mean age 82.14) from 2005 to 2014 with incident aki and exposed to at least one of the drugs of interest. Ars identified several medication classes including antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids are associated with aki. The frequently used medicines associated with aki are trimethoprim (mor = 1.68; 95% ci = [1.54-1.80]), ondansetron (mor = 1.43; 95% ci = [1.25-1.64]), codeine phosphate plus metoclopramide (mor = 1.37; 95% ci = [1.11-1.63]), and norfloxacin (mor = 1.24; 95% ci [1.05-1.42]). We applied ars, a novel methodology, to big data to ascertain drug combinations associated with aki. Ars uncovered previously implicated medication classes that increase the risk of aki in older adults. The finding that ondansetron increases the risk of aki requires further investigation.",32080933

The objective was to assess which factors remained determinants of antidementia drug prescriptions. A cross-sectional study was performed in 2013. Patients suffering from dementia, aged 65 and over, identified in the french national health insurance database were included. Because we anticipated a high correlation between age, comorbidities, and health care use, we first identified the patients' health status by a latent class analysis. Second, we performed adjusted logistic regression models. The explanatory variables were patients' health status, gender, prescription of nonpharmacological treatments (physical and speech therapies), prescription of psychotropic drugs, and access to health care. Among the 3873 patients included, 38% received antidementia drugs. Three latent classes of patients with different health status were identified. Patients with poor health status received significantly fewer antidementia drugs (p < .001). Patients with speech therapy or antidepressant drugs received significantly more antidementia drugs (p < .001), whereas patients with physical therapy received significantly fewer antidementia drugs (p = .006). Antidementia drugs were less likely to be prescribed for patients with poor health status. This result is encouraging for these frail patients who are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of treatments. At the same time, this result encourage targeting specifically patients in good health status for the use of a decision aid, in an attempt to limit prescriptions by involving patients and families.",32067291

We aimed to assess the distributions of cha  ds  -vasc and has-bled scores and c-statistics for outcome prediction in the icd-10-cm era using different mapping strategies. We compared the distributions of cha  ds  -vasc and has-bled scores from various mapping strategies in atrial fibrillation patients before, during, and after icd-10-cm transition. We estimated the c-statistics predicting the 90-day risk of hospitalized stroke (for cha  ds  -vasc) or hospitalized bleeding (for has-bled) in patients identified at least 6 months after the icd-10-cm transition, overall and by anticoagulant type. Forward-backward mapping produced higher cha  ds  -vasc and has-bled scores in the icd-10-cm era compared to the icd-9-cm era: the mean difference was 0.074 (95% confidence interval 0.064-0.085) for cha  ds  -vasc and 0.055 (0.048-0.062) for has-bled. Both scores had higher c-statistics in patients taking no oacs (0.697 [0.677-0.717] for cha  ds  -vasc; 0.719 [0.702-0.737] for has-bled) or direct oacs (0.695 [0.654-0.735] for cha  ds  -vasc; 0.700 [0.673-0.728] for has-bled) than those taking warfarin (0.655 [0.613-0.697] for cha  ds  -vasc; 0.663 [0.6320.695] for has-bled).

A wash-out period for rasb of 6 months preceding admission was used. Hospital data were linked with drug dispensation data and cause of death data. The associations between time-dependent rasb exposure and all-cause death and hf death, respectively, were examined by cox regression models. Interactions by gender and age were also investigated on the multiplicative and additive scales. Thirty thousand seven hundred twenty-one patients were analysed. Fifty-one percent were women. Median age was 83. Fifty-three percent of women and 64% of men received rasb after the index hospitalisation. Younger patients were more likely to receive rasb than older ones. One-year mortality was 28%. Rasb was associated with an overall hazard ratio (hr) for all-cause death of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.75), and an hr of 0.85 (0.77-0.93) for hf death. Interaction analyses showed hrs for all-cause death associated with rasb between 0.12 (0.10-0.13) in the youngest, and 0.80 (0.76-0.84) in the oldest patients. Rasb appeared effective for women and men and for patients of all ages in this hospitalised hf cohort. No gender difference in effectiveness was found. Rasb exposure was low overall, indicating a need for improved adherence to treatment guidelines. Treatment with rasb may be inequitable for women and older patients.",32067283

However, it is unclear whether these prescriptions are usually modified to account for patient age and, in particular, opioid-related risks among older adults. We therefore sought to describe postoperative opioid prescriptions filled by opioid-naïve adults undergoing four common surgical procedures. This retrospective cohort study used individually linked surgery and prescription opioid dispensing data from ontario, canada to create a population-based sample of 135 659 opioid-naïve adults who underwent one of four surgical procedures (laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, knee meniscectomy, or breast excision) between 2013 and 2017. Patient age, in years, was categorized as 18 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, and 75 and over. Postoperative opioid prescriptions were identified as those filled on or within 6 days of surgical discharge date. For those who filled a prescription, we assessed the total morphine milligram equivalent (mme) dose, types of opioids, and any subsequent opioid prescriptions filled within 30 days of surgical discharge date. Results were presented stratified by surgical procedure. For three of the four surgical procedures we assessed, the proportion of patients who filled a postoperative opioid prescription decreased with age (p < 0.001 for trend), and there was a small shift in the type of opioid (more codeine or tramadol and less oxycodone; p < 0.001 for trend). However, the total mme dose of the initial prescription(s) filled showed minimal age-related trends. The proportion of opioid-naïve patients filling postoperative opioid prescriptions decreases with age. However, postoperative opioid prescription dosage is not typically different in older adults.",32056336

Determinants of male breast cancer have been studied, but it remains unexplored whether these are also related to finasteride use and thereby constitute potential confounders. This study aimed to assess whether there are differences between finasteride users and nonusers with regard to numerous potential confounders. In total, 246 508 finasteride users (≥35 years) were identified in the prescription registries of denmark (1995-2014), finland (1997-2013), and sweden (2005-2014). An equal number of nonusers were sampled. The directed acyclic graph (dag) methodology was used to identify potential confounders for the association between finasteride and male breast cancer. A logistic regression model compared finasteride users and nonusers with regard to potential confounders that were measurable in registries and population surveys. Finasteride users had higher odds of testicular abnormalities (odds ratio [or] 1.40; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.36-1.44), obesity (1.31; 1.23-1.39), exogenous testosterone (1.61; 1.48-1.74), radiation exposure (1.22; 1.18-1.27), and diabetes (1.07; 1.04-1.10) and lower odds of occupational exposure in perfume industry or in high temperature environments (0.93; 0.87-0.99), living alone (0.89; 0.88-0.91), living in urban/suburban areas (0.97; 0.95-0.99), and physical inactivity (0.70; 0.50-0.99) compared to nonusers.

Factors studied include age, sex, self-rated health, education, smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions. Polypharmacy was reported by 10% of participants overall, with higher prevalence among older (≥60 years) vs middle aged (<60 years) participants (overall: 20.9% vs 6.0%, p < .0001; for those reporting any medication use: 30.2% vs 15.9%, p < .0001). Middle-aged adults reported different patterns of medication use by polypharmacy status, while older adults reported similar medication use patterns regardless of polypharmacy. Diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, hypothyroidism, and osteomuscular diseases were significantly associated with polypharmacy. Analyses also revealed that there are mauco participants who are potentially being undertreated for conditions like depression. Research into medication use among younger and middle-aged adults and development of possible tools to deprescribe medications in this population are warranted.

For rare conditions, conducting traditional randomized clinical trials may not always be feasible, and rwd and rwe have played and will continue to play an important role. We use three case examples-cerliponase alfa, asfotase alfa, and uridine triacetate-to illustrate how rwd from disease registries, medical records with chart review, and literature, respectively, have been used to generate rwe to support regulatory decisions for selected rare diseases. These examples highlight the need for improving data reliability and quality in existing data to expand use of rwd and rwe beyond ""hard endpoints"" and standardizing data collection for outcome measures in patient registries to expand its utility. We also discuss a recent fda guidance for using rwe in supporting rare disease drug development, including its recommendations about using natural history studies as external control groups for single-arm interventional trials. The external control group needs to be comparable with the treated group. Selection bias and confounding are major concerns because of lack of randomization and unrecognized baseline differences. Use of valid epidemiological approaches can reduce these biases. Lastly, we discuss future directions to expand the use of rwd and rwe to support orphan drug approvals, including the need for including patient experience data as an important source of rwd.",32003065

No difference in the incidence of vhd was observed when comparing ""ever users"" of methylphenidate with ""never users"" (adjusted or 0.52, 95%ci 0.16-1.69). A similar result was found comparing current, recent, or past users of methylphenidate. Differences were not significant when both valid and probable cases were included as events of interest (adjusted or 0.59, 95%ci 0.22-1.63). In this first-ever population-based study on this issue, association between methylphenidate and the incidence of vhd among persons in the 5 to 25 years age range was neither confirmed nor excluded. Additional studies may be required to clarify the presence or absence of this relationship.",32000300

This study was conducted in a sample of italian long-term care nhs. Information on drug prescription, diseases, and socio-demographic characteristics of nh residents was collected three times during 2018. Appropriate use of ppi was defined in accordance with the strongest evidence-based indications and the italian criteria for ppi prescription. Among the 2579 patients recruited from 27 long-term care nhs, 1177 (45.6%) were receiving ppis; 597 (50.7%) were taking them for evidence-based indications. Corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and mean number of drugs were the most important predictors of inappropriate ppis prescriptions. Nh residents receiving ≥13 drugs had about 10 times the risk of receiving a ppi than those taking 0 to 4 drugs. Similarly, residents with more comorbidity had about 2.5 times the risk of receiving a ppi than those in better health. The prevalence of residents inappropriately treated with ppi in individual nhs varied widely, ranging from 22% to 63%. Number of drugs, comorbidity, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants are the most important predictors of the inappropriate use of ppi in nhs. The wide variability between nhs in the appropriate use of ppis suggests the need for thorough drug review in this fragile and vulnerable population. Prescribing patterns linked to evidence-based guidelines and national recommendations are essential for rational, cost-effective use of ppis.",31990131

Our objective was to compare adjusting for the sensitive or specific definition alone vs two novel approaches combining both definitions: a ""two-algorithm indicator"" and a ""two-algorithm restriction"" approach. Each simulated patient had a binary exposure, outcome, and confounder. We created two nested, misclassified versions of the confounder using validated heart failure definitions. The sensitive definition had a sensitivity/specificity of 0.98/0.83, while the specific definition had a sensitivity/specificity of 0.77/0.99. Patients were classified into 3 groups: group 0 did not meet either definition, group 1 met the sensitive but not specific definition, and group 2 met both. The two-algorithm indicator approach adjusted using indicators for groups 1 and 2, while the two-algorithm restriction approach excluded patients in group 1 and adjusted using an indicator for group 2. Adjusted exposure odds ratios (ors) were estimated for each approach using logistic regression. The crude or was 1.33 (95% ci, 1.07-1.63). Adjusting for the specific or sensitive definitions resulted in ors of 1.09 (95% ci, 0.87-1.35) and 1.14 (95% ci, 0.91-1.40). The two-algorithm indicator method returned an or of 1.07 (95% ci, 0.86-1.33). The two-algorithm restriction approach returned an or of 1.02 (95% ci, 0.79-1.29) but excluded 20% of the cohort. The two-algorithm indicator approach may improve adjustment for claims-based confounders by returning a point estimate at least as unbiased as the better of the two component definitions.",31972062

We compared three common methods and their ability to predict subsequent mortality in patients with heart failure (hf). Person-linked population-based datasets were used to identify 4234 patients (56% male, mean age of 76), who survived 1 year (landmark period) following hospitalization for hf in western australia from 2003 to 2008. Adherence was estimated by the medication possession ratio (mpr), mpr modified (mprm), and proportion of days covered (pdc) in patients dispensed a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (rasi) and/or β-blocker within the landmark period. Adjusted cox regression models that fitted restricted cubic splines (rcs) assessed the relationship between medication adherence and 1-year all-cause death postlandmark period. In the landmark period, 87% and 68% of the hf cohort were dispensed rasi and β-blockers, respectively. Mean adherence estimates for rasi and β-blockers were 90% and 79% for mpr, 96% and 86% for mprm, and 82% and 73% for pdc, respectively. In rcs models, mprm was not associated with subsequent 1-year death in either the rasi or β-blocker group, while mpr was independently associated with death in the rasi group only (p ≤ .01). However, pdc as a binary variable (pdc <80% or ≥80%) or continuous variable was independently associated with 1-year death in both rasi and β-blocker groups (all p ≤ .02). Proportion of days covered calculated from administrative drug data provides a more conservative estimate of adherence than mpr or mprm and was the most consistent predictor of subsequent mortality in an hf cohort using rcs analysis.",31958191

Planning a new data linkage requires careful evaluation to weigh the resources required with the potential overall benefits. In response to an international society for pharmacoepidemiology (ispe) call for manuscripts, a working group comprised of members from academic, industry, and government determined priority content areas; appropriateness and feasibility of data linkage was selected. Within this topic, scientific and operational considerations were determined, reviewed, and formulated into key areas, and translated into 12 consensus recommendations. Guidance for feasibility assessment was categorized into five key areas: (1) research objectives and justification; (2) data quality and completeness; (3) the linkage process; (4) data ownership and governance; and (5) overall value added by linkage. Within these key areas, recommendations to consider prior to initiation were developed to evaluate suitability of the linkage to meet research objectives, assess source data completeness and population coverage, and ensure well-defined data governance standards and protections. When creating novel linked datasets, researchers must assess the feasibility of both scientific (data quality and linkage methods) and operational (access, data use and transfer, governance, and cost) aspects. The data linkage feasibility assessment considerations outlined can be used as a guide when designing sustainable linked data resources to generate actionable evidence in healthcare research. These recommendations were constructed for wide applicability and can be adapted depending on the geographic, structural, and data components of the linkage.",31950565

The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of potential ddis/contraindications of real-world prescribed non-art comedication with first-line recommended art in people living with hiv (plhiv) in germany. A retrospective, cross-sectional cohort design was used to collect non-art comedication prescription data from a representative sample of a german health insurance claims database. Plhiv who were prescribed art during 2016 were included in the analysis. Patients were stratified by sex, age, comorbidities, and time on art. Prescribed comedications were used to estimate potential ddis/contraindications for each recommended first-line art per patient based on criteria from www.hiv-druginteractions.org. Records from 2680 plhiv were analyzed. Prescriptions for non-art comedications were common (mean of seven per patient in the overall population, 10.2 in plhiv aged 50 years and older). Antiretroviral regimens with the lowest proportion of patients with at least 1 potential ddi/contraindication were unboosted integrase inhibitor, non-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based regimens that included raltegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (13%), dolutegravir + lamivudine (14%), dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (14%), dolutegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (15%), and bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (19%). Boosted regimens and efavirenz-based regimens presented the highest potential for ddis/contraindications. Comedication with potential ddis/contraindications with art is frequently prescribed among plhiv in germany. Potential risks for ddis/contraindications vary by art, with the lowest potential seen in unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens, including raltegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, followed by three dolutegravir-based regimens.",31950545

If this assumption is not met, an important bias could take place. The association of hip/femur fracture (hff) and use of benzodiazepines (bdz) has a bidirectional causal relationship and can serve as case study to investigate the impact of this methodological issue. To assess the magnitude of bias introduced in a sccs when hff conditions the posterior exposure to bdz and explore ways to correct it. Four thousand four hundred fifty cases of hff who had at least one bzd prescription were selected from the primary care health record database bifap. Exposure to bzd was divided into non-use, current, recent, and past use. Conditional poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (irrs) of hff among current vs non-use/past, adjusted for age. To investigate possible event-exposure dependence, a pre-exposure time of different lengths (15, 30, and 60 days) was excluded from the reference category to evaluate the irr. Irr of hhf for current use was 0.79 (0.72-0.86); removing 30 days, irr was 1.43 (1.31-1.57). Removing 15 days, irr was 1.29 (1.18-1.41), and removing 60 days, irr was 1.56 (1.42-1.72). A pre-exposure period up to 182 days was necessary to remove such effect giving an irr of 1.64 (1.48-1.81). Hff remarkably conditioned the use of bdzs resulting in seriously biased irrs when this association was studied through a sccs design. The use of pre-exposure periods of different lengths helped to correct this error.",31923351

The biosimilars initiative requires users of originator infliximab or etanercept to switch to biosimilar versions of those drugs to maintain coverage. We propose a signal-detection method to provide near-real-time information to policymakers on the impacts of the policy change. The exposure will be the biosimilars initiative, a policy affecting patients using originator infliximab (remicade) and etanercept (enbrel) for approved rheumatologic or dermatologic indications. Two policy cohorts and six historical control cohorts of patients using originator infliximab or etanercept will be assembled using linked and de-identified data from the british columbia ministry of health. Patients will be identified during the 6-month period before the policy anniversary. Outcomes will include medication refills and switching, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and physician visits. Summary outcome measures, such as cumulative incidence or average quantity as applicable, will be examined daily and reported monthly for 1 year. Outcomes in the policy cohorts will be compared with historical controls using likelihood ratios. The results of this rapid monitoring plan will be based on analyses involving approximately 9000 patients: four infliximab cohorts of approximately 430 patients and four etanercept cohorts of approximately 1800 patients. Rapid monitoring results will inform ongoing policy decisions related to the biosimilars initiative, in terms of impacts on both patient health and health services utilization.",31914214

This study evaluated the use of bhms in the routine signal detection analyses of potential first-trimester teratogens, where these models have not previously been applied. Data on 15 058 malformed foetuses exposed to first trimester medications (1995-2011) from 13 european congenital anomaly (ca) registries were analysed. The proportion of each ca in women taking a specific medication was compared with the proportion of that ca in all other women in the dataset (55 cas × 523 medications). Bhms were grouped by either medications or cas or by both simultaneously, and the results compared with analysing each medication-ca combination separately and adjusting for multiplicity using a double false discovery rate (fdr) procedure. The proportions of ""high-risk"" medications (medications which have been shown to carry a moderate to high risk of foetal malformations) identified as potential signals were compared, as well as the total number of potential signals requiring follow up (the effective workload). Bhms identified more high-risk medications than the double fdr method, but the effective workload was larger. A bhm grouping both medications and cas, for example, identified 23% of high-risk medications compared with 14% by the double fdr; however, there was an increase from 16 to 71 potential signals requiring follow up. For comparable effective workloads, bhms did not outperform the double fdr, which is comparatively straightforward to implement and is therefore recommended for continued use in teratogenic signal detection analyses.",31908100

In japan, approximately 88.8% of patients with ntm suffer from mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (mac) lung disease. Incidence of mac lung disease is increasing in particularly among the middle-aged and elderly women owing to a rapid increase in nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. General treatment for mac lung disease is chemotherapy. The type of chemotherapy recommended by specialists to prevent the development of a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria consists of a combination of clarithromycin (cam), rifampicin, and ethambutol (eb). Cam monotherapy is contraindicated by specialists owing to its high potential to induce drug-resistant bacterial strains in patients with mac lung disease. In addition, administering eb at doses not less than 1000 mg d  is not recommended to avoid adverse drug reactions. However, it is unclear how much such treatment cases exist in real world clinical settings. This is because no long-term investigation has been carried out. This study investigated treatment with these drugs from 2005 to 2017, by studying 1135 patients with mac lung disease based on health insurance claims database. Results showed that approximately 9.2% (101 cases) were prescribed long-term cam monotherapy for 3 months or longer and approximately 3.6% (18 cases) were prescribed high doses of eb. Cam monotherapy over a long period of time is potentially detrimental to some patients.

Our example study used medicaid analytic extract (max) data to estimate the relative risk (rr) for prenatal serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) exposure and cardiac defects. Smoking and obesity are known confounders poorly captured in databases. Nhanes collects information on lifestyle factors, depression, and prescription medications. External adjustment requires information on the prevalence of confounders and their association with snri use; which was obtained from the nhanes. It also requires estimates of their association with the outcome, which were based on the literature and allowed us to correct the rr using sensitivity analyses. In max, the rr for the association between prenatal snri exposure and cardiac defects was 1.51 unadjusted and 1.20 adjusted for measured confounders and restricted to women with depression. In nhanes, among women of childbearing age with depression, the prevalence of smoking was 60.2% (95% confidence interval 43.2, 74.3) for snri users and 44.1% (39.6, 48.8) for nonusers of antidepressants. The corresponding estimates for obesity were 59.2% (43.2, 74.3) and 40.5% (35.9, 45.0), respectively. If the associations between smoking and obesity with cardiac defects are independent from each other and from other measured confounders, additional adjustment for smoking and obesity would move the rr from 1.20 to around 1.10. National surveys like nhanes are readily available sources of information on potential confounders and they can be used to assess and improve the validity of rr estimates from observational studies missing data on known risk factors.",31863536

We examined three mapping methods for health conditions (hcs) of interest to the biologics and biosimilars collective intelligence consortium (bbcic) and compared their prevalence. Using cms general equivalence mappings, we applied forward-backward mapping (fbm) to 108 hcs and secondary mapping (sm) and tertiary mapping (tm) to seven preselected hcs. A physician reviewed the mapped icd-10 codes. The prevalence of the 108 hcs defined by icd-9 versus icd-10 codes was examined in bbcic's distributed research network (september 1, 2012 to march 31, 2018). We visually assessed prevalence trends of these hcs and applied a threshold of 20% level change in icd-9 versus icd-10 prevalence. Nearly four times more icd-10 codes were mapped by sm and tm than fbm, but most were irrelevant or nonspecific. For conditions like myocardial infarction, sm or tm did not generate additional icd-10 codes. Through visual inspection, one-fifth of the hcs had inconsistent icd-9 versus icd-10 prevalence trends. 13% of hcs had a level change greater than +/-20%. Fbm is generally the most efficient way to convert icd-9 to icd-10 codes, yet manual review of converted icd-10 codes is recommended even for fbm. The lack of existing guidance to compare the performance of icd-9 with icd-10 codes led to challenges in empirically determining the quality of conversions.",31854053

We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature (january 2007 to july 2018). We included studies examining opioid use for more than 30 days. We classified operationalization of ltot based on criteria used in the definitions. We extracted ltot predictors from multivariate models in studies of opioid-naïve individuals. The search retrieved 5,221 studies, and 34 studies were included. We extracted 41 unique variations of ltot definitions. About 36% of definitions required a cumulative duration of opioid use of 3 months. Only 17% of definitions considered consecutive observation periods, 27% used days' supply, and no definitions considered dose. We extracted 76 unique predictors of ltot from seven studies of opioid-naïve patients. Common predictors included pre-existing comorbidities (21.1%), non-opioid prescription medication use (13.2%), substance use disorders (10.5%), and mental health disorders (10.5%). Most ltot definitions aligned with the chronic pain definition (pain more than 3 months), and used cumulative duration of opioid use as a criterion, although most did not account for consistent use. Definitions were varied and rarely accounted for prescription characteristics, such as days' supply. Predictors of ltot were similar to known risk factors of opioid abuse, misuse, and overdose. As ltot becomes a central component of quality improvement efforts, researchers should incorporate criteria to identify consistent opioid use to build the evidence for safe and appropriate use of prescription opioids.",31851773

To generate real-world evidence on comparative safety and effectiveness of these drugs, a claims-based algorithm that can accurately identify psa is greatly needed. To identify patients with psa, we developed seven claims-based algorithms based on a combination of diagnosis codes and medication dispensing using the claims data from medicare parts a/b/d linked to electronic medical records (2012-2014). Two physicians independently conducted a chart review using the treating physician's diagnosis of psa as the gold standard. We calculated the positive predictive value (ppv) and 95% confidence intervals of each algorithm. Of the total 2157 records identified by the seven algorithms, 45% of the records had relevant clinical data to determine the presence of psa. The ppv of the algorithms ranged from 75.2% (algorithm 1: ≥2 diagnosis codes for psa and ≥1 diagnosis code for psoriasis) to 88.6% (algorithm 7: ≥2 diagnosis codes for psa with ≥1 code by rheumatologist and ≥1 dispensing for psa medication). Having ≥2 diagnosis codes and ≥1 dispensing for psa medications (algorithm 6) also had ppv of 82.4%. All seven claims-based algorithms demonstrated a moderately high ppv of 75% to 89% in identifying psa. The use of ≥2 diagnosis codes plus ≥1 prescription claim for psa appears to be a valid and efficient tool in identifying psa patients in the claims data, while broader algorithms based on diagnoses without a prescription claim also have reasonably good ppvs.",31849154

We identified use of filgrastim (reference, tbo-filgrastim, and filgrastim-sndz) and infliximab (reference, infliximab-dyyb, and infliximab-abda) in the sentinel distributed database using healthcare common procedure coding system (hcpcs) codes and national drug codes (ndcs) from january 2015 to august 2018. We calculated the proportion of use by code type and assessed uptake over time. We compared baseline patient characteristics and treatment indications. Among patients with >1 exposure episode, we characterized gaps between episodes. Use was identified primarily via hcpcs codes (filgrastim: 86.4%-97.7%; infliximab: 87.8%-100%) although some was identified via ndcs (filgrastim: 2.2%-13.5%; infliximab: <0.1%-6.5%). Filgrastim reference product use declined from 89.4% in january 2015 to 30.3% in june 2018, with corresponding increases in filgrastim-sndz (0% to 49.3%) and tbo-filgrastim (10.6% to 20.4%). Infliximab biosimilar uptake was low (9.7% in june 2018). We identified 94 846 filgrastim reference product, 27 143 tbo-filgrastim, and 38 264 filgrastim-sndz users. For infliximab, we identified 125 412 reference product, 1034 infliximab-dyyb, 49 infliximab-abda, and 4855 undetermined biosimilar users. Patients receiving filgrastim products were largely similar, but differences in age, sex, and indication were observed across infliximab product users. The median exposure episode gap ranged from 1 to 3 days for filgrastim and 48 to 50 days for infliximab. Use of biosimilar filgrastim has increased in the united states, but infliximab biosimilar use remains low. Data on identification of biosimilars in claims data and observed gaps between exposure episodes can be used to support drug safety studies of biosimilars.",31828887

This study aimed to estimate the comorbidity burden and its relation to healthcare costs in patients using triptans in switzerland by analyzing a large population-based database. This retrospective cohort study was based on swiss health insurance claims data (2015/2016). The study sample comprised adult patients with ≥1 triptan prescription in 2015. We evaluated pharmaceutically treated comorbid conditions (ccs) and costs (12 months after index prescription) of patients using triptan. Multivariable linear regression models with log-transformed outcomes were performed to identify the factors related to healthcare costs. From a total of 749 092, we identified 10,090 patients using triptans (1-year prevalence of 1.35%), whereas 58.9% had ≥2 ccs. The most frequent ccs were pain- and rheumatologic-related diseases and psychological disorders. Among triptan users, the mean total healthcare costs were highest in older patients with ≥2 ccs (>64 years: migraine with ≥2 cc ""12 331 sfr""). Multivariate regression analyses showed that psychological disorders had the strongest impact on healthcare costs (coefficient: 1.29; 95%-ci: 1.27-1.31). The present study provides an overview of comorbidities and its related costs in migraine patients, which helps to quantify the current burden of migraine. This is relevant as the recently licensed cgrp antagonists are likely to change current treatment schemes for migraine, which strongly depends also on the comorbidities. The present study might therefore be helpful for the future development of treatment guidelines.",31828875

The japanese adverse drug event report (jader) database contains a portion of japanese adr reports, and no previous study has described the quality or characteristics of adr reports in the jader. The aim of this study was to identify the characteristics of the jader database and to evaluate the quality of adr reports contained in the jader using the documentation-grading scheme developed by the world health organization. Of 478 508 adr reports in the jader, the analysis set consisted of 395 091 reports meeting inclusion criteria. An analysis was carried out to evaluate the quality of the reports according to the type of report, the type of sender, and the qualification of the reporter. Annual changes in the number of reports from medical institutions submitted by pharmacists were compared with changes in the number submitted by physicians. The distribution of documentation grade differed according to the type of report, the type of sender, and the qualification of the reporter. Regarding ""medical institution reports"", the quality of reports was similar among qualification types, while the quality of reports submitted by physicians was higher for ""company reports"" and ""study reports"" (p < .0001, respectively). Our study showed that the quality of the adr reports in the jader differed among the type of report, the sender of the report, and the qualification of the reporter.",31823506

This review explores how hybrid study designs that include features of rcts and studies with real-world data (rwd) can combine the advantages of both to generate rwe that is fit for regulatory purposes. Some hybrid designs include randomization and use pragmatic outcomes; other designs use single-arm trial data supplemented with external comparators derived from rwd or leverage novel data collection approaches to capture long-term outcomes in a real-world setting. Some of these approaches have already been successfully used in regulatory decisions, raising the possibility that studies using rwd could increasingly be used to augment or replace traditional rcts for the demonstration of drug effectiveness in certain contexts. These changes come against a background of long reliance on rcts for regulatory decision-making, which are labor-intensive, costly, and produce data that can have limited applicability in real-world clinical practice. While rwe from observational studies is well accepted for satisfying postapproval safety monitoring requirements, it has not commonly been used to demonstrate drug effectiveness for regulatory purposes. However, this position is changing as regulatory opinions, guidance frameworks, and rwd methodologies are evolving, with growing recognition of the value of using rwe that is acceptable for regulatory decision-making.",31823482

Certain drugs are known risk factors for oab but have not been investigated in a population-wide cohort. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of prescription drugs in the etiology of the oab. Retrospective cohort study using a population-wide database of 4 185 098 oab-naïve women followed strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology guidelines. We investigated the subscription use of anticholinergic medication and 188 chemical substances, which are suspected triggers for oab (trigger medications [tms]). We hypothesized a relationship between the prescription for one or more tm and the prescription for anticholinergic medication against oab (marker medication [mm]). The use of mm in austria increased from 2009 to 2012 on average by 0.025 percentage points per year (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.015-0.036). In december 2012, 1 in 123 women filled a prescription for any mm, equaling an average utilization of 0.84%. The relative risk of filling a prescription for a mm 6 months after filling a prescription for a tm was 2.70 (95% ci: 2.64-2.77). All investigated medication classes showed a higher risk for the prescription for mm. Medication from classes ""genitourinary system and sex hormones"" and ""systemic anti-infectives"" caused the highest increase in risk (109% and 89%, respectively). Prescriptions for class ""cardiovascular system"" caused the lowest increase in the risk (15%).

We aimed to (1) reveal the complexity of gbtm and (2) assess model discrimination of patient medication adherence patterns. Medicare administrative claims were used to measure statin medication adherence as a continuous value in the 6 months before an acute myocardial infarction (ami) hospitalization. Different gbtm specifications beyond default settings were constructed and compared with the bayesian information criterion. Spaghetti plots were used to compare individual adherence patterns with group averages. Overall, 113,296 prevalent statin users met eligibility criteria. Four adherence groups were identified: persistently adherent, moderately adherent, progressively nonadherent, and persistently nonadherent. Spaghetti plots showed the persistently adherent and persistently nonadherent groups had relatively homogeneous adherence patterns that matched predicted trajectories well. Spaghetti plots also showed that, while adherence patterns in the progressively nonadherent group were not as homogeneous, most patients in this group appeared to be discontinuing statin therapy pre-ami. Subjective decisions are necessary to identify a final trajectory model. Greater transparency and disclosure of these decisions in the medication adherence literature are needed. Individual patient adherence patterns from spaghetti plots provided additional diagnostic information about trajectory models beyond standard model-fit assessments to determine if group-average adherence estimates represent homogeneous patterns of medication adherence.",31802581

We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study among patients with medical and pharmacy benefits enrolled in insurance plans participating in the bbcic drn between 1 january 2013 and 30 september 2017. We calculated the proportion of medical claims with ≥1 ndc and identified select biologics using four different approaches: (a) specific hcpcs alone, (b) specific hcpcs and ndc, (c) non-specific hcpcs with ndc, and (d) hcpcs with modifiers (applicable to biosimilars). Numbers of dispensings were calculated for each biologic by approach and select patient and claim characteristics. More than 1.5 million eligible participants contributed approximately 4 million person-years of data, including 1.2 billion medical claims. The proportion of medical claims with ≥1 ndc increased from 1.2% in 2013 to 3.0% in 2017. Medical claim ndcs identified 39% and 28% of vedolizumab dispensed in 2014 and 2015 and 30% of epogen/procrit dispensed overall. Out of 26,381 filgrastim biosimilar dispensings identified, 51% had a hcpcs modifier and 12% had a medical claim ndc for zarxio. Hcpcs modifiers and medical claim ndcs were present for 38% and 3% of all infliximab biosimilars dispensed (total n = 1,244).

The objective was to assess the association between a material and a social deprivation index and grd exposure following a first acute myocardial infarction (ami) in older adults in the province of quebec. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the quebec integrated chronic disease surveillance system. Elderly ≥66 years, hospitalized for a first ami between january 1, 2006, and december 31, 2011 and covered by the public drug plan were identified. Exposure to grd (i.e. Simultaneous use of 1) antiplatelet, 2) beta-blocker, 3) lipid-lowering and 4) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin ii receptor blocker drugs) was assessed 30 and 365 days following hospital discharge. Associations between deprivation index and grd exposure were estimated with log-binomial regressions adjusting for potential confounders. Exposure to grd was 52.2% and 48.0%, 30 and 365 days after hospital discharge, respectively. No statistically significant association was observed in multivariate analysis for both time points. Thirty days post hospital discharge, adjusted prevalence ratio of non-exposure to grd was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.95-1.02) for most materially deprived vs. Least deprived and 1.04 (95% ci: 0.99-1.08) for most socially deprived vs. Least deprived. Similar results were observed for 365 days. Exposure to grd after a first urgent ami among older adults insured by the public drug plan in the province of quebec is relatively low. Reasons and risk groups for this low exposure should be studied to improve secondary prevention. However, results suggest equitable access to grd, regardless of deprivation.",31797484

The nlp algorithm was developed using an internal nlp tool and training dataset of 311 potential anaphylaxis cases from kaiser permanente southern california (kpsc). We applied the algorithm to the notes of another 731 potential cases (423 from kpsc; 308 from other sites) with relevant codes (icd-9-cm diagnosis codes for anaphylaxis, vaccine adverse reactions, and allergic reactions; healthcare common procedure coding system codes for epinephrine administration). Nlp results were compared against a reference standard of chart reviewed and adjudicated cases. The algorithm was then separately applied to the notes of 6 427 359 kpsc vaccination visits (9 402 194 vaccine doses) without relevant codes. At kpsc, nlp identified 12 of 16 true vaccine-related cases and achieved a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 98.5%, positive predictive value (ppv) of 66.7%, and negative predictive value of 99.0% when applied to notes of patients with relevant diagnosis codes. Nlp did not identify the five true cases at other sites. When nlp was applied to the notes of kpsc patients without relevant codes, it captured eight additional true cases confirmed by chart review and adjudication. The current study demonstrated the potential to apply rule-based nlp algorithms to clinical notes to identify anaphylaxis cases. Increasing the size of training data, including clinical notes from all participating study sites in the training data, and preprocessing the clinical notes to handle special characters could improve the performance of the nlp algorithms. We recommend adding an nlp process followed by manual chart review in future vaccine safety studies to improve sensitivity and efficiency.",31797475

The study cohorts were analyzed for sequential episodes of pharmacotherapy, defined as re-initiating a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy after an initial episode of treatment and washout period. The statistical analysis used propensity score adjusted log-binomial regression models with one-year and two-year fixed follow-up after a 12-week washout period. A sensitivity analysis excluded the washout period. A secondary analysis investigated predictors of receiving a sequential episode of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy results: 116,442 participants of the b.c. Smoking cessation program were analyzed. Compared to nrt, varenicline users were 13% less likely, and bupropion users were 18% less likely, to re-start smoking cessation therapy within 1-year after an initial course of treatment. Sequential episodes of pharmacotherapy identified treatment failures to smoking cessation therapy.

Adherence in the 4 quarters (360 days) before the first cvd hospitalization and 8 quarters (720 days) after hospital discharge was assessed for each individual in the sub-cohort. An interrupted time series design using generalized estimating equations was applied to compare the differences of population-level medication adherence rates before and after the first cvd hospitalization. Overall, a significant improvement in medication adherence rate from before to after the hospitalization was observed (odds ratio (or) 2.49 [1.74-3.57]) among the 946 patients included in the analysis. Patients having diabetes history had a higher or of adherence before the hospitalization than patients without diabetes (1.50 [1.03-2.22]) but no significant difference after the hospitalization (or 1.13 [0.89-1.43]). Before the first hospitalization, we observed that quarterly medication adherence rate was steady at around 55% (or 0.97 [0.93-1.01), whereas the trend in adherence over the post-hospitalization period decreased significantly per quarter (or 0.97 [0.94-0.99]). Patients were more likely to adhere to lipid-lowering therapy after experiencing a first cvd hospitalization.

We aimed to evaluate the prescription of medications during pregnancy applying a novel algorithm. We identified pregnancies in women aged 15 to 49 years registered in the database for pharmacoepidemiological research in primary care (bifap) between 2002 and 2015. The algorithm applied sequential cycles that searched in hierarchical order for indicators of conception, delivery or pregnancy loss, and other codes suggestive of pregnancy. Length of pregnancy was assessed by searching for last menstrual period (lmp) date, gestational age, and outcomes of pregnancy. Prescription of specific drugs during the pre-pregnancy period and first trimester and time trends during pregnancy were evaluated. We identified a total of 155 419 pregnancies during the study period (77.5% completed pregnancies, 21.5% pregnancies losses, 0.8% ectopic pregnancies, and 0.2% stillbirths). Excluding vitamins and supplements, 43.8% of women received at least one prescription during the pre-pregnancy period and 68.4% during the first trimester. During the first trimester, the most commonly drugs prescribed were analgesics (16.3%) followed by antibiotics (11.8%).

Responding to a call for manuscripts from the international society for pharmacoepidemiology (ispe), a working group including international representation from the academic, industry, and contract research, and regulatory sectors was formed to develop a checklist for evaluation of data linkage performance and reporting data linkage specifically for pharmacoepidemiologic research. This checklist expands on the reporting of studies conducted using observational routinely collected health data specific to pharmacoepidemiology (record-pe) guidelines. A key aspect of data linkage evaluation for pharmacoepidemiology is to articulate how a linkage process was performed and its accuracy in terms of validation and verification of the resulting linked data. This study generates a checklist, which covers domains including data sources, linkage variables, linkage methods, linkage results, and linkage evaluation. For each domain, specific recommendations provide a clear and transparent assessment of the linkage process. Linking data sources can help to enrich analytic databases to more accurately define study populations, enable adjustment for confounding, and improve the capture of health outcomes. Clear and transparent reporting of data linkage processes will help to increase confidence in the evidence generated from these data by allowing researchers and end users to critically assess the potential for bias owing to the data linkage process.",31736248

Patients with mgus must undergo regular surveillance and testing, with few known predictors of progression. We developed an algorithm to identify mgus patients in electronic health data to facilitate large-scale, population-based studies of this premalignant condition. We developed a four-step algorithm using electronic health record and health claims data from men and women aged 50 years or older receiving care from a large, multispecialty medical group between 2007 and 2015. The case definition required patients to have at least two mgus icd-9 diagnosis codes within 12 months, at least one serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis and one immunofixation test, and at least one in-office hematology/oncology visit. Medical charts for selected cases were abstracted then adjudicated independently by two physicians. We assessed algorithm validity by positive predictive value (ppv). We identified 833 people with at least two mgus diagnosis codes; 429 (52%) met all four algorithm criteria. We randomly selected 252 charts for review, including 206 from patients meeting all four algorithm criteria. The ppv for the 206 algorithm-identified charts was 76% (95% ci, 70%-82%). Among the 49 cases deemed to be false positives (24%), 33 were judged to have multiple myeloma or another lymphoproliferative condition, such as lymphoma.

One barrier is insufficient details about design elements in published studies. Using a previously conducted drug safety evaluation in claims as a test case, we investigated the impact of small changes in five key design elements on risk estimation. These elements are index day of incident exposure's determination of look-back or follow-up periods, exposure duration algorithms, heparin exposure exclusion, propensity score model variables, and cox proportional hazard model stratification. We covaried these elements using a fractional factorial design, resulting in 24 risk estimates for one outcome. We repeated eight of these combinations for two additional outcomes. We measured design effects on cohort sizes, follow-up time, and risk estimates. Small changes in specifications of index day and exposure algorithm affected the risk estimation process the most. They affected cohort size on average by 8 to 10%, follow-up time by up to 31%, and magnitude of log hazard ratios by up to 0.22. Other elements affected cohort before matching or risk estimate's precision but not its magnitude. Any change in design substantially altered the matched control-group subjects in 1:1 matching.

Data describing to which extent this is being done are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors that may be of importance for the withdrawal of thiazide diuretics in patients hospitalized due to hyponatremia. The study population was sampled from a case-control study investigating individuals hospitalized with a main diagnosis of hyponatremia. For every case, four matched controls were included. In the present study, cases (n = 5204) and controls (n = 7425) that had been dispensed a thiazide diuretic prior to index date were identified and followed onward regarding further dispensations. To investigate the influence of socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors, multiple logistic regression was used. The crude prevalence of thiazide withdrawal for cases and controls was 71.9% and 10.8%, respectively. Thiazide diuretics were more often withdrawn in medium-sized towns (adjusted or, 1.52; 95% ci, 1.21-1.90) and rural areas (aor, 1.81; 95% ci, 1.40-2.34) compared with metropolitan areas and less so among divorced (aor, 0.72; 95% ci, 0.53-0.97). However, education, employment status, income, age, country of birth, and gender did not influence withdrawal of thiazides among patients with hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics were discontinued in almost three out of four patients hospitalized due to hyponatremia. Educational, income, gender, and most other sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were not associated with withdrawal of thiazides.",31730289

Our aim was to assess the association of run-in periods with clinical outcomes of antipsychotics in dementia. We searched randomized placebo-controlled trials of conventional and atypical antipsychotics for neuropsychiatric symptoms (nps) in dementia in electronic sources and references of selected articles. We extracted (a) the presence of a run-in period, use of placebo/investigated drug during run-in (versus washout only), and run-in duration (1 week or more) and (b) the reduction in nps, number of participants with somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), and deaths per treatment group. We pooled clinical outcomes comparing antipsychotic and placebo groups in trials with and without run-in. We identified 35 trials. Twenty-nine trials used run-in. The pooled standardized mean difference in the reduction of nps was -0.170 (95% ci, -0.227 to -0.112) in trials with run-in and -0.142 (95% ci, -0.331 to 0.047) in trials without run-in. The pooled odds ratio for somnolence was 2.8 (95% ci, 2.3-3.5) in trials with run-in and 3.5 (95% ci, 1.2-10.7) in trials without run-in; for eps, these ors were 1.8 (95% ci, 1.4-2.2) and 2.0 (95% ci, 1.3-3.1) respectively, and for mortality 1.4 (95% ci, 1.0-2.0) and 1.6 (95% ci, 0.7-3.4). The use of placebo/investigated drug during run-in and run-in duration did not affect the estimates in a consistent way. The use of run-in in trials might have led to overestimated efficacy and especially underestimated risks of side effects of antipsychotics compared with placebo for nps in dementia.",31730266

In contrast to high-income countries, the epidemiology of this phenomenon is unclear in low- and middle-income countries, particularly among iranian population. This was a retrospective cohort study using iranian health insurance organization claims database. A framework was developed for identifying a set of 18 chronic conditions from the pharmacy claims data in iran. All 2013 outpatient utilizers (aged 18 years or older) were included. Data were analyzed according to number of chronic conditions, gender, and age. The association between mm and utilizations of health services was examined for 2013 to 2016. In total, 481 733 people were included. Cardiovascular diseases (including hypertension) (19.1%), depression/anxiety/sleep disorders (13.7%), and acid-related disorders (10.3%) were the three most prevalent conditions. Mm was present in 21.1%. Although prevalence of mm is higher in older age groups and was present in 40% of individuals aged 65 and older, the absolute number of multimorbid patients was higher in those younger than 65 years (66 271 vs 35 386). Mm was more prevalent among women (22.1%) compared with men (19.5). After multivariate adjustment for age group and sex, each additional chronic condition was associated with an increase of 2.23 physician visits, 2.86 drugs dispensed, 2.32 laboratory tests, and 1.6 medical imaging. Our findings challenge the current single-disease-based assumption implicit in iranian health care system. To take account of mm, complementary strategies should be designed and implement in health care system.",31730260

We conducted a systematic review of the literature that assessed the impact of various strategies to improve adr reporting published in the last decade and compared this with the strategies identified in a previous systematic review. Medline and embase databases were used to retrieve papers published from 01 july 2010 to 17 june 2019. We included papers in the english language that investigated the quantitative impact of strategies used to improve adr reporting. A total of 10,021 articles were retrieved using our search criteria, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. Multifaceted strategies resulted in a point estimate increase in adr reporting of 9.26-fold (-2.21-17.11, 95% ci) versus 7.19-fold (-5.29-32.68, 95% ci) for single interventions. Using electronic reporting tools was more commonly identified as an interventional strategy with a point estimate increase of 13.69-fold (-5.29-32.68, 95%ci) versus 4.42-fold (0.66-8.19, 95% ci) for traditional educational methods. The quality of the majority of publications included in this review was low. Developments in digital technology in the last decade has led to the increased use of electronic reporting tools to improve adr reporting.

We conducted the first epidemiologic investigation into the association between 5ar inhibitor use and gastro-oesophageal cancer risk. We conducted a nested case-control study within the scottish primary care clinical information unit research database. Male cases diagnosed with oesophageal or gastric cancer between 1999 and 2011 were matched to up to five male controls based on birth year, diagnosis year, and general practice. We used electronic prescribing records to ascertain medication use. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ors) for the association between 5ar inhibitor use and cancer risk, after adjusting for comorbidities and aspirin, statin, or proton pump inhibitor use. The study included 2003 gastro-oesophageal cancer cases and 9650 controls. There was some evidence of reduced gastro-oesophageal cancer risk among 5ar inhibitor users (adjusted or = 0.75; 95% ci, 0.56-1.02), particularly for finasteride (adjusted or = 0.68; 95% ci, 0.50-0.94).

Population-based cohort study including live-born and stillborn infants from 1 may 2007 to 31 december 2012. Data from health and administrative registries in denmark and sweden, two nordic countries with universal health care and routine registration of major life and health events. Infants were allocated to three cohorts on the basis of their in utero exposure: the exposed cohort consisting of infants whose mothers were dispensed varenicline during pregnancy; the unexposed cohort comprised infants unexposed to varenicline, but exposed to maternal smoking in utero; and the reference cohort of infants unexposed to varenicline and maternal smoking in utero. The primary outcome was major congenital malformations diagnosed from birth to the first year of life. Secondary outcomes included stillbirth, fetal growth restriction (measured as small for gestational age), preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and sudden infant death syndrome. We estimated the prevalence of the primary outcome and secondary outcomes in the exposed, unexposed, and reference cohorts. Prevalence odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were computed using logistic regression with propensity score adjustment to control for potential confounders. The combined cohort included 885 185 infants. Of these, 335 infants were exposed, 78 412 were unexposed, and the remaining 806 438 comprised the reference cohort. Major congenital malformations were detected among 3.6% of exposed infants, 4.3% of unexposed infants, and 4.2% of infants in the reference cohort. The propensity score-adjusted prevalence odds ratio for major congenital malformations was 0.80 (95% ci, 0.45-1.42) for exposed vs unexposed infants. All analyses of primary and secondary outcomes comparing exposed with unexposed infants yielded odds ratio estimates below or close to unity. Use of varenicline during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse birth outcomes.",31713302

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative claims, maternity care, and laboratory result data from new zealand. We followed pregnant women aged 15 to 45 from gdm diagnosis through delivery and assessed outcomes using maternity care and hospitalization data. We adjusted for covariates using inverse probability of treatment weights and multiple imputation for missing covariate information. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (rrs), risk differences (rds) per 100, and 95% confidence intervals (cis). Linear regression was used to estimate the association of treatment with birthweight. We stratified analyses by ethnicity and infant sex in prespecified sensitivity analyses. We compared 3818 metformin-treated pregnancies with 3450 insulin-treated pregnancies. We observed differences in treatment initiation by ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region, and calendar year. Treatment groups were similar in age, body mass index (bmi), and timing of diagnosis/treatment initiation. After adjustment, metformin was associated with reduced absolute risk of planned elective c-section (rd = -2.3, 95% ci, -4.3 to -0.3), large for gestational age (rd = -3.7, 95% ci, -5.5 to -1.8), and neonatal hypoglycemia (rd = -5.0, 95% ci, -6.9 to -3.2) compared with insulin. There were no clinically meaningful differences in average birthweight between metformin- and insulin-treated pregnancies. We observed variation in estimates by ethnicity and infant sex for some neonatal outcomes.

All patients were invited to participate in the study during the first interview. Adverse drug reactions were reported according to the treatment regimen and frequency of occurrence. Statistical analysis was used to compare adverse reactions between treatments and their associated factors.

Although anticholinergic drugs are commonly used among older people, drugs with potent antimuscarinic properties are considered as potentially inappropriate medications for older people. Here, we examined features of anticholinergic use and investigated predictors for the high use of strong anticholinergic agents (acs) in the elderly. A total of 388,629 korean elderly aged ≥70 years were recruited from the 2012 national health insurance service elderly cohort database. The use of acs in 2012 was quantitatively assessed by calculating standardized prescribed doses. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of the high use of strong acs (≥90 doses). Almost half of the subjects (47.2%) used more than 15 doses of strong acs during 2012. 17.0% of the subjects had an annual cumulative use of strong acs over 90 doses. Morbidities such as depression (odds ratio [or], 95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.56, 2.48-2.63), parkinson's disease (2.41, 2.26-2.56), genitourinary diseases (2.12, 2.07-2.16), polypharmacy (3.28, 3.21-3.36), and low income (1.29, 1.25-1.33) were strong predictors of their high use. Antihistamines (chlorpheniramine) and antidepressants (amitriptyline) greatly contributed to the total prescription of strong acs. Despite the vulnerability of older people to the adverse reactions of strong acs, their use seems to be at a high level in terms of cumulative usage among some elderly. More attention should be paid to older people with predictive factors of high use of strong acs. Key points despite the susceptibility of older people to negative anticholinergic effects, high use of strong anticholinergic agents was is quite frequent; 17.0% of the elderly had an annual cumulative use of these drugs ≥90 doses. Parkinson's disease, depression, genitourinary diseases, low income, and polypharmacy strongly predicted the high use of strong anticholinergic agents. A few strong anticholinergic agents, including antihistamines (chlorpheniramine) and antidepressants (amitriptyline), accounted for the majority of medications prescribed. Understanding the predictors of their high use by medical practitioners may result as more appropriate anticholinergic medications.",31692168

Our objective was to adapt the hdps algorithm to allow for the inclusion of multilevel treatments and compare estimates obtained via this approach with those obtained via pairwise comparisons in a case study using real-world data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cardiovascular events associated with three smoking cessation drugs (varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy [nrt]) using the clinical practice research datalink. We applied the binary hdps algorithm adjusted for pre-specified and empirically-selected covariates to cohorts formed by each treatment pair. We then constructed multinomial hdps models on a cohort of new users of any of the three drugs, adjusting for predefined covariates and different combinations of empirically-selected covariates. After trimming the area of non-overlap of the hdps distributions, the effects of the study drugs on cardiovascular events were estimated with the cox proportional hazards models adjusted for propensity score category. Outcome models adjusted for multinomial hdps estimated treatment effects that were slightly more protective than those estimated in pairwise comparisons (varenicline vs nrt: hr  = 0.60-0.62, hr  = 0.64; bupropion vs nrt: hr  = 0.70-0.72, hr  = 0.76). Trimming rates were similar between the two approaches.

Discrepant severity ranking systems were consolidated on a 0 to 4 scale. Percent agreement (pa) and scott/fleiss' kappa (к) were used to quantify inter-compendia agreement on interaction listings, with linear weighting when consolidated severity rankings were taken into account (wpa and wк, respectively). For dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, poor inter-compendia concordance was observed for interaction listings with ei-aeds, with and without accounting for severity rankings (wpa: 0.54-0.72/wк: -0.08-0.03, and pa 0.47-0.79/к: -0.09-0.09, respectively). Conversely, betrixaban was consistently listed as not interacting with ei-aeds in almost all assessed compendia, despite overlap in p-glycoprotein-based transport with other doacs. Only 6/20 (30%) ei-aed/doac interactions were listed in all eight databases, and even in these six cases, severity rankings were universally discordant. Extreme inconsistencies in interaction reporting (some compendia assigning the highest possible severity ranking, while others reported no interactions) were observed in half of the individually examined interactions (10/20). Drug compendia are highly inconsistent in the inclusion and reported severity of interactions between ei-aeds and doacs. Generation of high-quality, real-world evidence from large-scale outcome studies is imperative to resolve discordance and provide clarity for clinical guidelines.",31517414

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4895,"Statins are widely prescribed drugs with established efficacy in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Although they are mostly well tolerated, several authors have been emphasizing that the statins' safety profile is not totally clarified especially when considering risk of cancer in patients with long-term exposure to statins. This meta-analysis was aimed at evaluating the risk of cancer in patients with prolonged exposure to statins. Medline, cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched in order to identify studies with a minimum average follow-up of 10 years of exposure to statins and a cancer-related outcome reported. Relative risk (rr) of the primary outcomes and the combined effect was presented using a random-effects model. In the selected randomized control trials (rct), statin exposure was compared with placebo, and in the selected observational studies, it was compared with no exposure to statins. We retrieved 1627 studies, of which 15 full-papers were included for final review, five rct, two cohort studies (css), and eight case-control studies (ccs), representing a total of 358 544 patients. Five rct, two cohort studies (css), and eight case-control studies (ccs). No significant differences were found regarding risk of cancer occurrence (rr = 1.08, 0.96-1.21) or cancer mortality (rr = 0.91, 0.80-1.04) due to long-term statin exposure. Regarding all-cause mortality, a protective effect was found (rr = 0.93, 0.90-0.97). According to available and published evidence, statins are not associated with an increased risk of cancer after prolonged exposure. These findings strengthen the role of statins in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.",31509302

In this study, we compare the provincial administrative databases and illustrate the potential impact of database differences on a cnodes study about domperidone and the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (vt/scd). We assessed the impact of varying versions and precision of the international classification of diseases coding system in physician claims data, and the content and completeness of hospital discharge abstracts across cnodes sites, as these variations can introduce differences in the study cohorts formed and affect study results. In our study of 214 962 patients, hospital diagnosis type (such as most responsible, admitting, or secondary diagnosis) was missing in some provinces, resulting in misclassification of the outcome and variation in rates and risk estimates. Incidence rates of vt/scd ranged from 19.8 (95% confidence interval [ci] 17.7-22.2) per 10 000 person-years in british columbia to 53.4 (95% ci 50.3-56.5) in quebec. While most provinces reported an increased risk of vt/scd, a null effect was observed in quebec (rate ratio 1.06; 95% ci 0.79-1.41). Distributed analyses allow for rapid responses to drug safety signals. However, variation in characteristics of the administrative data across research centres can influence study results. By identifying the sources of database heterogeneity, one can evaluate the potential biases these differences may introduce, highlighting the importance of considering such variation in distributed networks.",31507029

We used marketscan commercial claims data (january 2011-june 2018) to identify patients with cml who newly initiated branded imatinib before 1 august 2015 or generic imatinib on or after 2 february 2016, and were continuously enrolled in health plans for 6 months before through 6 months following their initial fill. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, we compared adherence (proportion of days covered [pdc]) and persistence (no gaps ≥30 and ≥60 consecutive days in therapy) to tki therapy. Patients initiating generic imatinib consistently had higher average pdc per month and over the 6-month follow-up period than initiators of branded imatinib. Average 6-month pdc was 92% (95%ci:89%-94%) for generic initiators and 85% (95%ci:83%-86%) for brand initiators. Compared with branded imatinib initiators, a larger proportion of generic imatinib initiators were adherent and persistent to tki therapy (pdc ≥ 90%:78% versus 64%; no≥60-day gap:94% versus 86%). Patients initiating generic imatinib achieved clinically significant improvements in adherence to tki therapy relative to branded drug users, presumably due to lower out-of-pocket costs. Given the importance of optimal adherence in cml, considering barriers to adherence (eg, patient-cost sharing and health benefit design) when selecting initial treatment may improve long-term medication adherence. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies should consider how best to account for expected cost-sharing and its impact on adherence and subsequent clinical outcomes.",31507005

This was a multinational (five european countries) chart review study with two study periods: pre-rmm and post-rmm. Patients initiating ivabradine for chronic stable angina pectoris in routine clinical practice were identified across general practitioners and specialists. The primary outcome analysis evaluated the compliance with the new rmms, ie, use in patients with a heart rate greater than or equal to 70 bpm at initiation, no doses higher than those recommended in the summary of product characteristics (smpc) at initiation and during 6 months of follow-up, and no concomitant use of verapamil or diltiazem. Overall, 711 and 506 eligible patients were included in the pre-rmm and post-rmm periods, respectively. The percentage of patients prescribed ivabradine according to the new rmms increased significantly in the post-rmm period (70.6% and 78.4% in the pre- and post-rmm periods respectively; p value = .0035). The compliance to rmms increased for all the criteria assessed independently: the proportions of patients with (a) heart rate ≥ 70 bpm at initiation (79.4% and 85.2%, respectively; p value = .0141), (b) no dose higher than the smpc doses at initiation and during follow-up (92.8% and 94.1%, respectively; p value = .3957), and (c) no concomitance with verapamil or diltiazem (96.1% and 99.2%, respectively; p value = .0007).

Multiple imputation may help repair bias in these scenarios. However, multiple imputation has not been described for distributed data networks where data access restrictions prevent centralized analysis. We conducted a simulation study and a real-world analysis using the uk's clinical practice research datalink to evaluate multiple imputation for confounders that are systematically missing from a subset of data sites in mock distributed data networks. The simulation study addressed univariate missing data, while the real-world analysis addressed multivariate missing data. Both studies were designed as retrospective cohort studies of the effect of current statin use on the risk of myocardial infarction among patients with newly treated type 2 diabetes. In our simulation study, multiple imputation repaired bias from missing bmi in all scenarios, with a median bias reduction of 118% in the default scenario. In our real-world study, the multiply imputed analysis (hazard ratio [hr]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.69-1.08) was closer to the analysis that considered the true confounder values (hr: 0.85; 95% ci, 0.66-1.10) than the analysis that ignored them (hr: 0.93; 95% ci, 0.73-1.20).

The purpose of this study was to use medical chart review to clinically validate a claims-based algorithm to identify serious opioid overdose events. The algorithm for serious opioid overdose required an opioid poisoning or external cause icd-9-cm code occurring within 1 day of (a) an adverse effect code for serious central nervous system or respiratory depression or (b) a mechanical ventilation or critical care cpt code. The claims coding algorithm identified a sample of 145 individuals 18 years or older among patients that presented to the emergency department of two large hospitals in metropolitan atlanta, georgia from january 2014 to august 2015. Claims-defined cases were evaluated against rigorous clinical definitions for serious opioid overdose using (a) literature-based criteria for typical clinical manifestations of opioid overdose and/or (b) clinical response to the opioid-specific reversal agent naloxone. The positive predictive value (ppv) for a serious opioid overdose was calculated as the percentage of clinically confirmed cases (definite or probable). Among 140 evaluable claims-defined cases, 107 fulfilled clinical criteria for a serious opioid overdose [95 definite and 12 probable; ppv of 76.4% (95% ci 69.4%, 83.5%)].

Brintellix is indicated for major depressive disorder; brilinta is indicated to reduce cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome or history of myocardial infarction. Brintellix was renamed to trintellix in may 2016. Using brilinta and brintellix as a proof-of-concept feasibility use case, we assessed whether drug name confusion errors between the pair could be identified in electronic health care data via the combination of a claims-based algorithm and limited manual claims data review. Using data from the sentinel system, we defined potential errors as brintellix users without an on- or off-label indication for brintellix, without a dispensing for a drug with the same indications as brintellix, and with an on- or off-label indication for brilinta between -365 and +30 days after index brintellix dispensing; the reverse was done for brilinta. We manually reviewed claims profiles of potential cases. We identified 27 (0.1%) potential errors among 21 208 brintellix users; 16 appeared to be likely errors based on claims profile review. Fifty-one (0.3%) of the 16 779 brilinta users were identified as potential errors, and four appeared to be likely errors.

New users of two drugs and monotherapy were matched 1:2 by propensity score. Main exposure was ""as-treated,"" ie, until first regimen change. Primary and secondary endpoints were systolic and diastolic bp control and major adverse cardiovascular event (mace), respectively. Hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) were estimated using cox proportional hazard models. Of 54 523 eligible patients, 3256 (6.0%) were initiated to a two-drug combination. Of these, 2807 were matched to 5614 monotherapy users. Mean exposure duration was 12.7 months, with 76.5% patients changing their initial regimen. Two-drug therapy was associated with a clinically significant bp control increase in all hypertensive patients (hr = 1.17 [95%ci: 1.09-1.26]), more so in patients with grade 2-3 hypertension (hr = 1.28 [1.17-1.41]). An increase of 27% in bp control (hr = 1.27 [1.08-1.49]) was observed in patients initiating an acei+ccb combination compared with initiators of either single class.

Prescriptions rates were calculated for all prescriptions by class and described over time. Across provinces, we identified 650 830 patients who initiated antidiabetic medications during the study period. In most provinces, the overall prescription rate of antidiabetic medications increased during the last two decades. Metformin particularly increased in popularity, surpassing sulfonylureas in all provinces as the most widely prescribed antidiabetic medication by the early 2000s. Thiazolidinediones grew in popularity from the onset of their availability until 2006 to 2007, at which point they rapidly declined. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors saw substantial growth in several provinces following their addition to provincial formularies in 2008 to 2012, while glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists experienced modest growth.

Using both inpatient and outpatient medication data to define the gold standard exposure definition, we assessed 10 different analytical methods in which exposure was defined using outpatient medication data only. We compared different methodological approaches to reduce immeasurable time bias: restricting to nonhospitalized patients, adjusting for hospitalization, weighting by either measurable time (nonhospitalized time during 90-d period) or outpatient time, and computing the odds ratios (ors) using 90-day cumulative probability of exposure produced by the kaplan-meier product-limit estimator for cases and controls.

Increased risk for tramadol was consistently present when the adverse events were restricted to those with neurologic-respiratory depression/other symptoms of possible overdose. In adolescents without cancer or other severe conditions prescribed short-acting opioids, the incidence of both all opioid-related adverse events and more serious events with opioid-related escalation of care, hospitalization, or death was consistently greater for tramadol than for hydrocodone.",31418512

Early identification of total hip arthroplasty devices with increased risk of failure can be challenging because devices consist of multiple components, hundreds of distinct components are currently used in surgery, and any estimated effect needs to address confounding due to device and patient factors. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of machine learning approaches at identifying recalled components listed by the us food and drug administration using data from a us total joint arthroplasty registry. An open cohort study was conducted using data (january 1, 2001, to december 31, 2015) from 74 520 implantations and 348 unique components in the kaiser permanente total joint replacement registry. Exposures of interest were device components used in elective primary total hip arthroplasty. The outcome was time to first revision surgery, defined as exchange, removal, or addition of any component. Machine learning methods included regularized/unregularized cox models and random survival forest. Among the recalled components detected were asr acetabular shell/large femoral head, durom acetabular shell/metasul large femoral head, and rejuvenate modular neck stem. The three components not identified were characterized by small numbers of devices recorded in the registry. The novel approaches to signal detection may improve postmarket surveillance of frequently used arthroplasty devices, which in turn will improve public health.",31418506

Previous work has demonstrated that patients may complete pro assessments less frequently in the control arm compared with the experimental arm in open-label trials. Such differential completion may affect pro results. This paper sought to explore principal stratification methodology to address potential bias caused by the posttreatment intermediate variable of questionnaire completion. We evaluated six randomized trials (five open-label and one double-blind) of anticancer therapies with varying levels of pro completion submitted to the food and drug administration (fda). We applied complete case analysis (cca), multiple imputation (mi), and principal stratification to evaluate pro results for quality of life (qol) and the domains of physical, role, and emotional function (pf, rf, and ef). Assignment to potential principal strata was by the expectation maximization algorithm using patient baseline characteristics. Completion rates in the experimental arm ranged from 66% to 94% and 51% to 95% in the control arm. Four trials had negligible completion differences between arms (1%-2%), and two had large differences favoring the experimental arm (15%-17%). For trials with negligible completion differences, principal stratification results were similar to cca and mi results for all domains. Notable differences in point estimates may be observed in trials with large differences in completion rates. However, in the examined trials, the confidence intervals for the principal stratification estimates overlapped with the ones obtained using cca. The principal stratification estimand may be a useful additional analysis, especially if pro completion differs between arms.",31410963

We applied sentinel system analytic tools on the electronic health records of kaiser permanente, northern california, january 1, 2010, through may 30, 2015,to identify rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients with new use of methotrexate (365-day baseline period). We identified potential methotrexate frequency errors using icd-9 code 995.20 (adverse drug event), current procedural terminology (cpt) code 96409 for injection of leucovorin and prescription refill patterns. We performed chart review to confirm the frequency errors, assessed performance for detecting frequency errors, and estimated the incidence of chart-confirmed errors. The study included 24,529 methotrexate dispensings among 3,668 ra patients. Among these, 722 (3%) had one dispensing and 23,807 (97.1%) had ≥2 dispensings during 1-year follow-up period. We flagged 653 (2.7%) with a potential medication error (46 with one dispensing and 607 with ≥2 dispensings). We sampled 94 for chart review, and confirmed three methotrexate errors. All three confirmed frequency errors involved a first methotrexate dispensing followed by injected rescue therapy, leucovorin, (positive predictive value, 60%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 15-95%). No potential errors were found among patients with ≥2 dispensings. We estimated the frequency error incidence among one methotrexate dispensing to be 0.4% (95%ci, 0.1% to 1.2%). Rescue therapy is a specific indicator of methotrexate overdose among first methotrexate dispensings. This method is generalizable to other medications with serious adverse events treated with antidotes.",31410932

Self-reported medication use was obtained from the population-based survey health and environment in oslo (helmilo) (2009-2010) (n = 13 019). Data on dispensed hypnotics and anxiolytics were obtained from the norwegian prescription database (norpd). As measures of validity, we calculated sensitivity and specificity using both self-reports and prescription records as the reference standard. Furthermore, we calculated cohen's kappa. Current self-reported medication use was compared with prescription data in time windows of both 100 and 200 days preceding questionnaire completion. The highest sensitivity was observed for current sleep medication use in the 100-day time window (sensitivity = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.74, 0.79) when using prescription records as the reference standard. Sensitivity was generally lower for tranquilizers compared with sleep medications. Cohen's kappa showed the highest agreement for the 200-day time window with substantial agreement for sleep medications (kappa = 0.64; 95% ci: 0.62, 0.67) and moderate agreement for tranquilizers (kappa = 0.45; 95% ci: 0.41, 0.48). The present study suggests moderate to substantial agreement between self-reported use of sleep medications and tranquilizers and dispensed drugs in a general adult population. The magnitude of agreement varied according to drug category and time window. Since self-reported and registry-based use of these drug classes does not match each other accurately, limitations of each data source should be considered when such medications are applied as the exposure or outcome in epidemiologic studies.",31407838

Npds, which collects data on all calls to us poison control centers, and drug-involved mortality (dim), which combines information from literal text of us death certificates and national vital statistics systems, were queried for opioid-involved fatal cases from 2010 to 2015. Characteristics of the two case series were compared. Dim contained 154 016 opioid-involved overdose deaths, and npds contained 2524 fatal opioid exposures, a ratio of 61:1. The number of opioid deaths remained stable in npds but increased in dim over the 6-year period. On average, deaths involving opioids with higher mean dosage strength (in morphine milligram equivalents) per unit among dispensed prescriptions were more likely to be captured in dim relative to npds, as compared with those with a lower mean dosage strength per unit. The increase in fentanyl-related deaths seen in dim since 2013 was not observed in npds. Npds is a valuable drug safety surveillance resource due to its timeliness and drug specificity. However, it captures only a small fraction of opioid-involved fatal poisonings, and comparisons with data derived from death certificate literal text indicate that caution is warranted in making inferences about opioid-involved fatality trends over time or comparisons across opioids.",31402548

We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the urban employee basic medical insurance database (2011-2014) in beijing. We identified 475 patients with newly diagnosed bone metastatic prostate cancer with at least one prescription for hormone therapy and described their treatment patterns over a median follow-up of 20.7 months. Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare time to chemotherapy initiation between patients starting on different hormone therapies. Hormone therapy and/or bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid were the initial treatments in the majority of patients (87.8%); chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery were usually given later in the treatment pathway. Cab was the most common hormone treatment (73.7%). For time to chemotherapy initiation, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 2.43 (1.08-5.44) for nsaa alone vs cab and 1.29 (0.78-2.13) for castration alone vs cab. Our findings show that while a wide range of therapies are used to treat patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis in beijing, hormone therapy and bisphosphonate therapy are the most commonly prescribed, and use of cab was seen to be advantageous in delaying time to chemotherapy initiation over nsaa monotherapy. Future studies should explore longer-term treatment patterns, including use of newly approved treatments.",31397051

These methods can be categorized by complexity and precision level. Co-occurrence-based ml methods are rather basic, as they identify simultaneous appearance of drugs and clinical events in a single post. In contrast, statistical learning methods involve more complex nlp and identify drugs, events, and associations between them. We aimed to compare the ability of co-occurrence and nlp to identify aes and signals of disproportionate reporting (sdr) in patient-generated sm. We also examined the performance of lift in sm-based signal detection (sd). Our examination was performed in a corpus of sm posts crawled from open online patient forums and communities, using the spontaneously reported vigibase data as reference data set. We found that co-occurrence and nlp produce aes, which are 57% and 93% consistent with vigibase aes, respectively. Among the sdrs identified both in sm and in vigibase, up to 55.3% were identified earlier in co-occurrence, and up to 32.1% were identified earlier in nlp-processed sm. Using lift in sm sd provided performance similar to frequentist methods, both in co-occurrence and in nlp-processed aes. Our results indicate that using sm as a data source complementary to traditional pharmacovigilance sources should be considered further. Various levels of sm processing may be considered, depending on the preferred policies and tolerance for false-positive to false-negative balance in routine pharmacovigilance processes.",31392844

The source population included all deceased patients aged 18 to 64 years with medicaid enrollment in the 6 months prior to death. To identify sudden cardiac deaths, algorithm 1 used only hospital/emergency department (ed) claims from encounters at the time of death, and algorithm 2 required death certificates and used claims data for specific exclusion criteria.

We conducted a dynamic cohort study using medication administration data from 68 residential aged care facilities (racfs) during 2014 to 2017. Descriptive statistics and regression were used to estimate the proportion of residents who used nsaids, nsaids long term, nsaids with ppis, and the triple whammy combination. Ten thousand three hundred sixty-seven residents were included. Two thousand four hundred fourteen (23.3%) used at least one nsaid: 756 (7.3%) used only oral, 1326 (12.8%) used only topical, and 332 (3.2%) used both topical and oral nsaids. One thousand five hundred forty two (14.8%) used an nsaid long term, a majority of which only used topical nsaids 933/1542 (60.5%). Age, sex, and health status were associated with greater variation in long-term topical use relative to oral nsaid use.

We analyzed two data sources from the salford lung study in copd: trial ecrf and the salford integrated record, a linked primary-secondary routine care ehr database of all patients in salford. For trial participants, aecopd episodes reported in ecrf were compared with algorithmically derived moderate/severe aecopd episodes identified in ehr. Episode characteristics (frequency, duration), sensitivity, and positive predictive value (ppv) were calculated. A match between ecrf and ehr episodes was defined as at least 1-day overlap. In the primary effectiveness analysis population (n = 2269), 3791 ehr episodes (mean [sd] length: 15.1 [3.59] days; range: 14-54) and 4403 moderate/severe aecopd ecrf episodes (mean length: 13.8 [16.20] days; range: 1-372) were identified. Ecrf episodes exceeding 28 days were usually broken up into shorter episodes in the ehr. Sensitivity was 63.6% and ppv 71.1%, where concordance was defined as at least 1-day overlap. The ehr algorithm performance was acceptable, indicating that ehr-derived aecopd episodes may provide an efficient, valid method of data collection. Comparing ehr-derived aecopd episodes with those collected by ecrf resulted in slightly fewer episodes, and ecrf episodes of extreme lengths were poorly captured in ehr. Analysis of routinely collected ehr data may be reasonable when relative, rather than absolute, rates of aecopd are relevant for stakeholders' decision making.",31385428

Three alternative approaches, derived from different perspectives, implement restriction by trimming observations in the tails of the propensity score (ps). Across approaches, we compared the relationships between the overlap in treatment-specific ps distributions and the size of the balanced study population after trimming. The three trimming approaches considered were absolute trimming to the range 0.1<ps<0.9, asymmetric trimming to include subjects in both treatment groups with ps above the 5th percentile of the distribution in the target group and below the 95th percentile in the comparison group, and restriction to preference score values between 0.3 and 0.7. Comparisons of approaches used simulated pss from beta distributions and two example studies. The magnitude of the c-statistic strongly predicted (r  ≥.95) the percent of the balanced study population remaining. The balanced study population was largest under trimming at absolute ps levels, unless the target treatment was uncommon. Fewer than half of original study subjects remained after preference score trimming if c≥.80 and after asymmetric trimming if c≥.85. In examples, trimming improved the precision of estimated risk differences and identified apparent treatment effect heterogeneity in the ps tails where covariate balance was limited. Relative amounts of trimming in examples reflected the simulation results. Study populations with high ps c-statistics include only small percentages of subjects in whom valid treatment effects are confidently expected.",31385394

This study aimed to investigate the impact of different exposure definitions on the association between amiodarone use and the risk of acute pancreatitis. Using data from the dutch pharmo database network, incident amiodarone users were compared to incident users of a different type of antiarrhythmic drug. Eighteen different definitions were applied to define amiodarone exposure, including dichotomized, continuous and categorized cumulative definitions with lagged effects to account for the half-life of amiodarone. For each exposure definition, a cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (hr) of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. This study included 15,378 starters of amiodarone and 21,394 starters of other antiarrhythmic drugs. Adjusted hrs for acute pancreatitis ranged between 1.21-1.43 for dichotomized definitions of exposure to amiodarone, between 1.13-1.22 for dose definitions (per ddd) and between 0.52-1.72 for cumulative dose definitions, depending on the category. Accounting for lagged effects had little impact on estimated hrs. This study demonstrates the relative insensitivity of the association between amiodarone and the risk of acute pancreatitis against a broad range of different exposure definitions. Accounting for possible lagged effects had little impact, possibly because treatment switching and discontinuation was uncommon in this population.",31373736

Two algorithms from the pass were applied to extract potential cases from the hospital information system: specific end point (a) (discharge diagnosis of liver disease-specific codes) and less specific end point (b) (discharge and outpatient-specific and nonspecific codes suggestive of liver injury). Ali cases were confirmed on the basis of plasma liver enzyme activity elevation. Secondary analysis was performed following exclusion of cases with known cancer, chronic liver, biliary and pancreatic disease, heart failure, and alcohol-related disorders, as applied in the pass. On the basis of icd codes: outcome a, 154 cases (143 with case notes and lab data for case verification); outcome b, 485 cases (357 with case notes and lab data).

The completeness and accuracy of pin were respectively calculated as the percentage of abc records coexisting (concordant) in pin and the percentage of concordant records having mutually agreeable information on drug quantity. Generalized linear models were used to examine potential association of pin completeness and accuracy with sociodemographic factors. A total of 1 218 191 drug prescription records from 13 143 atp participants were captured by pin and abc in 2008-2015, among which 91.6% were from pin, 82.5% from abc, and 74.2% coexisted in pin and abc.

Exposure to nitrosatable drugs has been associated with congenital malformations and preterm birth, but use during pregnancy as a cause of fetal death is not well-known. We examined if prenatally nitrosatable drug use is associated with risk of stillbirth. A nationwide cohort was conducted using 554 844 women with singleton and first recorded pregnancies regardless of previous pregnancy history from the danish medical birth register from 1996 to 2015. Exposure was recorded by use of the danish national prescription register and defined as women who had redeemed a prescribed nitrosatable drug in the first 22 weeks of pregnancy. The reference group was women with no redeemed prescribed nitrosatable drug in this time period. We categorized nitrosatable drugs as secondary amines, tertiary amines, and amides. Cox hazard regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (ahrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for stillbirth. Among the 84 720 exposed women, 348 had a stillbirth compared with 1690 stillbirths among the 470 124 unexposed women.

A cross-sectional study was performed at the outpatient obstetrics clinics of the university hospital leuven, belgium between november 2016 and march 2017. All pregnant women 18 years and older and understanding dutch, french, or english were asked to participate in an online survey. In total, 379 pregnant women participated. Prevalence of medication use during the preceding week was 52%. Paracetamol (14%), levothyroxine (13%), and antacids (9%) were the most frequently used medicines. Pregnancy vitamins were used by 86% of women, and 97% had used a pregnancy vitamin somewhere during pregnancy. Only 56% initiated folic acid supplementation at least 1 month before pregnancy. Preconception use of folic acid among women following assisted reproductive technology was 73%. Inappropriate use of health products was observed among 3% of women. Prevalence of alcohol use and/or smoking during the preceding week was 6%. Alcohol and smoking cessation mainly occurred after pregnancy diagnosis. Pregnant women living in belgium frequently use medicines, pregnancy vitamins, and other health products. Preconception lifestyle changes such as folic acid intake and alcohol and smoking cessation are poorly implemented. Public campaigns and interventions are needed to improve preconception care and counselling.",31342605

We then evaluated the adherence of these prescriptions to the european society of cardiology (esc) guideline-recommended medications and identified patient characteristics associated with nonadherence. We used data from the epical2 cohort study. Hfref patients who had completed prescriptions at discharge and at 6-month follow-up were included and followed for 36 months. The following medication agents were considered adherent to guidelines: renin-angiotensin system (ras) blockers [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (acei) or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (arb)] plus a β-blocker (bb) or ras blocker plus bb plus mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (mras). The evolution of drug prescriptions and the adherence to esc guidelines were assessed by using sequence analysis and clustering approaches. Patient characteristics associated with nonadherence were identified by logistic regression analyses. A typology of four therapeutic clusters was obtained, among which two clusters were adherent to recommendations and two were not. The adherent clusters consisted of bitherapy (ras blockers-bb) and tritherapy (ras blockers-bb-mra) for about 64% of patients and remain stable over time. The nonadherent clusters consisted of nonprescription of bb for about 22% of patients or nonprescription of ras blocker for about 14%. The main reason for nonprescription of bb was a concomitant obstructive airway disease (asthma or copd) but was a concomitant chronic kidney disease for nonprescription of ras blocker. Adherence to guideline-recommended medications while being hospitalized is of great importance because prescriptions are quite stable over time after discharge. Hfref patients are most often older, with various comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease or asthma/copd, which importantly limit physicians' ability to prescribe recommended drugs, leading to suboptimal adherence to guidelines.",31339629

We conducted a nationwide cohort study involving 2 716 000 diabetes patients in japan. New users of any antidiabetic drug as monotherapy between 1 april 2010 and 31 october 2014 were identified. Occurrences of myocardial infarction (mi), heart failure (hf), and stroke requiring hospitalization associated with dpp-4is were compared with those associated with biguanides (bgs), sulfonylureas (sus), or α-glucosidase inhibitors (α-gis). Adjusted hazard ratios (ahrs) for these outcomes were estimated by cox proportional hazards model. Propensity score standardization was used to control for confounding. We identified 1 105 103 patients using dpp-4is, 278 280 patients using bgs, 273 449 patients using sus, and 217 026 patients using α-gis. The risks of mi and hf for dpp-4i users were significantly higher than those for bg users (mi: ahr, 1.48 [95%ci, 1.20-1.82], hf: ahr, 1.46 [95%ci, 1.31-1.62]), while significantly lower than those for su users (mi: ahr, 0.84 [95%ci, 0.72-0.98], hf: ahr, 0.86 [95%ci, 0.81-0.92]).

A multicentre, prospective cohort study recruited 1280 patients (median age 82 years) at hospital discharge. Patients were followed-up in the community by pharmacists for 8 weeks to identify mrh (harm from adverse drug reactions, non-adherence, and medication errors) and hospital admissions. One-year mortality was determined using hospital records. Potentially inappropriate medications (pims) were determined using the 2015 version of the beers criteria. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between patients prescribed pims and adverse outcomes. Two hundred and seventy-six patients (22%) were prescribed one or more pims at hospital discharge. The main pim classes prescribed at hospital discharge were benzodiazepines and related drugs (30%) and antidepressants (27%). 1116 out of 1280 patients completed follow-up and 413 (37%) experienced mrh. In 51 cases (12%), mrh was attributable to a pim. There was no significant relationship between patients prescribed pims and overall mrh, hospital readmission or all-cause one-year mortality. Multiple pims at discharge was independently associated with an increased risk of adr (or 2.32, 95% ci 1.03-5.23). The prescribing of pims is common at hospital discharge of older adults in england. The 2015 beers criteria have a limited clinical value to predict adverse outcomes following hospital discharge in this setting.",31338909

This study aimed to assess the effect of lda use on overall cancer incidence among the french population. We conducted a 10-year historical cohort study using the permanent sample of the french national health care databases: the système national des données de santé (snds). We used data for 111 025 individuals aged 50 to 80 years at study entry (january 1, 2006) without prevalent cancer or lda use. Individuals were followed until the earliest of cancer incidence, death from any cause, exit from the database, or end of the study on december 31, 2015. We estimated the effect of lda on cancer incidence by using a dynamic model to account for the competing risk of death in the presence of time-dependent exposure and risk factors. Lda use was associated with reduced 10-year risk of cancer (subdistribution hazard ratio [shr] 0.81 [95% ci 0.77-0.86]). The shrs were 0.88 [0.82-0.94] for men and 0.93 [0.85-1.02] for women. Moreover, each additional year of lda use was associated with reduced 10-year risk of cancer (shr 0.93 [0.92-0.95]). Lda use was also associated with reduced 10-year risk of death (shr 0.86 [0.82-0.91]).

We used data from the national disease and therapeutic index to evaluate medications prescribed to children (definition: aged 19 years or younger) and adults (20 years or older) with scd by office-based physicians in the united states during 1997 to 2017. Prescriptions were evaluated in 3-year intervals. The proportion of scd visits that included new/continued hydroxyurea prescriptions increased from less than or equal to 8% before 2009 to 33% in 2015 to 2017. The increase was significant in visits by children (2.5% in 1997-1999 to 47% in 2015-2017; p = .003 by spearman's rank-order correlation) but not in adults (6.9% to 11%; p = .12). Opioids, started/continued in 13% (lowest 3-year average) to 35% (highest) of visits by children and 55% to 81% of visits by adults, remained the most frequently prescribed medications for scd overall. There were no significant changes over time in opioid prescribing for adults (p = .64) or children (p = .38). Hematologists/oncologists accounted for a higher proportion of visits by children (67.2% over 1997-2017) than adults (25.2%), while emergency medicine visits were higher in adults (14.0%) than children (2.6%). This study suggests a robust increase in hydroxyurea prescribing for children with scd. The baby hug trial, which demonstrated safety and efficacy of starting hydroxyurea in infancy and informed current scd guidelines recommending broader use in children, may have contributed to this increase. However, hydroxyurea prescribing for adults remains infrequent and considerably lower than opioids. Barriers in access to specialist care persist for adults with scd.",31328369

We determined the proportion of hospitalizations in cprd that were also recorded in hospital episode statistics (hes), and vice versa, among patients initiating oral antidiabetic (oad) therapy. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from october 2009 to september 2012 among oad-treated patients registered with general practitioners who contribute to cprd and consent to hes linkage. In cprd, we identified initial hospitalizations for each calendar year by an inpatient referral, consultation type code, or read code indicating an inpatient episode and determined if an admission date was recorded in hes within ±30 days. We then identified initial hes admission dates and determined if a hospitalization was documented in cprd within ±30 days. Sensitivity analyses were conducted utilizing hes discharge, rather than admission, dates. Among 8574 oad-treated hes-linked patients in cprd, 6574 initial hospitalizations across the study period were identified in cprd, and 5188 (78.9% [95% ci, 77.9%-79.9%]) were confirmed by a hes admission date within ±30 days (median difference, ±3 days [iqr, 1-7 days]).

Using the 2011 to 2015 truven health marketscan database, we identified pregnancies, including losses and terminations. In a cohort design, nonpregnant women filling a prescription for isotretinoin or tretinoin were matched to five women without either prescription. Women were followed for 365 days or until conception, medication discontinuation, or enrollment discontinuation (""prescription episode""). Rates of pregnancy, risks of pregnancy losses, and prevalence of infant malformations at birth were assessed by exposure. We identified 2 179 192 livebirths, 8434 stillbirths, 2521 mixed births, 415 110 spontaneous abortions, 124 556 elective terminations, and 8974 unspecified abortions. There were 86 834 isotretinoin and 973 587 tretinoin episodes, matched to 5 302 105 unexposed women. Pregnancy rates were 3 (isotretinoin), 19 (tretinoin), and 34 (unexposed) per 1000 person-years. Risk of spontaneous pregnancy losses were similar; however, terminations were more common in the isotretinoin-exposed (28% [95% ci: 21%-36%]) than the tretinoin-exposed (10% [95% ci: 9%-11%]) or unexposed pregnancies (6%). Malformations occurred in 4.5% (95% ci: 3.5%-5.6%) of the tretinoin-exposed pregnancies and 4.2% of the unexposed pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio: 1.16 [95% ci: 0.85-1.58]); isotretinoin-exposed births were too few to assess malformations. Administrative databases can complement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (rems) for known teratogens and contribute to safety surveillance for other medications. Here, isotretinoin-exposed pregnancy rates were low, but existent, and many pregnancies were terminated. Tretinoin exposure was not associated with a meaningfully elevated risk of losses or malformations as compared with unexposed pregnancies.",31328328

We conducted a retrospective concept-wide association study (cwas) using clinical notes to identify potential risk factors for medication nonadherence, adjusting for age, sex, race, baseline blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and a combined comorbidity score. Participants included medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older receiving care at the harvard vanguard medical associates network from 2010-2012 and enrolled in a medicare advantage program. Concepts were extracted from clinical notes in the year prior to the index prescription date for each patient. We tested associations with the outcome for 5013 concepts extracted from clinical notes in a derivation cohort (4382 patients) and accounted for multiple hypothesis testing by using a false discovery rate threshold of less than 5% (q < .05). We then confirmed the associations in a validation cohort (3836 patients). Medication nonadherence was defined using a proportion of days covered (pdc) threshold less than 0.8 using pharmacy claims data. We found 415 concepts associated with nonadherence, which we organized into 11 clusters using a hierarchical clustering approach. Volume depletion and overload, assessment of needs at the point of discharge, mood disorders, neurological disorders, complex coordination of care, and documentation of noncompliance were some of the factors associated with nonadherence. This approach was successful in identifying previously described and potentially new risk factors for antihypertensive nonadherence using the clinical narrative.",31313427

We identified patients newly prescribed fourth-line anti-hypertensive drugs (aldosterone antagonist , beta-blocker, or alpha-blocker). Using propensity score-adjusted cox proportional hazards models, we compared the incidence of the primary outcome (composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction) between patients on different fourth-line drugs. Aa was the reference drug in all comparisons. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome, blood pressure changes, and heart failure. We used a negative control outcome, herpes zoster, to detect unmeasured confounding. Overall, 8639 patients were included. In propensity score-adjusted analyses, the hazard ratio for the primary outcome was 0.81 (95% ci, 0.55-1.19) for beta-blockers and 0.68 (95% ci, 0.46-0.96) for alpha-blockers versus aa. Findings for individual cardiovascular outcomes trended in a more plausible direction, albeit imprecise. A trend for a protective effect for herpes zoster across both comparisons was seen. A higher rate of all-cause death in the aa group was likely due to unmeasured confounding in our analysis of the composite primary outcome, supported by our negative outcome analysis. Results for cardiovascular outcomes were plausible, but imprecise due to small cohort sizes and a low number of observed outcomes.",31313390

Women with an antidepressant fill during pregnancy were categorized as ""continuers"" (n = 1634); those without a fill were ""discontinuers"" (n = 1211). We calculated relative risks (rrs) for gdm and mean differences in screening blood glucose levels using generalized estimating equations with inverse probability of treatment weighting to account for baseline characteristics, including mental health conditions and indicators of mental health severity. Compared with discontinuers, antidepressant continuers had comparable risk of gdm (rr: 1.10; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.84-1.44) and blood glucose levels (mean difference: 2.3 mg/dl; 95% ci, -1.5 to 6.1 mg/dl).

We identified all mother-infant pairs in fl and tx birth certificates records (bcr) that could be linked individually to max records (1999-2005 for fl and 1999-2010 for tx) based on social security number (gold standard pairs). Case id linkage performance was evaluated as the proportion of gold standard mother-infant pairs that were identified by the algorithm (sensitivity) and the proportion of algorithm defined mother-infant pairs that were correctly linked. Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate the probability for successful case id algorithm linkage versus non-linkage using maternal and infant characteristics. We identified 323,160 gold standard pairs in fl bcr and max and 1,025,350 in tx bcr and max.

A register-based cohort study including all children (n = 50 546) born in stockholm, sweden 2006 to 2007, followed up during 2006 to 2014. Exposure was sibling status; outcome was incidence of dispensed asthma medication and persistence over time. A cox model was used to study the association between sibship and asthma medication. Persistence was defined using two different time windows (4 and 18 months) in a refill sequence model including siblings' and unrelated control children's medication. After 1 year of age, the adjusted hazard ratio of dispensed asthma medication was 0.85 (95% ci 0.80-0.90) among children with siblings compared with singletons. The estimated proportion of children with persistent controller medication was 7.2% (4-month model) and 64.5% (18-month model). When including the siblings' controller medication, the estimated proportion was 8.8% (4 months) and 7.8% for control children (relative risk (rr) 0.89, 95% ci 0.81-0.98). The persistence was lower for those with siblings compared with singletons (adj. Rr 0.72, 95% ci 0.62-0.85 for 4 months) with similar estimates for older, younger, and full siblings and regardless of asthma diagnoses. Siblings have different dispensing patterns of asthma medications compared with singletons regardless of asthma diagnoses. After including the siblings' asthma medication and compared with control children, the proportion of children with persistent medication increased which may indicate that siblings share asthma medications.",31271484

Longitudinal population-based study using interrupted time series methods. British columbia outpatient claims data for individuals aged 65 and older were used to compute monthly ad visit rates and examine the impact of the chei reimbursement policy on the coding of ad. We examined trends in the number of patients with ad visits, the number of ad visits per patient, and visits with ""competing"" diagnoses (mental, neurological, and cerebrovascular disorders and accidental falls). Finally, we described demographic and clinical features of diagnosed patients. We analyzed 1.9 million ad visits. Faster growth in recorded ad visits was observed after the policy was implemented, from monthly growth of 7.5 visits per 100 000 person-months before the policy (95% confidence interval [ci], 6.1-8.9) to monthly growth of 16.5 per 100 000 person-months after the policy (95% ci, 14.8-18.3). After the implementation of the policy, we observed increased growth in the number of patients with recorded ad visits and the number of ad visits per patient, as well as a shift in diagnoses away from mental diseases and accidental falls to ad (diagnosis substitution). British columbia's reimbursement policy for cheis was associated with a significant acceleration in alzheimer's visits. Evaluations of health services utilization and clinical outcomes following drug policy changes need to consider policy-induced influences on the reliability of the data used in the analysis.",31267629

We evaluated the early impact of this intervention. We conducted a matched controlled, before-and-after quasi-experimental study within the french health insurance database (système national des données de santé [snds]). The sa program was implemented in a set of 18 départements in france and targeted 18- to 44-year-old subjects, with at least two reimbursement dates for asthma drug therapy during the 12-month period prior to program targeting. Change in outcomes was assessed from the ""before program"" period (january-december 2014) to the ""after program implementation"" period (march 2015-february 2016) in the program group (eligible to sa program in the 18 départements) and in the matched controlled group. The main outcome measure was the before-after change in proportion of subjects with a controllers/(controllers+relievers) ratio greater than 50%. Of the 99 578 subjects of the program group, 9225 (9.3%) actually participated in sa program. The program had no significant impact on the proportion of subjects with a ratio greater than 50%.

In the 2017 to 2018 season, we transitioned our near real-time surveillance in medicare to more effectively detect large gbs risk increases early in the season while avoiding false positives. We conducted a simulation study examining the ability of the updating sequential probability ratio test (usprt) to detect substantially elevated gbs risk in the 8- to 21-day postvaccination versus 5× to 30× the historical rate. We varied the first testing week (weeks 5-8) and the null rate (1×-3×) and evaluated power. We estimated signal probability and the risk ratio (rr) after signaling when high-risk seasons were rare. Applying fixed alternatives, we found >80% power to detect a risk 30× the historical rate in week 5 for the 1× null and in week 6 for the 1.5× to 3× nulls. Nearly all testing schedules had >80% power for a 5× risk by week 11. To test the robustness of usprt, we further simulated seasons where 1% were true high-risk seasons. Using a 1× null led to 10% of seasons signaling by week 11 (median rr approximately 1.4), which decreased to approximately 1% with the ≥2.5× null (median rr approximately 16.0). On the basis of the results from this simulation and subsequent consultations with experts and stakeholders, we specified usprt to test continuously from weeks 7 to 11 using the null hypothesis that the observed gbs rate was 2.5× the historical rate. This helped improve the ability of usprt to provide early detection of gbs risk following influenza vaccination as part of a multilayered system of surveillance.",31222967

This study was conducted to (a) assess effectiveness of these measures on codeine prescribing in the ""real-world"" setting and (b) test feasibility of a study using a common protocol by regulators with access to databases. The study was performed using bifap (spain), cprd (uk), and ims® disease analyzer (france and germany) databases. Prescribers included general practitioners (gps) (france and uk), gps and paediatricians together (spain), and gps, paediatricians, and ear, nose, and throat (ent) specialists separately (germany). Between january 2010 and june 2015, prevalence of codeine prescribing was obtained every 6 months, and a time series analysis (joinpoint) was performed. Codeine prescribing within ±30 days of ta was also identified. Furthermore, doses, durations, and prior prescribing of other analgesics were investigated. Over the 5-year period, codeine prescribing decreased in children younger than 12 years (by 84% in france and spain, 44% in gp practices in germany, and 33% in the united kingdom). The temporal pattern was compatible with the regulatory intervention in france and the united kingdom, whereas a decrease throughout the study period was seen in germany and spain. Decreased prescribing associated with ta was suggested in ent practices in germany. Codeine prescribing for children decreased in line with introduced regulatory measures.

We developed a natural language processing (nlp) software application to code clinical text documentation of overdose, including identification of intention for self-harm, substances involved, substance abuse, and error in medication usage. Using datasets balanced with cases of suspected overdose and records of individuals at elevated risk for overdose, we developed and validated the application using kaiser permanente northwest data, then tested portability of the application using kaiser permanente washington data. Datasets were chart-reviewed to provide a gold standard for comparison and evaluation of the automated method. The method performed well in identifying overdose (sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.93), intentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.98), and involvement of opioids (excluding heroin, sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.96) and heroin (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 1.0). The method performed poorly at identifying adverse drug reactions and overdose due to patient error and fairly at identifying substance abuse in opioid-related unintentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.96). Evaluation using validation datasets yielded significant reductions, in specificity and negative predictive values only, for many classifications mentioned above. However, these measures remained above 0.80, thus, performance observed during development was largely maintained during validation. Similar results were obtained when evaluating portability, although there was a significant reduction in sensitivity for unintentional overdose that was attributed to missing text clinical notes in the database. Methods that process text clinical notes show promise for improving accuracy and fidelity at identifying and classifying overdoses according to type using ehr data.",31218780

However, ascertaining pregnancies, their timing, and outcomes in these data is challenging. While individual studies have adopted different methods, no systematic approach to characterise all pregnancies in a primary care database has yet been published. Therefore, we developed a new algorithm to establish a pregnancy register in the uk clinical practice research datalink (cprd) gold primary care database. We compiled over 4000 read and entity codes to identify pregnancy-related records among women aged 11 to 49 years in cprd gold. Codes were categorised by the stage or outcome of pregnancy to facilitate delineation of pregnancy episodes. We constructed hierarchical rule systems to handle information from multiple sources. We assessed the validity of the register to identify pregnancy outcomes by comparing our results to linked hospitalisation records and office for national statistics population rates. Our algorithm identified 5.8 million pregnancies among 2.4 million women (january 1987-february 2018). We observed close agreement with hospitalisation data regarding completeness of pregnancy outcomes (91% sensitivity for deliveries and 77% for pregnancy losses) and their timing (median 0 days difference, interquartile range 0-2 days). Miscarriage and prematurity rates were consistent with population figures, although termination and, to a lesser extent, live birth rates were underestimated in the register. The pregnancy register offers huge research potential because of its large size, high completeness, and availability. Further validation work is underway to enhance this data resource and identify optimal approaches for its use.",31197928

Supporting patients with tools could improve their confidence in discussions with health professionals and encourage reporting of suspected adrs to regulators. This study describes development and preliminary validation of an instrument: side effect patient assessment tool (se-past). Se-past was developed from survey and interview data involving patients experiencing suspected adrs. It included 10 statements enabling causality assessment, covering timing, additional information sources, and experiences, with four options: yes/no/don't know/not applicable. Scoring and weighting resulted in four categories of causal association: highly probable, probable, possible, unlikely. Validation involved obtaining feedback from 31 individuals experiencing an adr. Further validation involved online distribution through patient support groups and comparison of reported symptoms to known adrs. Validators found se-past easy to read (31), to understand (27), and to complete (29). A total of 294 respondents completed se-past online, with 98% completing eight or more causality assessment statements. Symptoms were categorised as highly probable (46; 16%), probable (80; 62%), possible (44; 15%), and unlikely (21; 7%). A total of 221 respondents identified one suspected medicine, with 95% of these reporting at least one symptom known to be an adr.

Two experienced specialist physicians independently reviewed the medical records and classified cases as ""definite a,"" ""definite b,"" ""probable,"" or ""no gi perforation."" the positive predictive values (ppvs) of ""definite a/b"" cases were calculated after stratification by sex, age, icd-10 code, and diagnostic information in the dpc data. The number of prescribed drugs with side effects of gi perforation according to historical data was compared between ""definite a/b"" and ""no gi perforation"" cases. The overall ppv was 47.0% (95% confidence interval [ci], 36.9-57.2). However, the ppvs for the three categories of diagnostic information in the dpc data (""main diagnosis,"" ""diagnosis causing admission,"" and ""most resource-intensive diagnosis"") were each more than 70% after excluding inappropriate patients. Additionally, the ppv focused on these three categories was 76.3% (95% ci, 59.8-88.6). Prescribed drugs with side effects of gi perforation were more frequently detected in ""definite a/b"" cases (p = .028).

We surveyed older hospital patients about use of sleep-inducing drugs before, during, and after hospitalization and compared these answers with their hospital chart using the kappa statistic. The association between the wish to continue these drugs after discharge and the perceived benefits, experience of side effects, and prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs was determined by multivariable logistic regression. Agreement between patient responses and the hospital file was high (κ = 0.7). Seventeen percent (83/483) of the participants reported prior experience before their hospital stay; 45% received a sleep-inducing drug during hospitalization; 17% wished to continue taking them after discharge. Of the 400 patients who had no prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs, 147 (37%) became first-time users in the hospital, and 27% (40/147) of these wished to continue this medication after discharged. Strong predictors for this wish were the reduction of sleep onset problems (adjusted odds ratio, 6.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.38-16.44) and any prior experience with sleep-inducing drugs (4.08; 1.97-8.48). Many older patients become first-time users of sleep-inducing drugs in the hospital.

However, medicare claims do not contain comprehensive information on some important sources of bias. Thus, we piloted an approach using the medicare current beneficiary survey (mcbs), a nationally representative survey of the medicare population, to (a) assess cohort balance with respect to unmeasured confounders in a herpes zoster vaccine (hzv) effectiveness claims-based study and (b) augment medicare claims with mcbs data to include unmeasured covariates. We reanalyzed data from our published hzv effectiveness medicare analysis, using linkages to mcbs to obtain information on impaired mobility, education, and health-seeking behavior. We assessed survey variable balance between the matched cohorts and selected imbalanced variables for model adjustment, applying multiple imputation by chained equations (mice) to impute these potential unmeasured confounders. The original hzv effectiveness study cohorts appeared well balanced with respect to variables we selected from the mcbs. Our imputed results showed slight shifts in hzv effectiveness point estimates with wider confidence intervals, but indicated no statistically significant differences from the original study estimates. Our innovative use of linked survey data to assess cohort balance and our imputation approach to augment medicare claims with mcbs data to include unmeasured covariates provide potential solutions for addressing bias related to unmeasured confounding in large database studies, thus adding new tools for rwe studies.",31168897

Patient-to-prescriber travel patterns may indicate potential opioid misuse. We introduce doctor hopping, patients bypassing nearby prescribers in favor of more distant ones, as a new spatial estimation of potentially risky behavior, and compare with traditional doctor shopping metrics. We examined all filled opioid prescriptions between 2015 and 2016 from the arkansas prescription drug monitoring program. We calculated patient-to-prescriber travel times and number of prescribers bypassed for each prescription, adjusted for payment method. Opioid recipients traveling further than the nearest urban area and bypassing more prescribers than 99% of other recipients from the same zip code were identified as doctor hoppers. We calculated odds ratios to evaluate how doctor hopping and doctor shopping correspond to high-risk opioid uses. Approximately 0.72% of all opioid recipients in arkansas engaged in doctor hopping two or more times during the study period. Rates of doctor hopping varied spatially but were more common in rural areas. Doctor shopping was more common in urban areas. Both hopping and shopping were significantly associated with higher odds of engaging in high-risk opioid use. The combination of doctor hopping and doctor shopping metrics can predict high-risk use better than either metric alone and may allow for earlier detection than doctor shopping alone. Doctor hopping is positively associated with high-risk opioid use and is distinct from and complementary to doctor shopping.

We also report results from a survey of latin american rheumatologists assessing their understanding of prescribing biosimilars and the pharmacovigilance of these drugs. We reviewed the current guidelines for the regulatory approval of biosimilars and barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in latin american countries. Rheumatologists attending the ii pan-american league of rheumatology associations panlar review course (biosimilars update) in lima, peru were asked to complete a short survey to determine their knowledge of biosimilars. Many latin american countries continue to lag behind europe and the united states in establishing regulatory guidance and effective pharmacovigilance systems for biosimilars. Results from our survey also highlight a lack of awareness regarding the availability of biosimilars, their nomenclature, automatic substitution, and reporting adverse drug reactions because of these drugs. The main barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in latin america are the lack of consensus on the interchangeability of reference biologics and biosimilars, and the need for more suitably trained personnel to carry out effective postmarketing pharmacovigilance of biosimilars. Inconsistencies in biosimilar nomenclature make it difficult to adequately trace drugs and record adverse drug reactions associated with their use, creating a barrier to the global pharmacovigilance of biologics.",31148288

Performance of 206 icd-10-cm code assignments indicative of bleeding, five anticoagulant adverse effect/poisoning codes, and five coagulopathy codes (according to medicare parts a and b claims) as assessed among medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries prescribed anticoagulants between october 1, 2015 and september 30, 2016 (according to part d claims). Structured medical record review was the gold standard for validating the presence of anticoagulant-related bleeding. Sensitivity was adjusted to correct for partial verification bias due to sampling design. Based on the study sample of 1166 records (583 cases, 583 controls), 57 of 206 codes yielded the optimal performance for anticoagulant-related bleeding (diagnostic odds ratio, 51; positive predictive value (ppv), 75.7% [95% ci, 72.0%-79.1%]; adjusted sensitivity, 70.0% [95% ci, 63.2%-77.7%]). Codes for intracranial bleeding demonstrated the highest ppv (85.0%) and adjusted sensitivity (91.0%). Bleeding codes in the primary position demonstrated high ppv (86.9%), but low adjusted sensitivity (36.0%). The adjusted sensitivity improved to 69.5% when codes in a secondary position were added. Only one adverse effect/poisoning code was used, appearing in 7.8% of cases and controls (ppv, 71.4% and adjusted sensitivity, 6.8%). Performance of icd-10-cm code assignments for bleeding among patients prescribed anticoagulants varied by bleed type and code position. Adverse effect/poisoning codes were not commonly used and would have missed over 90% of anticoagulant-related bleeding cases.",31144403

A retrospective analysis of data on prescription labels of dispensed drugs extracted from the pharmacy information system of community pharmacies in the netherlands. Dosing instructions were categorized into four types. Data were extracted from 123 community pharmacies. All drugs dispensed for a random sample of 10% of patients were selected. In the sample of 938 479 prescriptions, 96% had a predefined dosing instruction and 2995 different coded instructions were used. Ninety-five percent of all instructions were covered by 354 coded instructions. Most prescriptions were coded with an instruction indicating once daily use (48.4%) or twice or more times daily use (23.8%) without specification of the time (eg, ""1 tablet 1 time a day""). A general instruction (""use as directed"") was given for 7.0% of all prescriptions, and for 6.0%, the instruction was to use ""as needed."" for most prescriptions (80.6%), one or more auxiliary labels were generated with the warning ""may cause drowsiness"" (17.9%) being the most frequent one. A limited set of instructions covered the majority of the prescriptions. About a quarter of the prescription labels contained nonspecific dosing instructions for use multiple times a day, and 13.0% were general or ""use as needed"" instructions.

The aim of the study was therefore to investigate the views and experiences of adr reporting by community pharmacists in wales, with a particular focus on the potential barriers and facilitators to reporting. Following ethics approval and piloting, a self-complete questionnaire was mailed to all registered community pharmacies in wales, uk (n = 713). A follow-up mailing was sent to nonresponders after 2 weeks. A response rate of 52% (n = 372) was achieved, of whom 57% had never submitted a yellow card. Key barriers to reporting were not seeing adrs, difficulty identifying the causative drug, not being sure which adrs to report, and lack of time. Key facilitators were being able to report through dispensary software and having clearer guidelines about what to report. Differences between those who had previously reported adrs and those who had not suggested lack of confidence and uncertainty about what to report were more of a barrier for nonreporters. Conversely, reporters wanted feedback on reports, ability to keep reports on their dispensary records, and remuneration to aid them with reporting. While the respondents generally expressed positive attitudes towards adr reporting, a number of barriers and potential facilitators were nevertheless identified. Clearer support and guidance for reporting, such as through a ""champions"" scheme similar to that run in welsh hospitals, may help current nonreporters to engage.",31131966

Empirical equipoise was previously proposed as a tool to assess patient similarity based on propensity scores (ps). We extended this work for multigroup observational studies. We modified the tool to allow for multinomial exposures such that the proposed definition reduces to the original when there are only two groups. We illustrated how the tool can be used as a method to assess study design within three-group clinical examples. We then conducted three-group simulations to assess how the tool performed in a setting with residual confounding after ps weighting. In a clinical example based on rheumatoid arthritis, 44.5% of the sample fell within the region of empirical equipoise when considering first-line biologics, whereas 57.7% did so for second-line biologics, consistent with the expectation that a second-line design results in better equipoise. In a simulation where the unmeasured confounder had the same magnitude of association with the treatment as the measured confounders and a 25% greater association with the outcome, the tool crossed the proposed threshold for empirical equipoise at a residual confounding of 20% on the ratio scale. When the unmeasured variable had a twice larger association with treatment, the tool became less sensitive and crossed the threshold at a residual confounding of 30%. Our proposed tool may be useful in guiding cohort identification in multigroup observational studies, particularly with similar effects of unmeasured and measured covariates on treatment and outcome.",31131965

We conducted a descriptive analysis of a spontaneous reporting system in china to describe the safety profile of tcm injections. The safety profile of tcm injections is described by descriptive analysis of 559 066 adverse reports collected from guangdong provincial center for adverse drug reaction (adr) monitoring in china during 2003 to 2017. The percentage of new or serious adrs of tcm injections is much higher than average percentage of china's spontaneous reporting system (srs) as a whole (48.70% vs <25%). Compared with conventional injections, tcm injections have a slightly lower percentage of serious adrs (6.02% vs 6.72%) and much higher percentage of unknown (new) adrs (46.74% vs 24.13%). The gender and age distribution for tcm injections are similar to conventional injections. The reporting rates of adrs increased with age. Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reaction are high-risk adrs for tcm injections and, anaphylactic shock is ranked number 1 in causing deaths (50.00%). There are some differences and similarities on the safety profile between tcm injections and conventional injections. Tcm injections have higher risk of adverse effects than any other dosage forms of tcm medications and higher percentage of new or serious adverse effects than conventional injections. A lot of work need to be done to clarify the huge amount of potential unknown adverse effects related to tcm injections.",31131950

All 354 854 individuals in sweden with a hospital diagnosis of atrial fibrillation during 2010-2016 were included. At least 13 years of observational data prior to inclusion was available for all patients. The prevalence of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, previous thromboembolism, and vascular disease was estimated from data with different lookback periods. The incident stroke rates at cha  ds  -vasc score 1 was then assessed using data with successively longer lookback periods. Depending on duration of lookback period, the proportion of patients with heart failure varied 2.7 times, thromboembolism 3.7 times, hypertension 4.0 times, and diabetes and vascular disease both approximately 4.5 times. During follow-up, 22 237 patients suffered an ischaemic stroke. The estimated risk without anticoagulant treatment at cha  ds  -vasc score 1 was 51% higher if the scores had been calculated with the shortest lookback period than if all information had been used. Short lookback periods underestimate comorbidity, cause high-risk patients to be misclassified as low risk, and overestimate stroke risk at cha  ds  -vasc 1. This may lead to unnecessary anticoagulant treatment of true low-risk patients. Transparency regarding lookback periods is essential for interpretation and comparison of registry studies.",31112361

Data were from kaiser permanente northwest (kpnw), a large integrated health plan. We iteratively developed and evaluated an algorithm for electronically identifying inpatient overdose/oversedation in kpnw hospitals from 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2014. Chart audits assessed accuracy; data sources included administrative and clinical records. The best-performing algorithm used these rules: (1) include events with opioids administered in an inpatient setting (including emergency department/urgent care) followed by naloxone administration within 275 hours of continuous inpatient stay; (2) exclude events with electroconvulsive therapy procedure codes; and (3) exclude events in which an opioid was administered prior to hospital discharge and followed by readmission with subsequent naloxone administration. Using this algorithm, we identified 870 suspect inpatient overdose/oversedation events and chart audited a random sample of 235. Of the random sample, 185 (78.7%) were deemed overdoses/oversedation, 37 (15.5%) were not, and 13 (5.5%) were possible cases. The number of hours between time of opioid and naloxone administration did not affect algorithm accuracy. When ""possible"" overdoses/oversedations were included with confirmed events, overall positive predictive value (ppv) was very good (ppv = 84.0%). Additionally, ppv was reasonable when evaluated specifically for hospital stays with emergency/urgent care admissions (ppv = 77.0%) and excellent for elective surgery admissions (ppv = 97.0%).

Arguments in favor of prescriber preference as an instrumental variable and suggestions for how to approach specific scenarios that may be encountered are offered.

Common designs have included pregnancy registries and case-control studies. Recently, pregnancy cohorts nested within healthcare utilization databases are increasingly being used. Despite clear advantages, these databases share some important limitations that may threaten the validity of studies emerging from them. This paper describes the distinctive methodological aspects of conducting drug safety studies in healthcare utilization databases with special emphasis on design and analytic approaches to minimize biases. We describe considerations for study design, cohort definition, and follow-up. We then address issues related to exposure ascertainment based on prescription fills, including the importance of the etiologically relevant window and of properly accounting for preterm births. This is followed by a discussion of advantages and challenges when ascertaining maternal and infant outcomes based on secondary data. We then explore useful approaches to address confounding within the context of pregnancy research and of the potential for selection bias when restricting the cohort to live births. Finally, we consider issues related to external validity and statistical significance. The examples are mainly drawn from a pregnancy cohort nested in the medicaid analytic extract. The approaches presented provide guidance regarding the important methodological considerations that need to be attended to in order to generate valid, minimally biased risk when using large healthcare utilization databases for drug safety surveillance in pregnancy.",31074570

A nested case-control study was conducted in a cohort of adult patients receiving ≥6 months of warfarin therapy who were prospectively followed up at a tertiary care hospital in thailand during january 2011 to december 2014. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with wamb. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (auroc) curve was used to assess the performance of the has-bled score to predict wamb in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (nvaf). Among 1604 patients (2972 patient-year of follow-up), there were 93 major bleeding that occurred in 76 patients. The incidence of wamb was 3.13 events per 100 patient-year.

Vaccine exposure in approximately 30% of the swedish population in 2009 was linked to information on narcolepsy diagnosis retrieved from the national patient registry. Cases were verified by a systematic chart review. Poisson regression was used to compare incidence in defined time windows following vaccination. Of 266 cases of narcolepsy identified, 25% (66/266) were prevalent cases with symptom onset documented before vaccine exposure. Incident cases had a median time interval between first symptom and the date recorded in the patient registry of 64 weeks (iqr 39-107) when vaccinated (n = 182) and 65 weeks (iqr 51-72) when unvaccinated (n = 16). With first symptom defining index date, the adjusted risk for narcolepsy in younger patients was increased 14 times during the first year after vaccination, three times elevated the second year, but with no detectable increased risk more than 2 years after vaccination exposure. Using the index date from the patient registry, the adjusted increase in risk was about seven times elevated for all three time intervals. The magnitude of the estimated increased risk for narcolepsy following exposure to the a(h1n1) pandemic vaccine is highly dependent on the method used to determine the index date for disease onset. The sometimes very long and potentially variable interval from first symptom to a health care registry diagnosis complicates estimations of risk.",31062443

There may be potential benefits for patients, health services, and antimicrobial stewardship if shorter antibiotic treatment resulted in similar outcomes. We aimed to determine if treatment duration could be reduced by estimating risk of adverse outcomes according to different prescription durations. This retrospective cohort study included men aged greater than or equal to 65 years old with a suspected uti. We compared outcomes in men prescribed 3, 5, 7, and 8 to 14 days of antibiotic treatment in a multivariable logistic regression analysis and 3 versus 7 days in a propensity-score matched analysis. Our outcomes were reconsultation and represcription (proxy for treatment failure), hospitalisation for uti, sepsis, or acute kidney injury (aki), and death. Of 360 640 men aged greater than or equal to 65 years, 33 745 (9.4%) had a uti.

We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for algorithms relative to medical chart review and conducted assessments of algorithm portability in kaiser permanente washington, tennessee state medicaid, and optum. Code-based algorithm performance was excellent for opioid-related overdoses (sensitivity = 97.2%, specificity = 84.6%) and classification of heroin-involved overdoses (sensitivity = 91.8%, specificity = 99.0%). Performance was acceptable for code-based suicide/suicide attempt classifications (sensitivity = 70.7%, specificity = 90.5%); sensitivity improved with nlp (sensitivity = 78.7%, specificity = 91.0%). Performance was acceptable for the code-based substance abuse-involved classification (sensitivity = 75.3%, specificity = 79.5%); sensitivity improved with the nlp-enhanced algorithm (sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 76.3%). The opioid-related overdose algorithm performed well across portability assessment sites, with sensitivity greater than 96% and specificity greater than 84%. Cross-site sensitivity for heroin-involved overdose was greater than 87%, specificity greater than or equal to 99%. Code-based algorithms developed to detect opioid-related overdoses and classify them according to heroin involvement perform well. Algorithms for classifying suicides/attempts and abuse-related opioid overdoses perform adequately for use for research, particularly given the complexity of classifying such overdoses. The nlp-enhanced algorithms for suicides/suicide attempts and abuse-related overdoses perform significantly better than code-based algorithms and are appropriate for use in settings that have data and capacity to use nlp.",31020755

While theory suggests that the classical bootstrap can fail to produce proper coverage, practical impact of this theoretical limitation in settings typical to pharmacoepidemiology is not well studied. In a plasmode-based simulation study, we compared performance of the standard parametric approach, which ignores uncertainty in ps estimation and matching, with two bootstrapping methods. The first method only accounted for uncertainty introduced during the matching process (the observation resampling approach). The second method accounted for uncertainty introduced during both ps estimation and matching processes (the ps reestimation approach). Variance was estimated based on percentile and empirical standard errors, and treatment effect estimation was based on median and mean of the estimated treatment effects across 1000 bootstrap resamples. Two treatment prevalence scenarios (5% and 29%) across two treatment effect scenarios (hazard ratio of 1.0 and 2.0) were evaluated in 500 simulated cohorts of 10 000 patients each. We observed that 95% confidence intervals from the bootstrapping approaches but not the standard approach, resulted in inaccurate coverage rates (98%-100% for the observation resampling approach, 99%-100% for the ps reestimation approach, and 95%-96% for standard approach). Treatment effect estimation based on bootstrapping approaches resulted in lower bias than the standard approach (less than 1.4% vs 4.1%) at 5% treatment prevalence; however, the performance was equivalent at 29% treatment prevalence. Use of bootstrapping led to variance overestimation and inconsistent coverage, while coverage remained more consistent with parametric estimation.",31020732

We carried out a population-based study to assess the trend of all-cause pneumonia in children aged under 10 years between 2002 and 2012. Data were obtained from the ims disease analyser, a primary care database in the united kingdom. Three time periods were defined to estimate monthly incidence: pre-pcv7 (january 2002 to august 2006), post-pcv7 (september 2006 to march 2010), and post-pcv13 (april 2010 to december 2012). Interrupted time series analysis (its) was performed to assess any immediate change or gradual change in the monthly incidence of pneumonia between prevaccination and postvaccination introduction. A total of 4228 children with at least one all-cause pneumonia episode were identified. The overall annual incidence rate of all-cause pneumonia declined by 37% from 3.8 episodes/1000 person-years in 2002 to 2.4 episodes/1000 person-years in 2012. Results of its analyses indicated that the incidence did not decline immediately after the introduction of pcv7 and pcv13. The incidence declined gradually in children aged under 2 years (irr = 0.98; 95% ci, 0.97-0.99) post pcv7 and levelled off during post pcv13 (irr = 1.00; 95% ci, 0.99-1.02). No significant changes in incidence trend was observed in children aged 2 to 4 years (irr = 0.86; 95% ci, 0.68-1.07) and 5 to 9 years (irr = 0.92; 95% ci, 0.73-1.15) after pcv13 introduction. In the united kingdom, the incidence of all-cause pneumonia in children under 2 years declined after the introduction of pcv7 and levelled off in the first 2 years of introduction of pcv13. Continual monitoring is warranted to assess the population impact of pcv13 in preventing childhood pneumonia in the long term.",30993835

We report results from two independently conducted studies in denmark and sweden, with 19,709 danish and 17,592 swedish patients, who received at least one outpatient dispensing of apixaban as identified through nationwide prescription registries. Indications, inferred from inpatient and hospital diagnoses recorded at the initial apixaban dispensing, were classified as on-label, off-label, or unclassified according to the summary of product characteristics. All diagnoses were retrieved using inpatient or outpatient hospital diagnoses at the first outpatient dispensing during the study period. Men comprised 52% of the users in both denmark and sweden. The median age was 76 years (interquartile range [iqr]: 68-83 years) among danish patients and 74 years (iqr: 67-82 years) among swedish patients.

The impact of proposed data collection restrictions is unknown. This study aimed to assess the impact of restricting the scope of electronic health record (ehr) data collection on the ability to conduct research. The study estimated the consequences of restricted data collection on published clinical practice research datalink studies from high impact journals or referenced in clinical guidelines. A structured form was used to systematically analyse the extent to which individual studies would have been possible using a database with data collection restrictions in place: (1) retrospective collection of specified diseases only; (2) retrospective collection restricted to a 6- or 12-year period; (3) prospective and retrospective collection restricted to non-sensitive data. Outcomes were categorised as unfeasible (not reproducible without major bias); compromised (feasible with design modification); or unaffected. Overall, 91% studies were compromised with all restrictions in place; 56% studies were unfeasible even with design modification. With restrictions on diseases alone, 74% studies were compromised; 51% were unfeasible. Restricting collection to 6/12 years had a major impact, with 67 and 22% of studies compromised, respectively. Restricting collection of sensitive data had a lesser but marked impact with 10% studies compromised. Ehr data collection restrictions can profoundly reduce the capacity for public health research that underpins evidence-based medicine and clinical guidance.

The pilot studies were designed to address three major objectives in postmarketing drug safety assessments, ie, the examination of actual drug utilization, the impact of safety-related regulatory actions, and drug-associated risks. The five studies were conducted on the following topics: (a) utilization of codeine-containing products and its relationship with respiratory depression, (b) impact of a dear healthcare professional letter on hypocalcemia incidence associated with denosumab (ranmark  ) use, (c) risk of acute myocardial infarction associated with antidiabetic drug use, (d) risk of glucose metabolism disorders associated with atypical antipsychotic drug use, and (e) prospective monitoring of abnormal laboratory test results during new drug prescriptions. The pilot studies were successfully conducted and demonstrated the value of mid-net  in postmarketing drug safety assessments. In particular, the ability to utilize laboratory test results as objective clinical indicators is a major advantage of this database. Potential limitations include a relatively small sample size and a lack of patient-level data linkages among hospitals. Mid-net  was confirmed to be a valuable database for postmarketing drug safety assessments.

Our objective was to estimate the association between chronic opioid use and risk of second breast cancer events (sbces). Cohort study of women greater than or equal to 18 years, diagnosed with early stage breast cancer between january 1, 1990, and december 31, 2008, and enrolled in a large health plan for 1+ years before and after (unless died) diagnosis. Sbces were defined as evidence of recurrence or second primary breast cancer in the medical chart. Chronic opioid use was defined as 75+ days of use in any moving 90-day window after breast cancer diagnosis and varied to 150+ days in a 180-day window in a sensitivity analysis. Using cox proportional hazards models, we estimated hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for sbce and components of sbce by chronic opioid use. Almost 10% met the criteria for chronic use and almost a third of users were taking opioids for greater than 3 years. Risk of sbces (hr = 1.20; 95% ci, 0.85-1.70), including second primary breast cancer (hr = 1.38; 95% ci, 0.71-2.70), was nonsignificantly higher among chronic users vs nonchronic/nonusers. The hr for recurrence was 1.14 (95% ci, 0.76-2.70). Results of the sensitivity analyses on longer opioid use does support an association with sbce or recurrence.

Previous literatures studied the medication use and falls in the community, hospitals, or nursing homes, with scanty data about alf. Therefore, the aim of the current case-control study was to assess the relation between medication use and falls among elderly in alf. A matched case-control study was conducted. The study was conducted in alf in cairo, egypt. The study participants were 188 individuals; they were subdivided into two groups: fallers and nonfallers; timed up and go test (tugt) was performed by all subjects. Medication data were collected according to the fall risk-increasing drugs list and the list of drugs that cause or worsen orthostatism. Other fall risk factors, as suggested by american geriatric society, were assessed. The use of vasodilators, diuretics, alpha blockers, opioids, antipsychotics, and sedative hypnotics were more common in fallers than in nonfallers (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, p < 0.001, p = 0.013, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Vasodilators, alpha blockers, and antipsychotics were significant predictors of falls even after adjustment for the possible confounding factors. Vasodilators, alpha blockers, opioids, sedative hypnotics, and recent dose changes in oral hypoglycemics were significant predictors of higher tugt after adjustment for the possible confounding factors.

We selected a control group without tuberculosis using 1:1 exact matching based on age, sex, index year, insurance type, and income level. We investigated ppi exposure 2 years prior to the index date and classified the subjects into nonuser, continuous user, recent user, and former user groups. Odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for tuberculosis development were calculated using conditional logistic regression. A total of 51 344 cases and controls were analyzed. Recent ppi use (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 1.28; 95% ci, 1.18-1.39) and continuous ppi use (aor, 1.13; 95% ci 1.10-1.28) were significantly associated with tuberculosis development, compared with nonuse of ppis. An increased tuberculosis incidence was not observed in the former use group compared with the nonuse group (aor 1.05, 95% ci 0.95-1.17).

In the optum-premier population, exposures were mapped from the admission date among those with a primary diagnosis of bacteremia. Our study included 50 467 bacteremia admissions, with only 14% of admissions having the same treatment pattern as another admission. For every 100 bacteremia admissions, 89 had changes in antibiotic therapy. For every 100 bacteremia admissions with changes in therapy, 95 had unique antibiotic treatment patterns. These findings were consistent in both populations, over time, and among different facilities within study populations. The median time to first therapy change was 2 days after initial therapy, with a median of three changes. Changes in antibiotic therapy for bloodstream infections were nearly universal regardless of hospital setting. Based on our findings, common antibiotic exposure definitions of intent-to-treat and definitive therapy would misclassify exposure in 86% of admissions, which highlights the need for better operational definitions of exposure in infectious diseases research.",30916833

We searched diversion case reports of all other nonscheduled psychoactive prescription drugs in the researched abuse, diversion, and addiction-related surveillance (radars) system. Case report data are drawn from a quarterly survey of prescription drug diversion completed by a national sample of law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Rates of diversion per 100 000 population were calculated for each year from 2002 to 2017 for prescription medications with greater than 400 reported cases during the period. Cyclobenzaprine, quetiapine, and trazodone met criteria for analysis. We found a significant and steady increase in the diversion of each drug over the period. The 2017 annual rates of diversion per 100 000 population for the three medications range from 0.0428 to 0.0726. Although these rates of diversion are much lower than the rate for total opioid analgesics, they are all more than five times higher in 2017 compared with 2002. While diversion rates for opioids have decreased in recent years, rates for cyclobenzaprine, quetiapine, and trazodone have continued to increase. A common attribute of the three nonscheduled drugs studied here is that all are used for the treatment and/or self-treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and the increasing diversion of these drugs may be related to the ongoing opioid epidemic and to increasing levels of control over pharmaceutical opioid availability in the united states. Prescribers need to be aware of illicit markets for these medications and prescribe to their patients with appropriate caution.",30909323

Robust mortality prediction models using routinely collected health care data can enhance health care stakeholders' ability to identify populations with limited life expectancy. We developed and validated a claims-based prediction model for 5-year mortality using regularized regression methods. Medicare beneficiaries age 66 or older with an office visit and at least 12 months of pre-visit continuous medicare a/b enrollment were identified in 2008. Five-year mortality was assessed through 2013. Secondary outcomes included 30-, 90-, and 180-day and 1-year mortality. Claims-based predictors, including comorbidities and indicators of disability, frailty, and functional impairment, were selected using regularized logistic regression, applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) in a random 80% training sample. Model performance was assessed and compared with the gagne comorbidity score in the 20% validation sample. Overall, 183 204 (24%) individuals died. In addition to demographics, 161 indicators of comorbidity and function were included in the final model. In the validation sample, the c-statistic was 0.825 (0.823-0.828). Median-predicted probability of 5-year mortality was 14%; almost 4% of the cohort had a predicted probability greater than 80%.

The study was conducted using the flatiron health oncology database and the national death index (ndi) as a gold standard. Three analytic frameworks were evaluated in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ansclc) patients: median overall survival [mos]), relative risk estimates conducted within the ehr-derived database, and ""external control arm"" analyses comparing an experimental group augmented with mortality data from the gold standard to a control group from the ehr-derived database only. The hazard ratios (hrs) obtained within the ehr-derived database (91% sensitivity) and the external control arm analyses, were compared with results when both groups were augmented with mortality data from the gold standard. The above analyses were repeated using simulated lower mortality sensitivities to understand the impact of more extreme levels of missing deaths. Bias in mos ranged from modest (0.6-0.9 mos.) in the ehr-derived cohort with (91% sensitivity) to substantial when lower sensitivities were generated through simulation (3.3-9.7 mos.). Overall, small differences were observed in the hrs for the ehr-derived cohort across comparative analyses when compared with hrs obtained using the gold standard data source. When only one treatment arm was subject to estimation bias, the bias was slightly more pronounced, but increased substantially when lower sensitivities were simulated. The impact on survival analysis is minimal with high mortality sensitivity with only modest impact associated within external control arm applications.",30873729

We examined adherence trajectories and early discontinuation of endocrine therapy over 5 years from treatment initiation. Our retrospective cohort study used a national sample of australian women dispensed publicly subsidised trastuzumab for early her2-positive breast cancer. We included women initiating endocrine therapy between april 2007 and june 2011, followed until june 2016 (n = 2656). We used group-based trajectory modelling and kaplan-meier analysis to examine patterns of adherence and time to discontinuation and restarting. We identified five adherence trajectories: quick decline (10.4%), moderate decline (8.6%), quick decline then stable (10.3%), stable with late decline (23.6%), and high and stable (47.2%). Women in the high and stable trajectory group were older and more likely to initiate therapy with anastrozole than women in other groups. Time periods after first 6 months, 1.5, and 4 years from initiation seemed critical in terms of remaining adherent on endocrine therapy; 45.8% of the cohort discontinued endocrine therapy with a median time to discontinuation of 2.6 years (interquartile range 1.0-4.4), and 45.8% of the women discontinuing restarted treatment (median time 182.0, interquartile range 133.0-279.0 days). Our study highlights evidence-practice gaps in the use of endocrine therapy, with half of our sample experiencing suboptimal adherence or persistence. Trajectory modelling provided detailed information about patterns of nonadherence and critical time periods for adherence to endocrine therapy. This information is important for developing targeted interventions to improve adherence.",30861596

The prevalence of prescribed aeds, the maximum dose of some aeds, and the frequency of potential combination therapy with aeds were evaluated for the 180 days before pregnancy onset, during pregnancy, and at 180-day postpartum. In total, 33 941 pregnant women were eligible for analysis. At least one aed was prescribed to 225 women (66 per 10 000 deliveries) between 180 days before pregnancy and 180-day postpartum and for 135 women (40 per 10 000 deliveries) during pregnancy. The prevalence of aed prescription declined during the first and second trimesters and increased in the third trimester and postpartum. Valproate was the most frequently prescribed drug, followed by clonazepam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine. Nine (18.4%) of the 49 women with at least one prescription record of valproate in the first trimester were prescribed more than 600 mg/day of valproate. Concerning potential combination therapy, 40 (12 per 10 000 deliveries) concurrently received two or more aeds between 180 days before pregnancy and 180-day postpartum, respectively, 31 (9 per 10 000 deliveries) women received these drugs during pregnancy.

Although the association between proton-pump inhibitors (ppis) and cdad has been established, little is known among high-risk antibiotics users. This study aimed to identify the association between ppis and cdad in high-risk antibiotics users by using a case-crossover design. We conducted a case-crossover study using a nationwide population-based cohort in south korea. Participants who developed cdad from 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2013 and had prior prescription records of both ppis and high-risk antibiotics were included. The hazard period was 49 days, and the three prior control periods had the same duration as the hazard period. The status of exposure to ppis was assessed during the hazard and control periods in each patient and discordant pairs of exposure were used to estimate the matched odds ratio (or). In total, 200 participants with cdad who had histories of both ppis and high-risk antibiotics use were included. A twofold increased risk for cdad due to ppi use was observed (or = 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2). The time-invariant variables including age group, sex, and comorbidities were proven not to modify the association between ppis and cdad. Our study suggested that ppis increase the risk of developing cdad in high-risk antibiotics users. Thus, ppis should be used cautiously in patients requiring high-risk antibiotics in the situation of medical treatment to prevent further incidence of cdad.",30848536

Patients aged more than or equal to 18 years with at least one hip arthroplasty including total and partial hip replacements and hip replacement revisions during july 2009 to june 2013 were identified from the health insurance review and assessment (hira) database. The study outcome was incidence rate of thromboembolic events and anticoagulation-related major bleeding within 90 days of hip arthroplasty. The incidence of overall venous thromboembolism (vte) within 90-day postsurgery was significantly higher in the aspirin cohort than it was in the rivaroxaban cohorts. Bleeding events associated with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in patients who received rivaroxaban were not significantly different from that in aspirin-treated patients. In aspirin cohorts, 65.7% of patients received less than 3-week treatment while about half received a less than 14-day treatment, and 31.7% received more than 3-week treatment in the rivaroxaban cohort. This study demonstrates that rivaroxaban was more effective in preventing vte following hip arthroplasty without raising bleeding risks in clinical settings.

Using linked uk health care databases, we developed risk prediction equations for key ischemic and bleeding events using cox proportional hazards models. Trial hazard ratios, relative to placebo, were applied to baseline risk estimates to compute expected attributable risks, summed to derive a per-patient net clinical benefit (ncb). High risk subgroups were defined a priori, and gaussian mixture models (gmm) were fit to characterize the ncb distribution and identify subgroups with similar ncbs. Ncb was consistently positive for all subgroups, likely due to the outcome correlation, and would remain positive with a 12-fold increase in bleeding risk. Gmms identified three distinct ncb subgroups. Compared with the middle/lower ncb subgroups, those with a higher ncb tended to be older, female, and have higher cv disease burden. Personalized b-r assessments are feasible and clinically valuable and can be used to better predict who would benefit most from therapy.",30848010

A retrospective study was performed using national data from the emergency department (ed)-based injury in-depth surveillance database. The patients diagnosed with poisoning were sorted from 2011 to 2016 and included in the study. As the act was implemented from 2013, the demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared before and after january 2013. A piecewise regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the monthly use of acetaminophen, medication for cold, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and the incidence of total poisonings before and after the january 2013. Among 1 536 277 patients included in the database, 17 523 patients diagnosed with poisoning were enrolled. After the legislative change, the etiology of poisoning did not change, although the frequency of hospitalization from ed was significantly increased. The monthly trend for poisoning due to acetaminophen, cold medications, and nsaids showed no significant slope change between before and after the legislative change. The proportional use of acetaminophen and cold medications was significantly decreased, while that of nsaids was unchanged before and after the legislative change.

We reviewed medical records in a sample of presumed hypoglycemia events among patients who received care at the veterans health administration tennessee valley healthcare system in 2001 to 2012. A hypoglycemia event was defined as a hospitalization or emergency department visit judged by the treating clinician to be due to hypoglycemia, or an outpatient laboratory or point-of-care blood glucose measurement <60 mg/dl. Based on medical record review, each event was classified as true positive (severe, documented symptomatic, documented asymptomatic) or false positive (probable symptomatic, not hypoglycemia). The positive predictive values (ppv) of the individual event types (hospitalization, emergency department, and outpatient) were estimated. Of 2250 events identified through the composite definition, 321 events (15 hospitalizations, 103 emergency department visits, and 203 outpatient events) were reviewed. The ppvs were 80% for hospitalization events, 48% for emergency department events, and 96% for outpatient events. The emergency department definition included a nonspecific diagnosis code for diabetic complications which captured many false positive events. Excluding this code from the definition improved the ppv for emergency department events to 70% and missed one true event.

This paper evaluates the potential sources of that variability that led to unexpected divergence in findings. We systematically compared the two studies and evaluated programming differences and their potential impact using a different dataset that allowed more granular data access for investigation. We reviewed the output at each of five main processing steps common in both study programs: cohort identification, propensity score estimation, propensity score matching, patient follow-up, and risk estimation. Our findings point to several design features that warrant greater investigator attention when performing observational database studies: (a) treatment of recorded events (eg, diagnoses, procedures, and dispensings) co-occurring on the index date of study drug dispensing in cohort eligibility criteria and propensity score estimation and (b) construction of treatment episodes for study drugs of interest that have more complex dispensing patterns.

The prevalence of patients on an iad regimen (p  ) was also estimated. A small validation study based on data from clinical records confirmed the excellent sensitivity and specificity of this approach. A total of 515 803 prescriptions for lhrh analog were dispensed over a 5-year period (2008 to 2012) to 35 089 pca patients. The mean age (±sd) was 77 years (±9).

Findings that prenatal nsaid exposure may affect offspring neurodevelopment have been inconsistent. We investigated the effect of prenatal nsaid exposure on childhood neurodevelopment and explored the susceptibility of our effect estimates to forms of bias via negative exposure, negative outcome, and multi-informant analyses. In a cohort of pregnant women (n = 6876), perinatal nsaid use was assessed by prescriptions and self-report. Primary neurodevelopmental outcomes included attention problems using maternal reports at 1½, 3, and 5 years. To explore potential systematic biases, we compared estimates from maternally reported attention problems to a teacher's report and a measure of nonverbal intelligence assessed at a clinic visit at age 6 years; we also used nsaid use before pregnancy and somatic problems as a ""negative"" exposure and outcome, respectively. Maternal reports suggested that prenatal exposure to nsaids was associated with more attention problems at younger ages (eg, at age 3: mean difference in attention problems score: 0.30; 95% ci 0.12, 0.48). However, no strong association with attention problems was found in the teacher report, and a similarly strong association between prenatal nsaid exposure and somatic complaints suggests residual confounding by indication likely remains. Moreover, prenatal exposure to nsaids was not associated with an observed measure of iq (mean difference in iq score: -0.32; 95% ci: -1.82, 1.19). Jointly, our results suggest that the observed associations between prenatal exposure to nsaids and child attention problems reflect systematic biases of a null or small effect.",30838712

To assess how the revised code fits the ecosystem of noninterventional pharmacoepidemiology research in europe, we first mapped key recommendations of the revised code against ispe good pharmacoepidemiology practices and the advance code of conduct. We surveyed stakeholders to understand perceptions on its value and practical applicability. Representatives from the different stakeholders' groups described their experience and expectations. Unmet needs in pharmacoepidemiological research are fulfilled by providing unique guidance on roles and responsibilities to support scientific independence. The principles of scientific independence and transparency are well understood and reinforce trust in study results; however, around 70% of survey respondents still found some provisions difficult to apply.

Besides left truncation and competing events, it is crucial to account for the time-dynamic pattern of drug exposure. In fact, potentially harmful medications are often discontinued, which might affect the outcome. Ignoring these challenges may lead to biased estimation of drug-related risks highlighting the need for adequate statistical techniques. We reanalyze updated data of a recently published study provided by the german embryotox pharmacovigilance institute. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect of discontinuation of vitamin k antagonist phenprocoumon on the risk of spontaneous abortion. We outline multistate methodology as a powerful method removing bias in probability estimation inherent to commonly used crude proportions. We incorporate time-dependent discontinuation and competing pregnancy outcomes as separate states in a multistate model, which enables the formulation of hazard-based cox proportional hazard models and the application of so-called landmark techniques. Results show that early discontinuation of phenprocoumon substantially reduces the risk of spontaneous abortion, which is of great importance for both pregnant women and treating physicians. An adequate handling of discontinuation times is essential when analyzing the risk of spontaneous abortion. The proposed concepts are not restricted to pregnancy outcome studies but have broad usage in other fields of epidemiology.

We used the danish cancer registry to identify all patients with incident colorectal adenocarcinoma from 2008 to 2015 (n = 25 814). Each cancer case was matched to ten population controls. Linking information from danish registers, we quantified cumulative phthalate exposure to the ortho-phthalates diethyl phthalate (dep) and dibutyl phthalate (dbp) as well as enteric phthalate polymers from orally administered drugs. The association between cumulative phthalate exposure and colorectal cancer was estimated using conditional logistic regression. Cumulative exposure to ortho-phthalates exceeding 500 mg was associated with lower odds of colorectal cancer diagnosis (or   = 0.89; 95% ci, 0.81-0.96). Similar associations were observed for all dep exposure exceeding 500 mg.

We measured trends in strong opioid use as dispensings/1000 population/year and stratified dispensing in 2015 by patient age and sex. From 2003 to 2015, strong opioid dispensing of very low, low, moderate, and high du increased 6.7-, 6.2-, 2.2-, and 1.8-fold, respectively.

In 2015, the number of dispensings/1000 population for very low, low, moderate, and high du were 180.3, 77.0, 52.7, and 34.8, respectively. Females aged greater than or equal to 85 years had the highest opioid use, ranging from 157.1 dispensings/1000 population for high du to 2104.5 dispensings/1000 population for very low du. In contrast, the high du dispensings in males aged 25 to 64 years exceeded their female counterparts by approximately 1.3-fold. Relative to moderate and high du strong opioids, dispensing of very low and low du strong opioids increased dramatically during the study period in australia. Future studies investigating opioids use and harms in elderly females and males between 25 to 64 years are warranted.",30790376

The knowledge translation team, one of cnodes' four main teams, evaluates the impact of its efforts using an iterative and emergent approach. This article shares key lessons from early evaluation phases, including identifying stakeholders and their evaluation needs, choosing evaluation theories and approaches, and developing evaluation questions, designs, and methods appropriate for the cnodes context. Stakeholder analysis was conducted using documentary analysis to determine key contextual factors and research evidence needs of decision maker partners and other stakeholders. Selected theories and frameworks from the evaluation and knowledge translation literature informed decisions about evaluation design and implementation. A developmental approach to evaluation was deemed appropriate due to the innovative, complex, and ever-changing context. A theory of change, logic model, and potential evaluation questions were developed, informed by the stakeholder analysis. Early indicators of program impact (citation metrics, alternative metrics) have been documented; efforts to collect data on additional indicators are ongoing. A flexible, iterative, and emergent evaluation approach allows the knowledge translation team to apply lessons learned from completed projects to ongoing research projects, adapt its approaches based on stakeholder needs, document successes, and be accountable to funders/stakeholders. This evaluation approach may be useful for other international pharmacoepidemiology research networks planning and implementing evaluations of similarly complex, multistakeholder initiatives that are subject to constant change.",30788900

If individuals who disenroll are different from those who remain enrolled, informative censoring may bias descriptive statistics as well as estimates of causal effect. We explored whether patterns of disenrollment varied by patient or health plan characteristics. In a large cohort of commercially insured adults (2007-2013), we examined two primary outcomes: (a) within-year disenrollment between january 1 and december 30, which was considered to occur due to patient disenrollment from the health plan, and (b) end-of-year disenrollment on december 31, which was considered to occur due to either patient disenrollment from the health plan or withdrawal of the entire health plan from the commercial insurance database. In yearly cohorts, we identified factors independently associated with disenrollment by using log-binomial regression models to estimate risk ratios (rr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). Among 2 053 100 unique patient years, the annual proportion of within-year disenrollment remained steady across years (range, 13% to 14%) whereas the annual proportion of end-of-year disenrollment varied widely (range, 8% to 26%). Independent predictors of within-year disenrollment were related to health status, including age, comorbidities, frailty, hospitalization, emergency room visits, use of durable medical equipment, use of preventive care, and use of prescription medications. In contrast, independent predictors of end-of-year disenrollment were related to health plan characteristics including insurance plan type and geographic characteristics. Differential risk of disenrollment suggests that analytic approaches to address selection bias should be considered in studies using commercial insurance databases.",30788887

We used simulations to compare fixed-duration versus all-available caps for confounder adjustment in the presence of differences in available baseline time between exposure groups. We simulated cohorts of 10 000 patients with binary variables for a single confounder, exposure, and outcome. Baseline time was simulated based on the observed distribution in a claims-based comparison of statin users versus nonusers. We compared bias after measuring confounders using fixed-duration and all-available caps, both when exposure groups had similar and discrepant amounts of available baseline time. When the comparison groups had similar amounts of baseline time, an all-available cap was less biased than a fixed-duration cap. When baseline time differed between comparison groups, the preferable cap approach depended on the direction of confounding and which exposure group had higher covariate sensitivity. These findings were consistent in direction across sensitivity analyses. In certain settings of differential available baseline time between exposure groups, the all-available cap was more biased than the fixed-duration cap. The relative directions and strengths of confounding and misclassification biases are an important consideration when choosing between a fixed-duration or all-available cap, but they are often unknown. Therefore, we recommend comparing the amount of available baseline time between exposure groups. When there is a large discrepancy, despite appropriate design choices, we recommend a fixed-duration approach to avoid potential increases in bias because of differential data availability.",30786103

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term adherence, persistence, and re-initiation of bpl agents among older australians (aged ≥65 years). We utilised the pharmaceutical benefits scheme data covering a 10% random sample of australians. We identified 31 088 older australians (mean age, 75.4 years; 56% females) with newly initiated bpl therapy from 2008 to 2016. Adherence was assessed using the proportion of days covered (pdc) at 6-month intervals. Discontinuation was defined as ≥90 days without bpl coverage. Cox regression was applied to compare the time till the first discontinuation of bpl agents across different bpl categories and among various subgroups. Over a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, 40% to 70% of older australians received a bpl agent discontinued it. The median time to discontinuation ranged from 159 to 373 days. Persistence with fixed dose combinations was the best (68%, 58%, and 41% at 6, 12, and 36 months respectively), followed by angiotensin ii receptor blockers (69%, 58%, and 40%), beta-blockers (67%, 54%, and 36%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (62%, 51%, and 34%), calcium channel blockers (57%, 47%, and 31%), and diuretics (59%, 41%, and 23%).

We first used simulations to compare the performances of different ps-based methods, either alone or in combination with further mlr adjustment, in estimating att. Ps methods were, respectively, optimal pair (opm) and full (ofm) ps matching, subclassification on the ps (sbc), and the inverse probability of treatment weighting (iptw). We simulated several scenarios, according to different sample sizes, proportions of treated vs untreated subjects, and types of hrqol outcomes. We also applied the same methods to a real clinical data set. Opm and iptw provided the closest type i error to the nominal threshold α = 0.05 across all scenarios. Overall, both methods showed also lower variability in estimates than sbc and ofm. Sbc performed worst, generally providing the highest levels of bias. Further mlr adjustment lessened bias for all methods, however providing higher type i error for sbc and ofm. In the real case, all methods provided similar att estimates except for one outcome. Our findings suggest that for sample sizes up to n = 200, opm and iptw are to be preferred to ofm and sbc in estimating att on hrqol outcomes. Specifically, opm performed best in sample sizes of n ≥ 80, iptw for smaller sample sizes. Additional mlr adjustment can further improve att estimates.",30784132

For statin-prescribed patients, we calculated a prescription window covering the anticipated duration of the prescription. For each statin-prescribed patient with at least one blood sample in a prescription window, we selected without replacement a never-statin-prescribed patient matched on sex, age, and calendar year of surgery. Each of the selected blood samples were analyzed using assays to detect statins. We calculated the positive and negative predictive value of the prescription registry reporting using the assay result as the gold standard. We identified 73 ever-statin-prescribed patients with a total of 253 blood samples and 74 blood samples among never-statin-prescribed patients. The positive predictive value for prescribed patients, with presence of statins in at least one blood sample as the gold standard, was 93% (95% ci, 86%-97%) and the negative predictive value was 93% (95% ci, 86%-97%). Stratified results did not reveal substantial differences in predictive values. Fifty-two (71%) of the statin-prescribed patients had statins in every blood sample, suggesting continuous adherence.

The safety profile of these medications is not firmly established, and concerns have been raised about their potential carcinogenicity. The objective of our study was to produce new evidence on the effect of incretin-based medications on cancer risk in patients with dm2. We conducted a ""retrospective cohort"" study with data from the clinical practice research datalink and the hospital episodes statistics in the uk. New users of either an incretin-based medication (n = 18 885) or a sulfonylurea medication (n = 36 929) between 2007 and 2013 were identified and followed for up to 8 years. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the quasi-intention-to-treat and quasi-per-protocol hazard-ratios for the association between incretin-based medications with cancer while adjusting for potential confounders. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for use of incretin-based medications versus use of sulfonylurea medications for the overall-cancer outcome was 0.97 (0.90, 1.05) in the quasi-intention-to-treat analysis and 0.90 (0.81, 1.00) in the quasi-per-protocol analysis. In both analyses, the hazard-ratio functions over the 8-year follow-up seemed fairly constant, and the 8-year cumulative-risk functions in the two subcohorts were similar. Our study suggests that the use of incretin-based medications in patients with dm2 does not increase the risk of cancer relative to the use of sulfonylurea medications, at least in the first several years of the use. Further research is needed to assess long-term effects of the use of incretin-based medications on cancer risk.",30779266

The reports were grouped according to the following age spans: 0 to 27 days; 28 days to 23 months; 2 to 11 years; and 12 to 17 years. Vigirank, a data-driven predictive model for emerging safety signals, was used to prioritise the list of drug events by age groups. The list was manually assessed, and potential signals were identified to undergo in-depth assessment to determine whether a signal should be communicated. A total of 472 drug-event pairs by paediatric age groups were the subject of an initial manual assessment. Twenty-seven drug events from the two older age groups were classified as potential signals. An in-depth assessment resulted in eight signals, of which one concerned harm in connection with off-label use of dextromethorphan and another with accidental overdose of olanzapine by young children, and the remaining signals referred to potentially new causal associations for atomoxetine (two signals), temozolamide, deferasirox, levetiracetam, and desloratadine that could be relevant also for adults. Clinically relevant signals were uncovered in vigibase by using vigirank applied to paediatric age groups.

We performed a systematic review of studies that examined methods to assess medications in use at a specific point in time. Comprehensive literature search to identify studies that compared active medications identified using pharmacy databases to medications identified using nonautomated data sources. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text material. Of 496 studies screened, 29 studies evaluating 50 comparisons met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine comparisons evaluated fixed look-back period approaches, defining active medications as those filled in a specified period prior to the index date (range 84-730 days). Fourteen comparisons evaluated medication-on-hand approaches, defining active medications as those for which the most recent fill provided sufficient supply to last through the study index date. Sensitivity ranged from 48% to 93% for fixed look-back period approaches and 35% to 97% for medication-on-hand approaches. Interpretation of comparative performance of methods was limited by use of different reference sources, target medication classes, and databases across studies. In four studies with head-to-head comparisons of these methods, sensitivity of the medication-on-hand approach was a median of 7% lower than the corresponding fixed look-back approach. The reported accuracy of methods for identifying active medications using pharmacy databases differs greatly across studies. More direct comparisons of common approaches are needed to establish the accuracy of methods within and across populations, medication classes, and databases.",30761662

A cross-sectional study of a nationwide sample of patients with anticholinergic/sedative medications dispensed by 1779 community pharmacies in the netherlands (90% of all community pharmacies) in november 2016 was conducted. Patients aged older than 65 years with a high anticholinergic/sedative load defined as having a drug burden index (dbi) greater than 1 were included. Proportion of patients with a high anticholinergic/sedative load was calculated by dividing the number of individuals in our study population by the 2.4 million older patients using medications dispensed from study pharmacies. Patient subgroups based on type of cns-active medications used were identified with latent class analysis. Overall, 8.7% (209 472 individuals) of older adults using medications had a dbi greater than 1.

Measures of length of treatment, time to first ecg, number of ecgs, and time between ecgs were assessed. We also assessed concomitant use of contraception among female users of mycophenolate per label recommendations (concomitancy 4 weeks before through 6 weeks after discontinuation of mycophenolate). Unadjusted results were stratified by age, month-year, and sex. We identified 21 457 new episodes of dronedarone use of greater than or equal to 90 days (july 2009 to september 2015); 86% had greater than or equal to one ecg, and 22% met the recommendation of an ecg no less often than every 3 months.

Drug use in a community sample of adults with ids (n = 593) was compared with dispensed drugs in a time-, age-, and region-matched comparison group of adults in western norway (n = 289 325). A logistic regression model was employed by using the main group effect to describe and analyze the differences between the id sample and the comparison sample and by using the interaction term (group × age) to describe the rate change differences from the reference age (18-30 years) between the two groups. Total drug use in the id sample was 62% compared with 50% in the reference sample (p = 0.0001). The high prevalence of drugs for the nervous system (atc n) in the id sample (50%) explained the difference. From age 51 and over, the increase in the drug use rate for the cardiovascular disease was significantly lower in the id sample than in the reference sample (p value range: 0.002-0.019).

It has been previously demonstrated that utilizing information from an internal randomly selected validation sample can help mitigate this bias. Using a monte carlo simulation-based approach, we study the properties of misclassification bias-adjusted odds-ratio estimators in a contingency table setting. We consider two methods of internal validation sampling; namely, simple random sampling and sampling conditional on the original (possibly incorrect) outcome status. Additional simulation studies are conducted to investigate these sampling approaches in a multi-table setting. We demonstrate that conditional validation sampling, across a range of subsampling fractions, can produce better estimates than those based on an unconditional simple random sample. This approach allows for greater flexibility in the chosen categorical composition of the validation data, as well as the potential for obtaining a more efficient estimator of the odds-ratio. We further demonstrate that this relationship holds for the mantel-haenszel misclassification bias-adjusted odds-ratio in stratified samples. Recommendations for the choice of validation subsampling fraction are also provided. Careful consideration when choosing the sampling scheme used to draw internal validation samples can improve the properties of the outcome misclassification bias-adjusted odds-ratio estimator in a (multiple) contingency table.",30746841

Following extraction of one year of clozapine related errors from the nrls, a qualitative analysis (thematic analysis and re-classification) and quantitative analysis was performed. An incident was considered a clozapine error if there was a failure in its medication process (i.e. An error in the prescribing, dispensing, preparing, administering, monitoring or advising of clozapine). ""issues with stock/supply/ordering"" was the most common theme derived from the qualitative thematic analysis (n = 338), followed by wrong dose/strength/frequency (n = 221) and medication omissions (n = 202). Most errors occurred in the ""administration/supply"" medication stage. Over half of reported clozapine incidents involved people 26 to 55 years old (n = 830) and 82% of errors were reported by mental health services (n = 1270). Only 1.5% of reports were classed as moderate/severe harm. Issues with availability, stock, and supply were found to be the most common causes. This usually entailed a lack of stock to fulfil a patient's dose/supply. Such incidents could potentially be reduced by improved management of the supply process, and liaison between pharmacy and clinical staff. The implementation of emergency drug cupboards at the discretion of an on-call pharmacist may prove to be a preventative measure for such errors. Despite the potential adverse effects associated with clozapine, very few incidents led to moderate/severe harm.

The exposure of studied drugs was categorized into five exclusive categories: dpp-4 inhibitor, tzd, acarbose, combined use, or non-use, and assessed in a time-varying manner. Time-dependent cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between dpp-4 inhibitors and the risk of arthralgia. Particularly, we tested the impact of different cumulative duration, timing, and individual substance of dpp-4 inhibitors use on risk of arthralgia. A corresponding nested case-control study using conditional logistic regression was conducted to verify this association. An increased risk of arthralgia was observed during the first year after initiating dpp-4 inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.35; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.04-1.75) but the risk declined with cumulative use. This duration-response relation was not found in tzds use and acarbose use. In the nested case-control study, there was a slightly increased risk of arthralgia (aor = 1.08; 95% ci, 1.04-1.12) associated with current dpp-4 inhibitor use.

In 31 068 adult participants of the national survey on drug use and health (nsduh) 2015 and 2016 who reported using opioids in the past year, we assessed the prevalence and correlates of self-reported misuse of prescribed opioids, defined as using a larger dose, more frequently, or longer than prescribed. Multivariable logistic-regression models and the machine-learning method of boosted regression were used to identify the correlates of misuse. On the basis of weighted nsduh estimates, of more than 89 million us adults who used prescription opioids every year, close to 3.9 million (4.4%) reported misused the prescribed medications. Prescribed-opioid misuse was most strongly associated with co-occurring misuse of opioids without a prescription, misuse of benzodiazepines, other drug-use disorders, history of illegal activity, and psychological distress. Misuse of prescribed opioids was also strongly associated with prescription opioid-use disorder, especially among those who misused more potent opioids or started misusing opioids before the current year. Misuse of prescribed opioids is associated with other high-risk behaviors and adverse health outcomes. The findings call for better monitoring of opioid prescription in clinical practice.",30723973

The validity of these studies is contingent upon accurate case identification. Our objective was to develop and evaluate algorithms to use with administrative data to identify multiple myeloma cases. Patients aged ≥18 years with ≥1 international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (icd-9-cm) code for multiple myeloma (203.0x) were identified at two study sites. At site 1, several algorithms were developed and validated by comparing results to tumor registry cases. An algorithm with a reasonable positive predictive value (ppv) (0.81) and sensitivity (0.73) was selected and then validated at site 2 where results were compared with medical chart data. The algorithm required that icd-9-cm codes 203.0x occur before and after the diagnostic procedure codes for multiple myeloma. At site 1, we identified 1432 patients. The ppvs of algorithms tested ranged from 0.54 to 0.88. Sensitivities ranged from 0.30 to 0.88. At site 2, a random sample (n = 400) was selected from 3866 patients, and medical charts were reviewed by a clinician for 105 patients. Algorithm ppv was 0.86 (95% ci, 0.79-0.92). We identified cases of multiple myeloma with adequate validity for claims database analyses.

Previous evaluations of abuse in the community have relied on population averaged interrupted time series poisson models with utilization offsets. However, competing interventions and secular trends complicate interpretation of time-series analyses. An alternative research design, trend-in-trend, accounts for heterogeneity in per capita opioid dispensing and unmeasured time-varying confounding, which provides a causal evaluation, provided that underlying assumptions are met. Trend-in-trend can be modeled using a logistic regression framework. In logistic regression, exposure was any product-specific outpatient dispensing by three-digit zip code and calendar quarter, for 22 opioids. The outcome was any product-specific abuse case ascertained from poison centers and drug treatment programs, covering 94% of the us population, between july 2009 and december 2016. Product-specific odds ratios compared places without dispensing with places with any dispensing; the causal contrast represents the odds of product-specific abuse in the community given exposure. Dispensing of new and low-volume opioids varied considerably across the country, with no region showing high of all products. Of 22 opioids analyzed, the three with approved labeling as intended to deter abuse ranked near the lowest in both absolute (population-adjusted rates: 1.7, 0.9, and 8.2 per million people per quarter, respectively) and relative measures (trend-in-trend ors: 1.96, 1.79, 1.69, respectively).

A further objective was to compare differences in incriminated drugs and characteristics between validated cases and a reference excluding anaphylactic reaction cases (basic dataset). Spontaneous reports of anaphylactic reactions in children (0-17 years) registered between january 2000 to december 2016 were extracted from the adverse drug reaction database of the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices. These reports were restricted to drugs for which at least four cases were found. After case validation, 159 reports remained (validated dataset) and were compared with the basic dataset (n = 12.168 reports) using inferential statistics. Estimated yearly increase of reports (36.8 vs 0.1), most frequently incriminated drugs (antibiotics 30.2% vs 11%, analgesics/antipyretics 22.0% vs 5.6%; p values less than 0.001) and route of administration (38.4% vs 6.7%) differed between the validated dataset and the basic dataset. Validated cases differed in severity (higher with atracurium), reported symptoms (urticaria leading with analgesics), and associated factors (atopy/allergy rarely reported with antibiotics) depending on the incriminated drug class. In 13.8% (11.3% if excluding repeated readministration in one person) of the cases, the drug had not been tolerated before. A heterogeneous clinical phenotype with differences in associated factors was observed, suggesting different underlying mechanisms triggered by the different drug groups.

We examined initial migraine treatment patterns and associated patient characteristics in denmark. We used population-based health databases to assemble a nationwide cohort of adult migraine patients in 2005 to 2013. Migraine was defined as a first hospital diagnosis of migraine or a second redeemed outpatient prescription for triptans, ergots, pizotifen, or flunarizine. We classified the initial migraine treatment received after migraine onset as ""no treatment,"" ""acute only,"" ""prophylactic only,"" and ""both acute and prophylactic"" and described distributions of sex, age, comorbidities, and comedications. Among 97 431 migraine patients (78% women, median age of 41 y [interquartile range of 32-50 y]), the initial migraine treatments received were ""acute only"" (88.2%), ""prophylactic only"" (1.9%), and ""both acute and prophylactic"" (5.2%) whereas 4.6% had no record of treatment. Initiators of prophylactic treatment-with or without acute treatment-were less likely than initiators of acute treatment to be women (71% and 77% versus 79%), were older (median ages: 45 and 44 y versus 41 y), and had more comorbidities (including hypertension [31% and 24% versus 7%] and diabetes [6% and 5% versus 3%]). Nonpersistence with initial prophylactic treatment was common: within the first year, 35% of initiators stopped therapy fully, 50% stopped and restarted, and 15% switched drugs. For 88% of patients with incident migraine, the initial migraine treatment was acute treatment only.

However, as antidepressants are frequently prescribed for indications other than depression, this is likely to result in misclassification. This study aimed to develop a predictive algorithm that identifies patients using antidepressants for the treatment of depression. Pharmaceutical benefits scheme (pbs) and medicare benefits schedule (mbs) claims data were linked to follow-up questionnaires (completed in 2012-2013) for participants of the 45 and up study-a cohort study of residents of new south wales, australia, aged 45 years and older. The sample composed participants who were dispensed an antidepressant in the 30 days prior to questionnaire completion (n = 3162). An algorithm based on patient characteristics, pharmaceutical dispensings, and claims for mental health services was built using group-lasso interaction network (glinternet), with self-reported receipt of treatment for depression as the outcome. The predictive performance of the algorithm was assessed via bootstrap resampling. The algorithm composes 15 main effects and 11 interactions, with type of antidepressant dispensed and claims for mental health services the strongest predictors. The ability of the algorithm to discriminate between antidepressant users with and without depression was 0.73. At a predicted probability cut-off of 0.6, specificity was 93.8% and sensitivity was 23.6%. Using this algorithm with a high probability cut-off yields high specificity and facilitates the exclusion of individuals using antidepressants for indications other than depression, thereby mitigating the risk of confounding by indication when evaluating the outcomes of antidepressant use.",30680859

We describe the identification and validation of a retrospective cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes (t2dm) from four pcornet sites. We adapted existing computable phenotypes (cp) for the identification of patients with t2dm and evaluated their performance across four pcornet sites (2012-2016). Patients entered the cohort on the earliest date they met one of three cp categories: (cp1) coded t2dm diagnosis (icd-9/icd-10) and an antidiabetic prescription, (cp2) diagnosis and glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) ≥6.5%, or (cp3) an antidiabetic prescription and hba1c ≥6.5%. We required evidence of health care utilization in each of the 2 prior years for each patient, as we also developed an incident t2dm cp to identify the subset of patients without documentation of t2dm in the 365 days before t  . Among a systematic sample of patients, we calculated the positive predictive value (ppv) for the t2dm cp and incident-t2dm cp using electronic health record (ehr) review as reference. The cp identified 50 657 patients with t2dm. The ppv of patients randomly selected for validation was 96.2% (n = 1572; ci:95.1-97.0) and was consistently high across sites. The ppv for the incident-t2dm cp was 5.8% (ci:4.5-7.5). The t2dm cp accurately and efficiently identified patients with t2dm across multiple sites that participate in pcornet, although the incident t2dm cp requires further study. Pcornet is a valuable data source for future epidemiological and comparative effectiveness research among patients with t2dm.",30680840

Algorithms were developed based on clinical insight, published literature, and quantitative approaches. The actual dm type was ascertained via chart review. Finally, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv) were evaluated. Among the 400 patients, mean age was 14.2 (±2.5 years), and 50% were female. The best performing algorithms were based on data available in claims. They consisted of several logical expressions based on one predictor or more, which classified patients by use of glucose-lowering drugs or testing, dm icd-9 diagnosis codes, and comorbidities. The best performing t2dm and t1dm algorithms achieved 90% and 98% sensitivity, 95% and 95% specificity, 87% and 98% ppv, and 96% and 96% npv, respectively.

The search strategy included synonyms for ""dementia"", ""europe"", and ""ehr"". Studies were included if they validated dementia diagnoses in uk primary care or hospitalisation databases, irrespective of validation method used. The quality assessment for diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (quadas-2) tool was used to assess risk of bias. From 1469 unique records, 14 relevant studies were included. Thirteen validated individual diagnoses against a reference standard, reporting high estimates of validity. Most reported only the positive predictive value (ppv), with estimates ranging between 0.09 and 1.0 and 0.62 and 0.85 in primary care and hospitalisation databases, respectively. One study performed a rate comparison, indicating good generalisability of dementia diagnoses in the health improvement network (thin) database to the uk population. Studies were of low methodological quality. As studies were not comparable, no summary validity estimates were produced. While heterogenous across studies, reported validity estimates were generally high. However, the credibility of these estimates is limited by the methodological quality of studies, primarily resulting from insufficient blinding of researchers interpreting the reference test. Inadequate reporting, particularly of the specific codes validated, hindered comparison of estimates across studies.

The national health insurance research database (nhird) which covers over 99.9% of the taiwanese population served as the comparator in this study. We compare the data components of the cgrd with the nhird, including records for health care facilities, patients, diagnoses, drugs, and procedures. Using the chi-square test, we compared the distributions of age categories and sex of patients, and the rates of their health conditions between nhird and cgrd based on the year 2015. The cgrd contains more clinical information such as pathological and laboratory results than the nhird. The cgrd includes 6.1% of outpatients and 10.2% of hospitalized patients from the nhird. We found the cgrd includes more elderly outpatients (23.5% vs 12.5%) and pediatric inpatients (19.7% vs 14.4%) compared with the nhird. We found patients' sex distributions were similar between cgrd and nhird, but coverage rates of severe conditions, such as cancer, were higher than other health conditions in cgrd.

Distributed networks are efficient, by interrogating data on very large populations. The structure of these networks can also be leveraged to improve replicability, increase transparency, and reduce bias. We describe some features of distributed networks using, as examples, the canadian network for observational drug effect studies, the sentinel system in the usa, and the european research network of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. Common protocols, analysis plans, and data models, with policies on amendments and protocol violations, are key features. These tools ensure that studies can be audited and repeated as necessary. Blinding and strict conflict of interest policies reduce the potential for bias in analyses and interpretation.

Of the 21 apec countries, 15 responded. We found harmonized laws and regulations for general pv and risk management systems. However, variations were found in pv structure: for example, 11 out of 15 countries had national regulatory representatives responsible for pv in pharmaceutical companies, while four did not. For pv process, discrepancies were also found in the source type of adverse drug reaction (adr) reports and reporting of medication errors and therapeutic ineffectiveness in cumulative adr reports. With respect to pv outcomes, among countries that performed active surveillance, the united states of america was more active, with hundreds of projects including additional pharmacoepidemiological studies etc. Among the nine countries that responded, japan had the greatest number of product label changes followed by taiwan, malaysia, and korea. We have identified substantial variations in the structures, processes, and outcomes of pv status among the countries of the apec region.

Here, we present a method of restriction to an indication, which we call ""extreme restriction,"" to reduce confounding in such studies. As a case study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia (hcap). Ppi use has been associated with increased hcap risk, but this association likely results from confounding by indication due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). Using the uk's clinical practice research datalink, we compared the risk of hcap within 180 days between ppi users and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (h2ra) users in an acnu cohort using cox proportional hazard models with a time-fixed exposure definition adjusted for high-dimensional propensity score deciles. We then performed the same analysis on an ""extremely-restricted"" cohort of incident nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) users, some of whom received ppis for prophylaxis. Because ppis were given as prophylaxis in this population, confounding due to gerd should be limited. We compared effect estimates between acnu and restricted cohorts to evaluate confounding in both analyses. In the acnu cohort, ppis were associated with an increased risk of hcap (hazard ratio [hr]: 1.25; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.05, 1.47), but this association was not present in the restricted cohort (hr: 1.06; 95% ci: 0.75, 1.49).

We propose the term pharmacologically pertinent period of effect (pppe) to address this time window. We explored the pppe in light of the rofecoxib saga. We identified the observational database studies of rofecoxib at doses 25 and 50 mg daily and thromboembolic events. We also obtained the kaplan-meier curves of vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research trial (vigor) and adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx (approve) trials. We found seven observational studies with nine analyses. All the studies only looked at current exposure. At the dose of 25 mg, only three of nine analyses were barely statistically significant. At the dose of 50 mg, the risk ratios were much higher. The visual inspection of the kaplan-meier curves shows that in the approve trial (25 mg), the placebo and rofecoxib curves start separating to become statistically significantly different only after 36 months. In contrast the vigor (50 mg), curves start separating very early and the divergence increases after 8 months. The 50 mg observational studies, looking at current exposure, correctively identified the almost immediate increase in risk evident in the vigor kaplan-meier curves. The absence of an immediate increase in risk shown by the approve trial was also correctively identified by most observational 25 mg studies. To our knowledge no observational study was done on the long-term cardiac toxicity of the 25-mg dose. It would thus appear that the two doses of rofecoxib have different pppes.",30628139

Anonymised enquiry data of reported poisoning cases were reviewed for a period from 2005 to 2016 inclusive. The rate of pharmacy claims for codeine containing products was also examined using the national pharmacy claims database. Segmented regression analysis was used to detect changes in poisonings and claims before and after the new guidance. There were 1851 codeine-related poisonings reported over the study period. An annual decline was evident with a significant 33% reduction from 2010 to 2011 (β2 coefficient for level change, 42.1; 95% ci, -68.1 to -16.0; p = 0.006). Following 2011, the declining rate of codeine poisonings plateaued.

There was no corresponding increase in the reimbursement of alternative opioid medications. New guidance on codeine supply coincided with an initial reduction in reported codeine poisoning cases. This reduction was in keeping with the previous trend. However, this was without an increase in the prevailing rate of prescription claims for these products or potential substitutes.

The pubmed and embase databases were searched to identify potential studies for inclusion. Eight cohort studies that estimated adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes associated with exposure to adhd medication during pregnancy were included. Exposure to adhd medication was associated with an increased risk of neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) admission compared with no exposure at any time (risk ratio (rr) 1.88; 95% confidence interval (ci), 1.7-2.08) and compared with women with exposure either before or after pregnancy (rr 1.38; 95% ci, 1.23-1.54; p < 0.001).

However, exposure to adhd medication was not associated with an increased risk for other adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. This analysis was limited by the small number of studies included and the limited adjustments for the possible confounders in the studies.

We assessed varying levels of ppi use through record linkages to the icelandic medicines registry. For each case, we selected up to 10 age-matched, sex-matched, and calendar-matched population controls using risk-set sampling. Using conditional logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) controlling for nsaid use. Adjusted ors associated with ever use of ppis were 1.03 (95% ci: 0.92-1.16) for breast cancer, 1.12 (95% ci: 1.00-1.25) for prostate cancer, and 0.84 (95% ci: 0.69-1.12) for malignant melanoma.

Adjusted ipds in women with diabetes were 7.0 (95% ci, 6.3-7.8) and 11.9 (95% ci, 6.7-17.0) for primary and secondary prevention, respectively, and 3.1 (95% ci, 2.1-4.0) and 9.2 (95% ci 8.2-10.2) for before and after atp-iii, respectively. Secular trends reflected evolution toward risk factor-based treatment indications for statin initiation with increased initiation among diabetics and women with normal and borderline cholesterol. The role of serum cholesterol changed over time, though the character was scale (multiplicative vs additive) dependent. In pharmacoepidemiologic studies of statins, strength of confounding by important variables sometimes unmeasured in claims data, such as cholesterol level, may be calendar time dependent.",30565779

It is a rare clinical entity whose risk factors are not yet fully elucidated. A local pattern of disproportionality within a global database of suspected adverse drug reactions (adrs) revealed an increased reporting of aseptic meningitis and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (ac) in males. The aim of this report is to explore the clinical probability of a higher risk in males to support the use of statistical methods to identify subgroups at risk for adverse drug reactions. Disproportionality analysis was performed for all drug-adverse event (ae) pairs in the entire database and for the subsets of males and females. Ac-aseptic meningitis was highlighted for an increased disproportionality in the male subgroup in the absence of an elevated disproportionality measure for the database overall. A clinical review was undertaken. Clinical review revealed a similar statistical pattern of gender difference observed for amoxicillin, evidence to suggest a delayed type 4 hypersensitivity reaction with th1 cells as a mechanism for amoxicillin-aseptic meningitis, the existence of sex differences in immune responses (th1/th2), and an analogous increased risk of drug-induced liver injury by ac in males. Subgroup disproportionality analysis has revealed a larger than expected number of reports of aseptic meningitis after amoxicillin and ac in males. Evidence synthesis supports the statistical finding. Further exploration of spontaneous databases with more extensive analyses could usher in a new era of ""precision pharmacovigilance.""",30556617

All potential incident crc cases recorded during the study period 2001 to 2014 among patients 20 to 89 years old were identified using a defined case-finding algorithm tailored to bifap database characteristics and based on codes plus text mining strategies. Potential crc cases identified by the algorithm were classified into eight homogeneous groups according to recording characteristics. Random samples of 100 cases per group were obtained, and electronic medical records were manually reviewed by two independent researchers. Positive predictive values (ppvs) were estimated per each group and for the whole sample taking into account the stratified sampling. Standardized incidence rate (sir) of crc was estimated and compared with that reported by the national cancer registry. Negative predictive value (npv) was also estimated in a random sample of 100 non-crc patients by the algorithm. A total of 17 008 potential crc cases were identified. Most of them (14793; 87%) were recorded as incident diagnosis with linked clinical notes as free text, having this group a ppv of 92.1% (95%ci: 87.1%-95.3%). The overall ppv including all groups was 87.3% (95%ci: 83.3%-90.4%). Sir of crc was 55.5 per 100.000 person-years. Sir increased with age and was higher in men as compared with women (77.7 vs 38.1 per 100.000 py, respectively) which were in line with those reported by the network of cancer registries in spain. Npv was of 100% (96.3%-100%). This study shows a high validity of the crc cases identified by the algorithm and a high level of crc recording in bifap database and supports its appropriateness to validly identify incident crc cases in bifap.",30548462

Tramadol is an atypical prescription-only (but unscheduled under canada's narcotics law) opioid analgesic and not subject to controls for other (eg, strong) opioids. Given experiences in different jurisdictions, tramadol may have been increasingly dispensed as a ""substitute"" drug during a period with increasingly restrictive controls for other (scheduled) opioids. We examined the annual population-level retail dispensing (as a proxy for use) of tramadol and (scheduled) ""strong opioids"" in canadian provinces for 2007-2016 based on data from a representative national sample of community pharmacies, covering the majority of episodes of opioid dispensing. Data for both aforementioned formulation categories were converted into defined daily doses (ddd)/1000 population/day and examined descriptively and by segmented regression analyses (to identify significant breakpoints in trends). Tramadol use strongly increased in all provinces until 2009. After 2009, tramadol dispensing levels either decelerated their increase or plateaued; ""strong opioid"" dispensing levels, in comparison, increased strongly until 2011 and decelerated or decreased for the remaining period. Tramadol was consistently dispensed at lower levels than ""strong opioids."" tramadol and ""strong opioids"" showed similar (bifurcated) use trends, with initial increases and subsequent inflections, yet reductions in dispensing occurred earlier for tramadol than for ""strong opioids"" (the latter occurring following with recent interventions). Distinct from experiences with differential opioid control regimes elsewhere, there is no evidence that tramadol figured as a ""substitution"" drug for increasingly restricted ""strong opioids"" in canada.",30548353

Sensitivity and specificity of postsurgery vte among patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement (thr/tkr) were assessed against chart review in six montreal hospitals in 2009 to 2010. Administrative data on all thr/tkr quebec patients in 2009 to 2010 were obtained. The performance of bayesian external, bayesian internal, and mi approaches to correct the odds ratio (or) of postsurgery vte in tertiary versus community hospitals was assessed using simulations. Bayesian external approach used prior information from external sources, while bayesian internal and mi approaches used chart review. In total, 17 319 patients were included, 2136 in participating hospitals, among whom 75 had vte in administrative data versus 81 in chart review. Vte sensitivity was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.69) and specificity was 0.99 (0.98-0.99), overall. The adjusted or of vte in tertiary versus community hospitals was 1.35 (1.12-1.64) using administrative data, 1.45 (0.97-2.19) when mi was used for misclassification correction, and 1.53 (0.83-2.87) and 1.57 (0.39-5.24) when bayesian internal and external approaches were used, respectively. In simulations, all three approaches reduced the or bias and had appropriate coverage for both nondifferential and differential misclassification. Vte identified from administrative data had low sensitivity and high specificity. The bayesian external approach was useful to reduce outcome misclassification bias in logistic regression; however, it required accurate specification of the misclassification properties and should be used with caution.",30515908

In the case-control slone birth defects study, within 6 months of delivery, trained nurses conducted standardized telephone interviews with mothers of infants with and without major structural malformations. In a subset of approximately 5000 case and control mothers from five us centers (2008-2012), a research nurse abstracted subjects' medical records. Ga at delivery was calculated as date of delivery minus (estimated date of confinement [edc] minus 280); if edc was unknown, last menstrual period served as a proxy for start of pregnancy. Positive and negative predictive values (ppv and npv, respectively) were calculated, using medical records as the standard, for categories of ga at delivery (ie, early preterm <238, late preterm <258, and term ≥259 d) and birthweight (low <2500, normal 2500 to 4500, and high >4500 g). The gestational age and birthweight validation samples comprised 3122 and 4760 women, respectively, with diverse characteristics. The ppv and npv were high (>92% and >99%, respectively) for all categories of delivery ga and birthweight. Our findings suggest that mothers' recall may be a valid alternative to medical records to estimate delivery ga and birthweight. This study used standardized interviews conducted by trained research nurses, had a short recall period (<6 months post delivery), and for delivery ga, focused on date-derived ga.

As for all vaccines, a valid data source is required for research on observational effectiveness or safety. The objective of this study is to identify and validate hpv vaccinations recorded among women in the primary care database for pharmacoepidemiological research (bifap) from 2007. Bifap includes a vaccination file filled by pc practitionners and pediatricians. Information on women with hpv vaccinations recorded at any age was identified and validated according to whether (1) doses adhered to the following standard intervals: 27 to 269 days between first and second doses, >55 days between second and third doses, and <366 between first and third doses, and (2) additional information recorded in clinical records confirmed (through recording the brand, batch, expiring date, administration site, or vaccination comment) or refuted the vaccination and date. The latter was retrieved through manual review of anonymous records randomly selected. One hundred seventeen thousand seventy-three women with hpv vaccination records were identified (mean age 14.7 years); 82.5% had three jabs, 87.3% in recommended intervals. A sample of 978 patients' records, including 2245 jabs, was reviewed. Of the 363 jabs with additional information, 91% confirmed the vaccination. Confirmatory data was more frequent when doses strictly adhered to recommendations (96.8%-100%) than not (60.0%-85.7%). In bifap, a cohort of women vaccinated against hpv, mostly with three doses in recommended intervals, was identified. Although additional information about the vaccination was scarce, when present, it highly confirmed it, making bifap a potential data source for hpv vaccine research.",30488510

We aimed to elucidate the factors affecting drug selection by describing the actual situation of chemoradiotherapy for hnc in japan and the transition in treatment selection before and after the approval of cetuximab. We used a claims database involving multiple hospitals nationwide. The study included patients diagnosed with hnc between april 2008 and august 2015 who underwent chemoradiotherapy. The anticancer drugs used were categorized into four groups, namely, cetuximab, cisplatin, other platinum agents, and other agents. After assessing patient background and transition in concomitant drugs, we performed multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine factors that affect patient drug selection. This study analyzed 2777 patients whose median age was 66 years. A cisplatin-based regimen remained the most commonly used concomitant drug even after cetuximab approval. In multinomial logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (ci) in terms of age (66 y or older vs less than 65 y) relative to the cisplatin group were 3.01 (95% ci, 2.26-4.02) for the cetuximab group; 1.76 (95% ci, 1.22-2.48) for the other platinum agent group; and 3.09 (95% ci, 2.39-3.99) for the other agent group.

However, few studies have investigated statin use and survival in gastric cancer. We investigated statin use and survival in two large population-based gastric cancer cohorts. Patients diagnosed with gastric cancer from 1998 to 2012 were identified from english and scottish cancer registries. Statin prescriptions were identified from linkages to the uk clinical practice research datalink in england and the prescribing information system in scotland, and deaths identified from national mortality records. Time-dependent cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for cancer-specific mortality by statin use in multivariate analysis. Meta-analysis techniques pooled results across the cohorts. The combined cohorts contained 3833 patients with gastric cancer and 2392 cancer-specific deaths. Statin use after diagnosis was associated with reduced cancer-specific mortality (adjusted hr 0.83; 95% ci, 0.74-0.92).

Furthermore, it is unknown whether gastrointestinal complaints occur more frequently in dabigatran users compared with other direct oral anticoagulant (doacs) users. We investigated the association between doac use (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) and subsequent ppi initiation as a proxy for gastrointestinal complaints. In this population-based observational study with an active-comparator new user study design, anonymised dispensing data from community pharmacies in the netherlands from 2012 to 2016 were used. Patients initiating doac for the treatment of atrial fibrillation without any ppi use before or at time of doac initiation were included. The outcome measure, subsequent ppi initiation, was determined in 28553 doac users. The patients initiating dabigatran (10 942), apixaban (4897), or rivaroxaban (12714) were comparable for age (mean 69 years), sex (62% men), socioeconomic class, and concomitant medication use.

We identified pregnancies among women aged 15 to 54 years between 01/01/2004 and 09/30/2015 from 16 health plans participating in sentinel. We inferred indication using icd-9-cm codes in the 183-day period before conception. We assessed proportion of infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab by calendar year, indication, and maternal age, and compared them to proportions in an age-matched, indication-matched, and date-matched non-pregnant cohort. Among 19 681 pregnancies with at least one chronic inflammatory condition, 2990 (15.2%) received a tnfi. In both pregnancies and matched non-pregnant cohort, tnfi use was highest (34.4%; 55.8%) for psa patients and lowest (6.2%; 13.4%) for pso patients. Etanercept was most frequently used among as/jia/psa/pso/ra patients, while infliximab was the preferred tnfi for cd/uc patients. Except for infliximab and certolizumab, tnfi use during pregnancy decreased after the first trimester. Pregnancies among older pregnant women (45-54 years) were more likely to be treated compared with the matched non-pregnant cohort. There was a preference for etanercept among pregnancies with as/jia/psa/pso/ra, despite the availability of other tnfis. Decline in tnfi use after the first trimester may be related to the desire to reduce tnfis transplacental transfer and to minimize infection risk to the fetus or baby associated with live vaccine immunizations after birth.",30430682

Results were stratified by data partner, sex, age group, and calendar year and compared with national estimates from centers for disease control and prevention wide-ranging online data for epidemiologic research. We performed sample size estimations for all-cause mortality and 10 leading causes of death. We observed 479 694 deaths, including 5811 suicides, during 68 million person-years of follow-up. Pooled mean death and suicide rates in the data partners were 710 and 8.6 per 100 000 person-years, respectively (vs 810 and 11.8 nationally). The mean proportional mortality from suicide among the data partners was 1.2%, compared with 1.5% nationally. National trends of decreasing overall mortality and increasing proportional mortality for suicide were reflected within sentinel. We estimated that detecting hazard ratios of 1.25 and 3 would require 16 442 and 460 exposed patients, respectively, for overall mortality, and 1.3 million and 37 411, respectively, for suicide. This was the first study to investigate mortality data in the sentinel death tables.

A subset (n = 231) of treatment-seeking opioid users from a national opioid surveillance system, participating in the researchers and participants interacting directly (rapid) program, completed an online survey centered on multi-pill use. Over two-thirds of non-medical prescription opioid users had a history of multi-pill use (67.7%), defined as ingesting four or more of the same pill, intact and at the same time. Among these (n = 154), the median maximum number of pills taken at one time was eight, with over 20% ingesting 11 or more pills in a single instance.

This study was performed in two university hospitals, comparing recorded discharge diagnoses and electronic health records (ehrs). Patients with discharge icd-10 codes 150.x were randomly selected. Their ehrs were reviewed to classify hf diagnosis as definite, potential, or miscoded based on the european society of cardiology diagnostic criteria, from which the codes' positive predictive value (ppv) was computed. To estimate sensitivity, patients with an ehr hf diagnosis were identified, and the presence of the i50.x codes was sought for in the hospital discharge database. Two hundred possible cases of hf were selected from the hospital discharge database, and 229 patients with an hf diagnosis were identified from the ehr.

Pregnancies conceived between january 2005 and march 2015 were identified in the national maternity collection, the national minimum dataset, the mortality collection, and the laboratory claims collection. Pregnancy start and end dates were calculated and used in conjunction with the national health index number to merge the records from the four collections to create the new zealand pregnancy cohort. Records of live born and stillborn infants identified in the national maternity collection and the mortality collection that were linkable with a cohort member formed the baby cohort. The cohort consists of 941 468 pregnancies to 491 272 women. One-third of the pregnancies, predominantly early pregnancy losses and terminations, were not found in the national maternity collection. Records of 632 090 live born or stillborn infants are linked with 623 099 pregnancies. The new zealand pregnancy cohort is a comprehensive collection of virtually all pregnancies which ended in a live or stillbirth and many, though not all, which ended as early pregnancy losses or terminations in new zealand over the past decade, and better represents the pregnant population than a cohort generated from the national maternity collection alone would do. This cohort will be valuable for investigating patterns of medicine use during pregnancy in new zealand and developing a fuller understanding of potential impacts of foetal exposure in early pregnancy.",30394649

The purpose of this study is to identify the proportion of new fts users who had evidence of prior opioid tolerance, by dosage strength, in fda's sentinel system. We identified new fts episodes (183-day washout) from 2009 through 2013. Members were <65 years and enrolled in medical and pharmacy coverage for 183 days prior to initial fts dispensing (index). We assessed the proportion of users with prior tolerance stratified by dosage strength of fts using four definitions of opioid tolerance: ≥30-mg oxycodone equivalents/day in each of 7 consecutive days immediately prior to index; ≥30-mg oxycodone equivalents/day for any 7 days in the 30 days prior to index (secondary); any dose in each of 7 days in the 7 consecutive days immediately prior to index (tertiary); and any dose for any 7 days in the 30 days prior to index (quaternary). Of 44 450 episodes of 25 mcg/hr fts, 37% met the primary definition, and 77% met the quaternary definition. Of 3507 episodes of 100 mcg/hr fts, 57% and 74% met the primary and quaternary definitions, respectively. Those aged 25 to 34 years had the highest proportion of episodes with prior tolerance; those aged 55 to 64 accounted for more of the episodes overall. In sentinel, many new users of fts did not have evidence of prior opioid tolerance by the primary definition, ie, the product label definition, which is the minimum standard for the lowest fts dose (12 mcg/hr), especially at the highest strength (100 mcg/hr). Validation of this metric is warranted, but our findings suggest the need for further prescriber education regarding appropriate prescribing of fts.",30379379

The objective of this study was to describe pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to cancer chemotherapy, recorded in the french terappel database. We performed a descriptive, prospective study of the pregnancies of women exposed to cancer chemotherapy recorded in terappel between june 1984 and december 2016. Terappel is a french database that has recorded questions of health professionals and/or individuals at the regional pharmacovigilance centres about drugs and pregnancy. For each question, pregnancies are monitored and the outcome is recorded in the database. In total, 75 questions about ""anti-cancer drugs and pregnancy"" received by 16 regional pharmacovigilance centres between 1997 and 2016 were recorded in terappel. Breast cancer accounted for 62.7% of the cases, followed by leukaemia (13.3%) and lymphoma (9.3%). Cyclophosphamide is the leading anti-cancer drug with 40.0% of exposed pregnant women, followed by 5-fluorouracil (34.7%), epirubicin (32.0%), tamoxifen (26.7%), and doxorubicin (16.0%). Among the 75 pregnancies, we observed 55 births with 57 children (73.3%) (two cases of twins), nine medical terminations of pregnancy (12.0%), six voluntary terminations of pregnancy (8.0%), three intrauterine foetal deaths (4.0%), and two miscarriages (2.7%). We found a malformation rate of 7.8%. Sixteen of 57 (28.1%) newborns developed one or more neonatal pathologies. Pregnancy of women taking anti-cancer drugs resulted in birth in 73% of cases.

Outcomes of interest included (1) a composite effectiveness endpoint including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or inpatient mortality; (2) a composite safety endpoint including major bleeding events requiring hospitalization; and (3) pneumonia hospitalizations as a negative control endpoint. We used calendar time-specific propensity score matching to account for confounding and applied cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (hr) with 95% confidence intervals (ci). Comparative risk of the effectiveness endpoint was lower among prasugrel initiators compared to clopidogrel initiators (hr 0.82, 95% ci 0.68-0.99, n = 7011 matched pairs), but no different between ticagrelor and clopidogrel (hr 1.02, 95% ci 0.76-1.37, n = 3013 pairs) or prasugrel and ticagrelor (hr 0.83, 95% ci 0.58-1.18, n = 2207 pairs). Bleeding risk was higher among prasugrel initiators when compared to clopidogrel initiators within the first month of treatment (hr 1.85, 95% ci 1.03-3.35); no other comparison indicated any difference. No differences in the negative control outcomes were noted after ps matching for all comparisons, indicating adequate confounding control. Prasugrel was associated with superior cardiovascular outcomes and a higher risk of short-term bleeding compared to clopidogrel in patients with acs and dm.

Data regarding general information and study methods including statistical analysis were extracted. Study quality was assessed using newcastle-ottawa scale (nos). Investigated drugs were ranked and compared with data on the prevalence of pediatric drug use. Three thousand nine hundred twenty-six abstracts were screened for eligibility and inclusion, and 164 articles were included in the review. Most studies were from north america (46.7%).

We examined concordance by provider specialty and provider identifier between (a) the first antidepressant prescription fill and most proximal depression diagnosis, and (b) the initial antidepressant and benzodiazepine prescription fills among simultaneous benzodiazepine and antidepressant initiators. Among 245 166 antidepressant initiators with a recent depression diagnosis (female = 67%; median age = 39), the specialty of the provider assigning the depression diagnosis matched the antidepressant prescriber's specialty in 94% of cases with known provider details (provider identifier concordance = 93%). Concordance was higher for adults diagnosed by a general practitioner (98%) or psychiatrist (92%) than for those diagnosed by a psychologist (74%). In simultaneous new users of antidepressants and benzodiazepines (n = 19 371), both prescriptions were issued by the same provider specialty and provider identifier 94% and 93% of the time, respectively. The vast majority of patients who received antidepressant prescriptions and depression diagnoses appear to have received both diagnosis and antidepressants from the same provider, suggesting that when antidepressants are issued around the time a patient is diagnosed with depression, the antidepressant was likely prescribed for depression. In addition, the great majority of patients who simultaneously initiate benzodiazepines appear to do so under the direction of one provider.",30379369

Risk minimization measure (rmm) was communicated to physicians. The survey presented here evaluated effectiveness of the rmm and assessed physicians knowledge and compliance with rmm. It also analyzed actual prescribing pattern of tmz. A cross sectional, web-based survey was developed and conducted among prescribing physicians of tmz across 12 european countries. Physicians' samples were weighted to account for the actual proportion of specialties within and across countries. Using weighted samples, data from 1123 physicians and 8332 prescriptions were analyzed. Most (74.0%) of the physicians assumed stable angina pectoris to be an indication for tmz. Three quarter of (75.7%) of these physicians were aware of the approved indication. Vertigo (62.1%), tinnitus (42.5%), declined visual acuity, and visual field disturbances (45.1%) were also presumed to be approved indications for tmz, and physicians actually prescribed for these indications. Only 29.8% of the physicians remembered receiving rmm communications regarding tmz. Most (90.5%) of the physicians expressed their interest to know and comply with the safety communications.

The objective of this study was to quantify the inflation of type i error rates that can result from differential outcome misclassification. We used data on gold-standard and ehr-derived second breast cancers in a cohort of women with a prior breast cancer diagnosis from 1993 to 2006 enrolled in kaiser permanente washington. We simulated an exposure that was independent of the true outcome status. A surrogate outcome was then simulated with varying sensitivity and specificity according to exposure status. We estimated the type i error rate for a test of association relating this exposure to the surrogate outcome, while varying outcome sensitivity and specificity in exposed individuals. Type i error rates were substantially inflated above the nominal level (5%) for even modest departures from nondifferential misclassification. Holding sensitivity in exposed and unexposed groups at 85%, a difference in specificity of 10% between the exposed and unexposed (80% vs 90%) resulted in a 36% type i error rate. Type i error was inflated more by differential specificity than sensitivity. Differential outcome misclassification may induce spurious findings. Researchers using ehr-derived outcomes should use misclassification-adjusted methods whenever possible or conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the possibility of false-positive findings, especially for exposures that may be related to the accuracy of outcome ascertainment.",30375122

An extract of all patients aged over 65 years, with a read code for hip osteoarthritis listed between january 1995 and december 2014, was obtained from cprd. A random sample was selected of 170 participants. A questionnaire concerning data in medical records on relevant clinical and radiographic criteria used to establish the diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis was distributed to primary care physicians of participants. Using diagnostic criteria, we formulated thresholds for diagnosis based on clinical, radiographic, and combined grounds. One hundred nineteen completed questionnaires were returned (70% response rate). The positive predictive value (ppv) of hip osteoarthritis codes, based on radiological criteria, was 79.8%. The ppv, based on clinical criteria, was 79.0%, with substantial but not complete overlap. Overall 12% of diagnoses were not confirmed. In 42% of cases, there was disparity between date of diagnosis in cprd and the medical record. Median difference in date was ±425 days (interquartile range, 18-1448 days).

In the any diagnosis approach, cases were defined by primary or secondary diagnostic codes for pancreatic cancer in outpatient or inpatient records. In the any inpatient diagnosis approach, cases were defined using only diagnoses in hospital discharge abstracts. In the algorithm approach, cases were identified by an algorithm that combined the first two approaches. Comparing each approach to the ocr, we calculated the expected value and 95% confidence interval (ci) of the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv). We also compared the event dates using each approach with those recorded in the ocr. Among a total of 12 060 837 patients in ontario administrative health data sources, 13 999 incident pancreatic cancer cases were identified in the ocr. Sensitivity ranged from 72.5% (algorithm) to 97.5% (any diagnosis), and ppv ranged from 38.4% (any diagnosis) to 78.9% (any inpatient diagnosis). Specificity and npv were ~100% for all approaches.

We linked the records of 768 enrolled patients from an earlier study, where clinical pharmacists identified adrs using prospective data collection, to hospital administrative data. We identified patients in the study whose admissions were coded as adrs using icd-10-am codes. We then compared the prevalence and characteristics of adr-related hospital admissions identified by the two approaches. According to icd-10-am coding, 2.7% of patients were admitted due to adrs, while 15.0% of patients were deemed to have been admitted due to adrs based on prospective identification by clinical pharmacists. Most (85.7%) patients coded as having an adr-related hospital admission were also identified as such prospectively. Hematological (23.1%) and metabolic reactions (23.1%) were frequent causes of adrs identified by coding, whereas cardiovascular adrs (27.8%) were more common causes of adrs identified prospectively by pharmacists. Antidepressants (16.7%) and cardiac glycosides (16.7%) were the most commonly implicated drug groups in adrs identified by coding, whereas diuretics (28.8%) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (17.0%) were frequently implicated as causes of adrs identified prospectively by pharmacists. Reliance on administrative coding potentially underestimates the extent of the problem of adrs as a cause of hospitalization in the elderly, and more detailed prospective analysis of admissions provides additional targets for strategies to prevent adrs. The types of adrs identified also differ between the two approaches.",30264866

A nationwide retrospective cohort study was performed based on danish registries. Children of mothers who used β2aas during pregnancy were allocated to the exposed group and other children to the unexposed group. The outcome was a diagnosis of epilepsy. Cox regression was performed to estimate the hazard ratios (hrs) of epilepsy after adjusting for parental and children factors. To evaluate confounding by indication, we extended the exposure time window from 2 years before pregnancy and stratified the analyses by maternal asthma, in particular analyses by trimesters. The exposed children had a 1.24-fold risk of epilepsy (hr = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.12, 1.38). Compared with no prenatal exposure from 2 years before pregnancy through delivery, the hr was 1.11 (95% ci: 1.01, 1.22) in children of mothers with β2aas use only before pregnancy, 1.28 (95% ci: 1.09, 1.50) only during pregnancy, and 1.23 (95% ci: 1.07, 1.41) both before and during pregnancy. The increased risk was only observed in children of mothers with β2aas use in the first (hr = 1.33, 95% ci: 1.01, 1.75) or second trimesters (hr = 1.35, 95% ci: 1.05, 1.74), but not the third trimester. In utero exposure to β2aas, particularly in the first or second trimesters, may be associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. It may partly be due to the indication of β2aas use, but a direct effect of β2aas cannot be ruled out.",30256490

We implemented this pilot study before a national investigation to identify requests for suspected recreational use of psychoactive drugs made by young subjects to community pharmacies. Thirty-eight french community pharmacies were asked to complete questionnaire (with age, gender of subjects; name, form, quantity of drugs) for each suspect request formulated by subjects under 26. Besides, pharmacists were asked about the regulatory measures they thought useful to decrease this diverted use by young people. Nineteen pharmacies participated. The study covered from december 12, 2016 to january 23, 2017. Forty-one requests mentioning 51 drugs were reported. They concerned males (85%) aged 20 years old on average, including 6 minors. The most frequent age class was that comprised between 18 and 20 years old. Codeine-containing drugs (29 reports) and promethazine (17 reports), the main components of the popular cocktail ""purple drank,"" were the most requested, followed by dextromethorphan (3 reports). Fifteen drugs were requested in syrup form. One request concerned the prescription drug ketamine.

Pre-approval concerns toward 24 target ars were identified in the drug review reports and initial package inserts of 126 target drugs approved for use in japan between april 2004 and march 2009. Each target drug was monitored for 5 years after approval for the addition of these ars as clinically significant adverse reactions (csars) in the package inserts. Positive predictive values (ppvs) and negative predictive value (npvs) were calculated. The odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were also analyzed to test the association between pre-approval concerns and post-approval csar additions. Target ars with pre-approval concerns were added as csars in 88 of 406 ar-drug pairs (ppv: 21.7%). In contrast, target ars without pre-approval concerns were added as csars in 93 of 2304 drugs (npv: 96.0%).

The dates of pregnancy onset and delivery were identified using reported algorithms and the birth months of infants. The prevalence and timing of prescribed antihypertensives during pregnancy were descriptively evaluated. Time trends in prescriptions were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. We also evaluated the prevalence of antihypertensives prescribed within 180 days before pregnancy and 180 days after delivery among women who were covered by health insurers during the entire period. At least one antihypertensive agent was prescribed for 1144 (2.74%) of 41 693 pregnant women. The most frequently prescribed oral antihypertensive during pregnancy was nifedipine, followed by methyldopa, hydralazine, and furosemide. Drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system were prescribed for 21 pregnant women (0.05%), including angiotensin ii receptor blockers that were prescribed for 19 (0.05%) of them. Nicardipine was the most frequently prescribed injectable antihypertensive during pregnancy, followed by furosemide, hydralazine, and nitroglycerin. Annual prescription trends remained similar except for a significant decrease in those for oral and injectable furosemide and an annual increase in those for organic nitrate. Based on an evaluation of 33 941 pregnant women, the number of prescriptions for antihypertensives increased particularly during the third trimester, then decreased from 91 to 180 days after delivery.

This study was designed to evaluate the safety of this off-label use compared to the main approved drugs for aud (acamprosate, naltrexone, nalmefene). This cohort study from the french health insurance claims database included patients, aged 18 to 70 years, with no serious comorbidity (assessed by the charlson score) initiating baclofen or approved drugs for aud between 2009 and 2015. The risk of hospitalisation or death associated with baclofen, at variable doses over time (from low doses <30 mg/day to high doses ≥180 mg/day), compared to approved drugs, was evaluated by a cox model adjusted to sociodemographic and medical characteristics. The cohort included 165 334 patients, 47 614 of whom were exposed to baclofen. Patients exposed to baclofen differed from those treated with approved drugs in terms of sociodemographic and medical characteristics (more females, higher socioeconomic status, fewer hospitalisations for alcohol-related problems), but these differences tended to fade at higher doses of baclofen. Baclofen exposure was significantly associated with hospitalisation (hazard ratio [hr] = 1.13 [95%ci: 1.09-1.17]) and death (hr = 1.31 [95%ci: 1.08-1.60]). The risk increased with dose, reaching 1.46 [1.28-1.65] for hospitalisation and 2.27 [1.27-4.07] for death at high doses. Similar results were in patients with a history of hospitalisation for alcohol-related problems.

We examined and compared, over the same time frame, the outcomes of triptan exposure in pregnancy using (1) a retrospective claims database and (2) a previously completed pregnancy registry. Using the marketscan database, the risk of major birth defects was ascertained in live-born infants whose birth mothers were exposed to sumatriptan, naratriptan, or sumatriptan/naproxen during pregnancy. The frequencies of outcomes observed were compared with the findings of the 16-year sumatriptan, naratripan, and sumatriptan/naproxen prospective pregnancy registry. About 5120 pregnancies were identified in the retrospective claims cohort in contrast to 617 included in the prospective registry during the same time frame. The proportion of major birth defects among first-semester sumatriptan exposures was 4.0%, which is exactly the same as the proportion of major birth defects reported for first-semester sumatriptan exposures in the registry. There were very few non-livebirth outcomes in both the claims analyses and registry. These results confirm broad agreement between the database analysis and the registry regarding the safety of triptans during pregnancy. Of note, the number of triptan-exposed pregnancies identified in this large us database was about 7-fold that included in the prospective registry over the same time frame. The findings of this study support an approach of using existing health care database (s) in the post-approval assessment of medication exposure in pregnancy.",30240072

This study aimed to apply a biclustering algorithm in the spontaneous reporting system of china and to obtain the optimal parameters. The biclustering algorithm is expected to improve the efficiency of signal evaluation by identifying similar signal groups. Information component (ic) was the method used for disproportionality analysis. By using ic thresholds of various strengths (0.05-4.00), the original quantitative data matrix was transformed into 80 different binary data matrices, where each cell contained either a 1 or 0. The biclustering results were obtained using a total of 720 bimax algorithm parameters (minimal number of columns and rows was 3, 4, or 5). Next, the optimal parameters were determined through the comprehensive evaluation of the rank sum ration. Finally, we examined the biclustering results under the optimal parameters and evaluated the effect of biclustering analysis on adverse drug reaction (adr) data in china. The optimal strength of the ic threshold was 0.80, and the minimum number of rows and columns was 3. After taxonomic evaluation, we also found that 1836 biclusters (42.8%) contained similar drugs or similar adrs, which accounted for 72.3% of signals unevaluated.

Administration of second-generation antipsychotics has resulted in diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic coma leading to death. Therefore, pharmacists are required to collect information on clinical test values, determine the appropriate test timing, and coordinate with doctors for further clinical laboratory orders, all of which are labor-intensive and time-intensive tasks. In this study, we developed a side effect-monitoring tool and aimed to clarify the influence and efficiency of monitoring side effects by using the tool in patients taking atypical antipsychotics in whom it is necessary to check clinical test values such as blood sugar levels. We extracted clinical test values for patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics from electronic medical records. The test values are automatically displayed in the side effect grade classification specified by ctcae ver. 4.0. A database was constructed using scripts to provide alerts for the timing of clinical testing. The pharmacist used this tool to confirm clinical test values for patients taking medication and requested the physician to inspect orders based on the appropriate test timings. The management tool reduced the pharmacists' effort in collecting information on patients' prescription status and test values. It enabled patients to undergo tests at the appropriate time according to the progression of glucose metabolism and allowed for easy monitoring of side effects.

Data on psychiatric aes were extracted from clinical study reports (csrs) provided by the manufacturer of oseltamivir in 4 prophylaxis randomised trials in adults and adolescents. We analysed the incidence, recurrence, duration, and intensity of events, using logistic regression models where the outcome compared was proportion of days suffering from an event, and developed novel presentation techniques. Psychiatric aes were generally more frequent, longer, and more intense in the treatment than placebo arms.

A retrospective cohort study included 2361 pennsylvania medicaid enrollees aged 15 to 46 having buprenorphine therapy during pregnancy and a live birth between 2008 and 2015. We used group-based trajectory models to identify buprenorphine use patterns in the 40 weeks prior to delivery and 12 weeks postdelivery. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with specific trajectories. Six distinct trajectories were identified. Four groups initiated buprenorphine during the first trimester of the pregnancy (early initiators): 31.6% with persistently high adherence, 15.1% with moderate-to-high adherence, 10.5% with declining adherence, and 16.7% with early discontinuation. Two groups did not initiate buprenorphine until midsecond or third trimester (late initiators): 13.5% had moderate-to-high adherence and 12.6% had low-to-moderate adherence. Factors significantly associated with late initiation and discontinuation were younger age, non-white race, residents of rural counties, fewer outpatient visits, more frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and lower buprenorphine daily dose. Six buprenorphine treatment trajectories during pregnancy were identified in this population-based medicaid cohort, with 25% of women initiating buprenorphine late during pregnancy.

The aim of the study is to quantify the effect of hydrocodone's ""upscheduling"" on the use of opioid and nonopioid analgesics among chronic users. Using iqvia lrx lifelink anonymized pharmacy data 2013 to 2015, we performed interrupted time series analysis and group-based trajectory modeling to characterize the effect of rescheduling on 316 731 long-term hydrocodone users. Main measures were the number of prescriptions, patients, tablets, and morphine milligram equivalents of opioids and nonopioid analgesics pre and post the policy change. We used logistic regression to assess the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and these measures. The schedule change was associated with significant declines in opioid prescriptions (20.9%, from 421 798 to 333 627) and the number of patients using opioids (11.4%, from 307 974 to 272 804). Majority of hydrocodone users filled prescriptions for nonopioid analgesics with some declines in the number of users after the schedule change (5.2%, from 181 085 to 171 758). Based on group-based trajectory models, majority of patients continued to fill hcp prescriptions consistently after the policy change, while 15.4% showed large declines in hcp use, accounting for two-thirds of the decrease in opioid volume. There was no evidence that the policy change was associated with significant increases in the use of alternative analgesics. The upscheduling of hydrocodone led to reductions in opioid use, which were concentrated among a small subset of chronic hydrocodone users, without evidence of commensurate increases in the use of alternative pharmacologic pain treatments.",30187574

In daily practice, not all information is relevant or available, decreasing the applicability. We developed a new causality documentation tool (causdoc) where an algorithm is combined with expert judgement. The aim of this study is to test the validity and reliability of causdoc for adr reports on drugs and vaccines. Causdoc provides 9 structured relevant questions. If information is available, an answer will be chosen. If not, the question is excluded. Causality outcome is based on the sum score of all answers divided by the included questions: ≤30%: unlikely, 31% to 70%: possible, 71% to 90%: probable, and >90%: certain. Other relevant information is taken into account by expert judgement in the final step by adjusting the outcome to a limited extent. After testing face validity on 12 adr reports, sensitivity and specificity were tested on 40 adr reports, compared with the naranjo algorithm and who aefi criteria, using the expert panel's judgements as a standard. Inter-rater reliability was tested using weighted cohen kappa coefficient. Average sensitivity and specificity with causdoc were 47% and 83% for drugs (29% and 78% with naranjo) and 72% and 89% for vaccines (65% and 87% with who aefi criteria). Reliability between the 2 couples of assessors: κ 0.48 and 0.75. Causdoc shows a better performance and allows for a better documentation of adrs in clinical practice. This approach is useful in assessing the causality of adverse drug reactions.",30168222

Under the mini-sentinel pilot, several algorithms for identifying health outcomes of interest, including one for anaphylaxis, were developed and evaluated using data available from the sentinel common data model. To evaluate whether features extracted from unstructured narrative data using natural language processing (nlp) could be used to classify anaphylaxis cases. Using previously developed methods, we extracted features from unstructured narrative data using nlp and applied rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to identify anaphylaxis among 62 potential cases previously classified by human experts as anaphylaxis (n = 33), not anaphylaxis (n = 27), and unknown (n = 2). The rule-based and similarity-based approaches demonstrated almost equal performance (recall 100% vs 100%, precision 60.3% vs 57.4%, f-measure: 0.753 vs 0.729). Reasons for misclassification included the inability of the algorithms to make the same clinical judgments as human experts about the timing, severity, or presence of alternative explanations; and the identification of terms consistent with anaphylaxis but present in conditions other than anaphylaxis. Although precision needs to be improved before these algorithms could be used without human review, we demonstrated that applying rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to unstructured narrative information from clinical records can be used for classification of anaphylaxis in the sentinel system. Further development and assessment of these methods in the sentinel system are warranted.",30152575

Pharmacovigilance data have suggested an association between montelukast and depression, but the association has not been established in controlled study designs. We described the association between initiation of montelukast and depression, using prescriptions of antidepressants as a surrogate marker, and assessed whether the association was related to the underlying asthma disease. We performed a symmetry analysis, with a study period from january 1, 2000 to december 31, 2016, using 3 nationwide danish registers. We included all adults, who filled their first prescription of montelukast and antidepressants within an interval of 1 year. In the absence of an association between montelukast and antidepressant use, a symmetrical distribution of prescriptions is expected before and after montelukast initiation (ie, a sequence ratio [r  ] of 1.0). We subcategorized the subjects after the severity of underlying asthma disease. In total, 4450 subjects filled their first prescriptions of both montelukast and antidepressants within a 1-year interval: 2434 redeemed their first prescription of montelukast before antidepressants, and 2016 redeemed the medications in the opposite order (r  1.21 [95% ci 1.14-1.28]). We found r  above unity in groups with long-acting asthma treatment, but no increase in antidepressant prescription, when stratifying by the asthma severity. We found a weak association between the use of montelukast and the risk of being prescribed an antidepressant, unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Stratified analyses suggest that this association may relate to asthma, rather than to montelukast.",30136330

The objective of epiham was to identify the risks of hospital admission for acute liver injury (ali) associated with nsaids and nop. Case-population study in the 1/97 sample of the french population claims database. Acute liver injury was identified from hospital discharge summaries, from 2009 to 2013. Exposure for cases was dispensing of nsaid or nop resulting in exposure within 30 days before admission. Population exposure was the number of patients using the drugs over the study timeframe and total number of ddd dispensed. Of 63 cases of ali, 13 had been exposed to nsaids and 24 to nop. Events per million ddd (95% ci) ranged from 0.46 (0.09-1.34) (ketoprofen) to 1.43 (0.04-7.97) (diclofenac combinations), 0.43 (0.23-0.73) all nsaids combined, 0.58 (0.37-0.86) for nop. There was no association with average duration of treatment. Per patient risk ranged from 19.5 (5.31-49.9) (ibuprofen) per million users to 37.2 (19.8-63.6) all nsaids combined, 58.0 (37.2-86.3) for nop.

A retrospective, inception cohort design of patients who initiated treatment with modafinil between 2006 and 2008 was used in three us health care claims databases. Modafinil users were matched with nonusers. Patients were further divided into two cohorts of obstructive sleep apnea (osa) and non-osa (nosa) cohorts. Endpoints of interest, including myocardial infarction (mi), stroke, cv hospitalizations, and all-cause death, were assessed using incidence rates and cox proportional hazard ratios (hrs), adjusted for potential confounding factors. The cohorts included a total of 175 524 patients in marketscan cm; 77 266-in ims lifelink; and 8174-in marketscan medicaid. No increased risk for mi in the osa and nosa cohorts was observed across all three databases. The risks of cv hospitalization in the osa and nosa cohorts were not different between the modafinil users and nonusers, except for ims lifelink database where the hr was lower than one in the modafinil users compared with the nonusers (hr, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.54 to 0.87). For osa patients with prior stroke, an adjusted hr of 1.96 (95% ci, 1.02 to 3.76) was observed for stroke among modafinil users compared with nonusers.

We conducted a population-based cohort study with interrupted time series analysis using data from the clinical practice research datalink linked to hospital episode statistics. We identified women with live births from 2002 to 2015, excluding those with nonlactation indications for domperidone (n = 247 349). We evaluated trends in the prescription rate of domperidone in the 6 months postpartum and differences in this rate before and after the ema recommendation. Domperidone was prescribed among 1438 deliveries at a rate of 1.24 per 100 person-years. This rate increased from 0.56 to 2.1 per 100 person-years between 2002-2004 and 2011-2013 (rate ratio: 3.8; 95% confidence interval [ci], 3.2-4.6). Prescribing decreased in level by 0.35 (95% ci, -0.86 to 0.16) per 100 person-years immediately following the recommendation with little change in trend (0.003; 95% ci, -0.059 to 0.065 per 100 person-years). Following the recommendation, prescription of doses >30 mg and coprescription of drugs with a risk of torsade de pointes decreased. No arrhythmic events were observed among domperidone users. Although we observed an important increase in prescribing during the study period, domperidone remains infrequently prescribed postpartum in england.

Loop and thiazide diuretics promote urinary magnesium excretion. However, it is unknown if this links to hypomagnesaemia. We study if loop or thiazide diuretic use affects serum magnesium levels and if it associates with hypomagnesaemia. In addition, we study the effect of combining a potassium-sparing diuretic with a thiazide diuretic on the presence of hypomagnesaemia. The study performed a cross-sectional analysis within 9820 participants from the prospective rotterdam study. Hypomagnesaemia was defined as a serum magnesium level ≤0.72 mmol/l. Participants were categorized by defined daily dose (ddd), and all analyses were adjusted for age, sex, bmi, egfr, serum potassium levels, proton pump inhibitor use, and comorbidities. Loop diuretic use was associated with higher serum magnesium levels (<1 ddd: 0.004 mmol/l 95% ci: -0.008; 0.017; 1 ddd: 0.023 mmol/l 95% ci: 0.013; 0.032; >1 ddd: 0.043 mmol/l 95% ci: 0.028; 0.057).

These effects were predominantly seen in participants using diuretics for more than 390 days. Combining thiazide diuretics with a potassium-sparing agent was not associated with lower serum magnesium levels or hypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretic use is associated with lower serum magnesium levels and an increased risk of hypomagnesaemia.

New molecular entities and new therapeutic biologics approved in the united states between 1 january 2003 and 31 december 2013 were included in the analysis. Important drug-specific psras were defined as market withdrawal or the addition of new black box warnings or warnings due to adverse drug reactions. The relationship between baseline characteristics and the occurrence of important drug-specific psras was investigated using a multivariate logistic regression model. We also defined the event as the first important psra and estimated the time-to-event for each factor.

It has been hypothesized that products or events reported frequently may ""mask"" signals. We analyzed the masking effect of vaccines in pediatrics in the eudravigilance database by conducting disproportionality analysis in the full database (containing vaccine exposures) and in a restricted set (excluding vaccine exposures). We measured performance of the reporting odds ratio (ror) in both data sets using a pediatric-specific drug reference set and in the absence of a reference set. We assessed masking effects across age groups and conducted a classification tree (cart) analysis. Removal of vaccines decreased the ror values both in negative and positive controls. Exceptions were drug-event combinations including outcomes frequent in vaccine reports. When restricted to positive control associations, removal of vaccine-related events resulted in increased ror values for events commonly reported following vaccination. For events rarely associated with vaccination, ror values decreased for all age groups, especially infants. Analysis in the absence of a reference set showed decrease in ror following vaccine removal and cart revealed that change in ror with vaccine removal depended upon age and proportion of reports including a vaccine. Removal of vaccines for signal detection in a pediatric population has an impact on ror, dependent upon the reporting frequency of the event of interest in combination with vaccines. We recommend stratification by age and removal of vaccine exposures if the investigated adverse drug reactions include those typically reported in association with vaccines for the age strata.",30066460

A major drawback of this method is the inability to distinguish between new and non-new users of drugs, which for the study of hypersensitivity reactions is of utmost importance. We have explored an approach in which the exposure to the drugs of interest in the source population is inferred from a primary health care database (bifap), which helped us to identify drug initiators among all users and additionally adjust for potential confounders. A total of 44 sjs/ten cases from the registry and 44 000 controls randomly sampled from bifap and matched with cases for index date were included. We estimated the adjusted ors (aors) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) of sjs/ten associated with the new use of 13 drugs (for which we had at least two exposed cases) through a conditional logistic regression model.

Cases were also extracted from the hospital adr database. Medical records were reviewed to ensure consistent diagnosis and to extract clinical, documentation, and outcome data. Of 1110 patients coded as t88.6, 177 (15.9%) met the medication-related anaphylaxis definition. Eighty (40.8%) had anaphylaxis due to nonantimicrobial agents. Thirteen of these (16.3%) had a previous reaction to the same medication/group. In 51 (63.8%) patients, anaphylaxis occurred during inpatient stay, with 31 reactions occurring during surgery. Eighty-five medications were implicated, most commonly neuromuscular blocking agents (31, 36.5%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. No trends were noted over the 6-year period, and there was no anaphylaxis-related mortality. Fifty-three (66.3%) patients were assessed in allergy clinics. One in 10 cases did not have the reaction documented in the discharge summary. Adverse drug reaction reports were received for 38 patients (47.5%). Although acute patient outcomes were excellent, gaps in practice were noted regarding adr coding accuracy and reporting rates.

Among new users of cilostazol, we compared the prevalence of conditions targeted by the risk minimization measures in the periods before (2002-2012) and after (2014) implementation. Conditions evaluated were prevalence of smoking, cardiovascular conditions, concurrent use of ≥2 antiplatelet agents, concurrent use of potent cyp3a4/cyp2c19 inhibitors and high-dose cilostazol, early monitoring of all users, and continuous monitoring of users at high cardiovascular risk. We included 22 593 and 1821 new users of cilostazol before and after implementation of risk minimization measures, respectively. After implementation, the frequency of several conditions related to the labeling changes improved in all the study populations: prevalence of use decreased between 13% (epichron) and 57% (sidiap), frequency of cardiovascular contraindications decreased between 8% (gepard) and 84% (epichron), and concurrent use of high-dose cilostazol and potent cyp3a4/cyp2c19 inhibitors decreased between 6% (sweden) and 100% (epichron). The frequency of other conditions improved in most study populations, except smoking, which decreased only in epichron (48% reduction).

We conducted a simulation study to examine how avoiding sharing individual-level data in a distributed data network can affect analytic results. The base scenario had four sites of varying sizes with 5% outcome incidence, 50% treatment prevalence, and seven confounders. We varied treatment prevalence, outcome incidence, treatment effect, site size, number of sites, and covariate distribution. Confounding adjustment was conducted using propensity score or disease risk score. We compared analyses of three types of aggregate-level data requested from sites: risk-set, summary-table, or effect-estimate data (meta-analysis) with benchmark results of analysis of pooled individual-level data. We assessed bias and precision of hazard ratio estimates as well as the accuracy of standard error estimates. All the aggregate-level data-sharing approaches, regardless of confounding adjustment methods, successfully approximated pooled individual-level data analysis in most simulation scenarios. Meta-analysis showed minor bias when using inverse probability of treatment weights (iptw) in infrequent exposure (5%), rare outcome (0.01%), and small site (5,000 patients) settings. Se estimates became less accurate for iptw risk-set approach with less frequent exposure and for propensity score-matching meta-analysis approach with rare outcomes. Overall, we found that we can avoid sharing individual-level data and obtain valid results in many settings, although care must be taken with meta-analysis approach in infrequent exposure and rare outcome scenarios, particularly when confounding adjustment is performed with iptw.",30022561

We reconsidered all codes used by the original algorithm and applied it to data of gepard from 2006 to 2014. Longitudinal records of pregnancies were used to identify targets for enhancing the algorithm's specificity. We checked the plausibility of the results, eg, regarding the age distribution of persons with pregnancy outcomes. Based on 20 longitudinal records of pregnancies, we compared the outcome classification by clinical experts with the results of the modified algorithm. Our algorithm identified 1 235 261 pregnancy outcomes in the database, with the majority (94%) being live births, classified as preterm (10%), term (78%), and (12%) births after the expected delivery date. The median age of pregnant women was 32 years (q1 28; q3 35). Implausible sequence of outcomes (for example, an induced abortion within a pregnancy categorized as ending in a live birth) were rare (0.03%).

De-identified electronic health record (ehr) and claims data were obtained from the optum integrated claims-clinical database for cross-sections of commercial and medicare advantage health plan members age ≥ 20 years in 2013, 2014, and 2016. In each calendar year, health plan members' bmi as coded in the insurance claims data (error-prone measure) was compared with their bmi as recorded in the ehr (gold standard) to estimate the sensitivity and ppv of bmi-related icd-9-cm and icd-10-cm diagnosis codes. The unit of analysis was the person-year. The study sample included 746 763 distinct health plan members who contributed 1 116 283 eligible person-years (median age 56 years; 57% female; 65% commercially insured and 35% with medicare advantage). Bmi-related diagnoses were coded for 14.6%. The sensitivity of bmi-related diagnoses codes for the detection of underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity was 10.1%, 3.7%, 6.0%, and 25.2%, and the ppv was 49.0% for underweight, 89.6% for normal weight, 73.4% for overweight, and 92.4% for obesity, respectively. The sensitivity of bmi-related diagnosis codes was higher in the icd-10-cm era relative to the icd-9-cm era. The ppv of bmi-related diagnosis codes for normal weight, overweight, and obesity was high (>70%) but the sensitivity was low (<30%).

Recent data suggest that transdermal fentanyl and oxycodone cr may have greater toxicity than morphine sr in patients with non-cancer pain. Thus, we compared the risk of out-of-hospital deaths in patients with non-cancer pain filling prescriptions for transdermal fentanyl or oxycodone cr with that for morphine sr. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 50 658 patients enrolled in tennessee medicaid who filled prescriptions for transdermal fentanyl (n = 8717), oxycodone cr (n = 14 118), or morphine sr (n = 27 823) between 1999 and 2011. We excluded individuals with cancer or other life-threatening diagnoses and used propensity scores to adjust for multiple potential confounders. The primary outcome was out-of-hospital mortality. During 44 385 person-years of follow-up, 689 patients died. The out-of-hospital mortality rate among all study subjects was 155/10 000 patient-years. Contrary to earlier data suggesting greater risk, mortality was not significantly different in patients filling prescriptions for transdermal fentanyl compared with morphine sr (adjusted hr = 0.96, 95% c.i.: 0.77-1.21); moreover, patients filling prescriptions for oxycodone cr had lower mortality risk compared with those filling prescriptions for morphine sr (adjusted hr = 0.79, 95% c.i. 0.66-0.95). In the study population, long-acting opioids for non-cancer pain were associated with high out-of-hospital mortality rates. We found comparable out-of-hospital mortality risks associated with transdermal fentanyl and morphine sr. The risk of out-of-hospital death for oxycodone cr was lower than that for morphine sr.",30003613

The us food and drug administration (fda) has the authority to require marketing authorization holders of medicinal products to implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (rems) to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. Aside from medication guides, no research has been conducted to assess the quality of patient-targeted rems materials, including whether, and to what extent, patients find these materials understandable and actionable. To describe the readability, understandability, and actionability of patient educational materials in currently approved rems programs, and to highlight opportunities for improving both the quality and effectiveness of these important drug safety tools. Seventy-seven rems programs were identified from the fda rems database. We excluded medication guides (mgs) from our analysis because of the fact that there is a mandatory mg template. Based on this, we identified a total of 27 (non-mg) rems patient materials on the fda rems website for analysis purposes. The materials were tested for readability using the lexile measure, the gunning fog index, and flesch kincaid and then assessed using the patient education materials assessment tool for printable materials, for understandability and actionability. Twenty-three of 77 (30%) rems programs used educational materials to communicate serious risks to patients, yielding a total of 27 rems patient materials for analysis. The median readability score for these materials was at a ninth-grade reading level or higher. While most (89%) of these patient education materials met established criteria for being understandable, less than half (49%) were deemed actionable. Currently approved rems patient materials fell short in terms of recommended reading level, and over half did not meet recommended standards for actionability. Developers of these materials should apply plain language principles when design these materials to improve their readability and to assess both understandability and actionability in order to increase the effectiveness when distributed to patients.",30003610

Our objective was to determine the impact of regulatory actions on trimetazidine utilization in portugal. Retrospective interrupted time-series analysis of monthly ambulatory pharmacy reimbursement records for the portuguese national health service between january 2006 and december 2015. Regulatory actions were identified by searching the ema, portuguese medicines authority, and european commission's websites. Concurrent factors in the same period were also identified. The main outcome was the dispensing of trimetazidine-containing products per month in portugal. Two interruption periods were defined in the series: may 2011, when ema announced it would review trimetazidine safety, and june 2012 to january 2013, when ema announced it had reached a final opinion recommending restrictions; the european commission approved ema's recommendation; the portuguese medicines authority issued safety alerts, changed the summary of product characteristics, and approved a direct health-care professional letter; and a regional bulletin was issued. Interruption 1 had no effect on trimetazidine use, but interruption 2 resulted in decreases in level and trend-from 8.3 million defined daily doses in 2010 to 2.8 million in 2015. After interruption 2, trimetazidine use tended towards a lower steady state. There was a significant decrease in trimetazidine use in portugal following a complex intervention that included safety alerts, changes to the summary of product characteristics, a direct health-care professional letter, and a regional drug bulletin.

To optimize signal detection investigating the interest of time-series analysis in pharmacovigilance and the benefits of combining cpa with the proportional reporting ratio (prr). We investigated the couple benfluorex and aortic valve incompetence (avi) using the french national pharmacovigilance and eudravigilance databases: cpa was applied on monthly counts of reports and the lower bound of monthly computed prr (prr-). We stated a cpa hypothesis that the substance-event combination is more likely to be a signal when the 2 following criteria are fulfilled: prr- is greater than 1 with at least 5 cases, and cpa method detects at least 2 successive change points of prr- which made consecutively increasing segments. We tested this hypothesis by 95 test cases identified from a drug safety reference set and 2 validated signals from eudravigilance database: cpa was applied on prr-. For benfluorex and avi, change points detected by cpa on prr- were more meaningful compared with monthly counts of reports: more change points detected and detected earlier. In the reference set, 14 positive controls satisfied cpa hypothesis, 6 positive controls only met first requirements, 3 negative controls only met first requirement, and 2 validated signals satisfied cpa hypothesis. The combination of cpa and prr represents a significant advantage in detecting earlier signals and reducing false-positive signals. This approach should be confirmed in further studies.",29992679

An american heart association review recently identified a variety of medicines that may cause or exacerbate heart failure (hf), many with evidence from limited evaluation of population data. We assessed the risk of first-time hf associated with the use of 50 of these medicines by new zealand's primary care population. Case-control study utilising national pharmaceutical use and hospital admissions data 2007-2015; 22,989 patients with first-time hf 2008-2015 were matched with 114 498 control patients. The primary outcome was first-time hf and its association with medicine exposure in the prior 90 days, estimated using conditional logistic regression. We also assessed the risk associated with new use of medicines in the prior month, concurrent use, and in patients with existing comorbidity. Eleven medicines were significantly associated with hf with several other infrequently used medicines providing signals of increased risk. A high risk was associated with the use of salbutamol (adjusted odds ratio 2.63; 95% ci, 2.48-2.78), clozapine (2.70; 2.46-4.98), diltiazem (1.52; 1.44-1.60), indomethacin (2.51; 1.54-4.10), pioglitazone (1.50; 1.16-1.95), and antifungal medicines. New use of medicines and use of medicine combinations increased this risk in many cases.

This study aimed to validate 2 different types of approaches for estimating prescription durations, using the oral anticoagulant warfarin as a case. The approaches undergoing empirical validation covered assumptions of a fixed daily intake of either 0.5 or 1.0 defined daily dose (ddd), as well as estimates based on the reverse parametric waiting time distribution (rwtd), with different sets of covariates. We converted estimates of prescription duration to daily dose and compared them to prescribed daily dose as recorded in a clinical registry (using bland-altman plots). Methods were compared based on their average prediction error (logarithmic scale) and their limit of agreement ratio (ratio of mean error ± 1.96 sd after transformation to original scale). Estimates of daily doses were underestimated by 19% or overestimated by 62% when assumptions of 0.5 or 1.0 ddd were applied. The limit of agreement ratio was 6.721 for both assumptions. The rwtd-based approaches performed better when using the estimated mean value of the inter-arrival density, yielding on average negligible bias (relative difference of 0 to 2%) and with limit of agreement ratios decreasing upon additional covariate adjustment (from 6.857 with no adjustment to 4.036 with the fully adjusted model). Comparing the different methods, the rwtd algorithm performed best and led to unbiased estimates of prescribed doses and thus prescription durations and reduced misclassification on the individual level upon inclusion of covariates.",29952049

This method only allows patients to be studied until their first treatment break. The ""proportion of patients covered"" (ppc) method is another approach to study treatment persistence. It measures the proportion of live patients currently covered by treatment. We aimed to describe the ppc method, show how the km survival analysis and the ppc method can describe treatment persistence, and discuss the interpretation/application of the methods. We identified new users of statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, hormone replacement therapy, and ibuprofen. We used km estimates and the ppc to describe persistence in the 3 years post treatment initiation, using a grace period of 90 days to define a treatment break. Three years after statin initiation, approximately 40% of patients were still in continuous treatment (km survival) and 60% of patients still alive were in current treatment (ppc). Corresponding numbers were 12% and 25% for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 9% and 29% for hormone replacement therapy. At 1 year, numbers were 5% and 10% for ibuprofen. The ppc showed markedly less variability than the km survival analysis with different choices of grace periods. The km survival analysis and the ppc method can be used to study different aspects of treatment persistence. Together, they provide a more complete picture of treatment persistence and drug use patterns.",29952045

Patients aged 2 to 89 years with a first prescription for an anticoagulant (rivaroxaban or warfarin) between 2012 and 2015 were identified in thin. Major bleeding events, defined as bleeding events necessitating hospitalization or referral to accident and emergency services or a specialist clinic, were identified using a 2-step ascertainment process based on read codes only, and then validated using a 2-step process requiring manual review of patients' records. The positive predictive value for the ascertainment of major intracranial (ic) bleeds using only read codes was 96.9%, compared with 70.4% for gastrointestinal (gi) bleeds and 64.1% for urogenital (ug) bleeds. The incidence rate of major ic bleeding events was therefore similar when it was calculated before and after validation (0.32 per 100 person-years and 0.31 per 100 person-years, respectively). The incidence rate of major gi bleeds identified using read codes alone was reduced following validation from 2.05 to 0.94 per 100 person-years, and that of major ug bleeds decreased from 2.45 to 1.11 per 100 person-years. Major gi and ug bleeding events ascertained from thin using read codes require validation using additional information to prevent outcome misclassification. The absence of validation may lead to overestimated incidence rates of major bleeding for gi and ug bleeds.",29947124

We identified dpp-4i or tzd initiators after a 6-month washout using medicare claims 2006-2013. The iv was defined as a binary variable comparing initiators during october 2010 to december 2013 (postperiod) versus january 2008 to may 2010 (preperiod). We examined iv strength and estimated risk differences (rds) for hf using kaplan-meier curves, which were compared with propensity score (ps)-weighted rd for dpp-4i versus tzd. The iv compared 22 696 initiators (78% dpp-4i) in the postperiod versus 20 283 initiators (38% dpp-4i) in the preperiod, resulting in 40% compliance. The active-comparator (ps-weighted) approach compared 26 198 dpp-4i and 18 842 tzd initiators. Covariate balance across iv levels was slightly better than across treatments (standardized difference, 3% vs 4.5%). The 1- and 2-year local average treatment effects of rd of hf per 100 patients in the ""compliers"" (95% confidence intervals) were -0.62 (-0.99 to -0.25) and -0.88 (-1.46 to -0.25). Corresponding ps-weighted results were -0.20 (-0.33 to -0.05) and -0.18 (-0.30 to 0.03). Both approaches indicated lesser risk of hf hospitalizations among dpp-4i vs tzd initiators.

Fifteen prisons (out of 26 of the total eligible population) agreed to take part, and data from medical records of 190 older and 190 younger male prisoners were analysed. Descriptive statistics on pain medication prescriptions (excluding drugs used in opioid dependence) were carried out and differences between the 2 age groups tested for statistical significance. More than half of younger and older prisoners were prescribed pain medication during the past 180 days, while 10% of younger and 15% of older prisoners were prescribed pain medication on a daily basis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ""other analgesics and antipyretics"" were most frequently prescribed. Significantly (p < .05), more younger than older prisoners were prescribed nsaids and drugs to treat muscle skeletal pain. Tramadol was the opioid most often prescribed. This is the first empirical study investigating prescriptions of pain medication in swiss prisoners on a national level. It shows that nonopioid pain medication is an important part of health care provision inside prison, while there are only few prescriptions of strong opioids.

Conditional logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for pancreatic cancer associated with ppi use, adjusting for potential confounders. Secondary analyses examined dose-response patterns and associations with individual ppis as well as with histamine-2-receptor antagonists. Ever use of ppis occurred among 27.8% of 6921 pancreatic cancer cases and 25.4% of 34 695 matched controls, yielding a neutral adjusted or of 1.04 (95% ci 0.97-1.11).

Data on births from the medical birth registry of norway were linked to the norwegian prescription database, identifying women's use of medications around pregnancy. All women giving birth in norway during 2005 to 2015 (638 532 singleton births to 414 567 women) were included. Proportions of pregnant women using different medications in association with pregnancy, and annual relative change in medication use during 2005 to 2015, were calculated. In norway, 60% of pregnant women used prescription medications during pregnancy (2005-15), increasing from 57% in 2005 to 62% in 2015. The annual relative increase was 0.9% (95% ci: 0.8-1.0). In the first trimester, approximately 17% of the women used medications regarded as potentially teratogenic during 2005 to 2015, increasing from 15% to 19%. Overall, this proportion was higher in the first than in the second (8.9%) and third (8.0%) trimesters, and higher than in the 3 months after pregnancy (14%). The annual relative increase of medications regarded as potentially teratogenic in the first trimester was 2.5% (95% ci: 2.3-2.7). The proportion of women using potentially teratogenic medications in the first trimester of pregnancy have increased during the last decade. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of pregnancy when prescribing potentially teratogenic medication to women of fertile age and focus this in the consultations. The increasing trends call for the need of routine surveillance of adverse birth outcomes linked to medication use in pregnancy.",29920833

The objective of this study was to evaluate as medication use and its association with vod within the german primary care setting. Cases with vod from the content (continuous morbidity registration epidemiologic network) database were 1:1 matched to controls on age, sex, and comorbidities by propensity score matching. As medication was defined using the fourth level of anatomical therapeutic chemical classification (atc) codes. A prescription of as medication any time within the study period formed the primary exposure. Multivariable conditional logistic regression examined the association between as use and vod. Of a total of n = 151 446 patients, 6971 (4.6%) cases and 6971 corresponding controls were analyzed (mean age (sd): 59.9 years (20.9), 64.2% female). Dizziness and giddiness (icd-10 code r42) were diagnosed most prominently (87.2%). As medication was prescribed on 1072 of 10 552 (10.2%) consultation days with vod diagnoses. After adjusting for covariates, as use was significantly and independently associated with vod, adjusted odds ratio (1.37; 95% ci: 1.18-1.58), compared with no as use. Primary care practitioners should consider as medication as a risk factor for vod and avoid prescribing as medications after a vod diagnosis. Caution should also be taken when prescribing as medications to older adults (≥65 years). Systematical calculations of as medication burden for patients could help acknowledge this issue and raise awareness for prescription habits in primary care.",29896933

We conducted repeated sample size estimates to calculate the medical device utilization needed, systematically varying device-specific safety event rate ratios and significance levels while maintaining 80% power, testing 3 average adverse event rates (3.9, 6.1, and 12.6 events per 100 person-years) estimated from the american college of cardiology's 2006 to 2010 national cardiovascular data registry of icds. We then compared with actual medical device utilization. At significance level 0.05 and 80% power, 34% or fewer icd models accrued sufficient utilization in practice to detect safety differences for rate ratios <1.15 and an average event rate of 12.6 events per 100 person-years. For average event rates of 3.9 and 12.6 events per 100 person-years, 30% and 50% of icd models, respectively, accrued sufficient utilization for a rate ratio of 1.25, whereas 52% and 67% for a rate ratio of 1.50. Because actual icd utilization was not uniformly distributed across icd models, the proportion of individuals receiving any icd that accrued sufficient utilization in practice was 0% to 21%, 32% to 70%, and 67% to 84% for rate ratios of 1.05, 1.15, and 1.25, respectively, for the range of 3 average adverse event rates.

Study objectives were to characterize dispensation patterns, to measure gaps between expected and observed refill dates for warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (doacs). Retrospective cohort study using administrative health care databases of the régie de l'assurance-maladie du québec. We identified every dispensation of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for patients with af initiating oral anticoagulants between 2010 and 2015. For each dispensation, we extracted date and duration. Refill gaps were calculated as difference between expected and observed dates of successive dispensation. Refill gaps were summarized using descriptive statistics. To account for repeated observations nested within patients and to assess the components of variance of refill gaps, we used unconditional multilevel linear models. We identified 61 516 new users. Majority were prescribed warfarin (60.3%), followed by rivaroxaban (16.4%), dabigatran (14.5%), apixaban (8.8%). Most frequent recorded duration of dispensation was 7 days, suggesting use of pharmacist-prepared weekly pillboxes. The average refill gap from multilevel model was higher for warfarin (9.28 days, 95%ci:8.97-9.59) compared with doacs (apixaban 3.08 days, 95%ci: 2.96-3.20, dabigatran 3.70, 95%ci: 3.56-3.84, rivaroxaban 3.15, 95%ci: 3.03-3.27). The variance of refill gaps was greater among warfarin users than among doac users. Greater refill gaps for warfarin may reflect inadequate capture of the period covered by the number of dispensed pills recorded in administrative data. A time-dependent definition of exposure using dispensation data would lead to greater misclassification of warfarin than doacs use.",29869382

The epidemic began with an escalation of prescription opioid deaths and has now evolved to include secondary waves of illicit heroin and fentanyl deaths, while the deaths due to prescription opioid overdoses are still increasing. In response, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) moved to limit opioid prescribing with the release of opioid prescribing guidelines for chronic noncancer pain in march 2016. The guidelines represent a logical and timely federal response to this growing crisis. However, cdc acknowledged that the evidence base linking opioid prescribing to opioid use disorders and overdose was grades 3 and 4. Motivated by the need to strengthen the evidence base, this review details limitations of the opioid safety studies cited in the cdc guidelines with a focus on methodological limitations related to internal and external validity. Internal validity concerns were related to poor confounding control, variable misclassification, selection bias, competing risks, and potential competing interventions. External validity concerns arose from the use of limited source populations, historical data (in a fast-changing epidemic), and issues with handling of cancer and acute pain patients' data. We provide a nonexhaustive list of 7 recommendations to address these limitations in future opioid safety studies. Strengthening the opioid safety evidence base will aid any future revisions of the cdc guidelines and enhance their prevention impact.",29862602

We developed an algorithm to identify pregnancy episodes in the french health care databases and applied it to study antiepileptic drug (aed) use during pregnancy between 2007 and 2014. The algorithm searched the french health care databases for discharge diagnoses and medical procedures indicative of completion of a pregnancy. To differentiate claims associated with separate pregnancies, an interval of at least 28 weeks was required between 2 consecutive pregnancies resulting in a birth and 6 weeks for terminations of pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes were categorized into live births, stillbirths, elective abortions, therapeutic abortions, spontaneous abortions, and ectopic pregnancies. Outcome dates and gestational ages were used to calculate pregnancy start dates. According to our algorithm, live birth was the most common pregnancy outcome (73.9%), followed by elective abortion (17.2%), spontaneous abortion (4.2%), ectopic pregnancy (1.1%), therapeutic abortion (1.0%), and stillbirth (0.4%). These results were globally consistent with french official data. Among 7 559 701 pregnancies starting between 2007 and 2014, corresponding to 4 900 139 women, 6.7 per 1000 pregnancies were exposed to an aed. The number of pregnancies exposed to older aeds, comprising the most teratogenic aeds, decreased throughout the study period (-69.4%), while the use of newer aeds increased (+73.4%). We have developed an algorithm that allows identification of a large number of pregnancies and all types of pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy outcome and start dates were accurately identified, and maternal data could be linked to neonatal data.",29763992

Anrs co22 hepather is a french multicentre prospective observational cohort started in 2012. The cohort includes patients with chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection with reports of all adverse events (aes) occurring in patients exposed to hcv drugs. We applied a disproportionality method, which calculated a measure of association, the bayesian information component (ic), for each drug-ae pair. Information components were continuously updated and a positive drug-ae association was detected when the lower limit of an ic 95% credible interval (95% ci) exceeded 0. We illustrate how the method could result in timely detection of photosensitivity reaction with simeprevir use. By august 28, 2016, 6600 patients with hcv infection had been treated or were undergoing current hcv treatment, and 3464 experienced at least one ae for a total of 12 720 reported aes. We detected 52 positive drug-ae associations, including 44 that were known adrs based on the summary of product characteristics. The association between simeprevir and photosensitivity reaction was detected on june 4, 2014. At this date, 68 patients had received simeprevir and 6 photosensitivity reaction (4 during simeprevir treatment) had been reported for an estimated ic of 1.90, 95% ci, 0.20-3.61. The disproportionality method can help with early detection of potential adrs in patient cohorts. Detected associations need to be confirmed by a review of clinical data.",29749668

All women who were hospitalized in the maternity ward and had at least one pregnancy that ended with a delivery during the period of january 2014 and december 2015 were included in this study. The true delivery date was obtained from the electronic medical records and was used as a gold standard. The onset of pregnancy was calculated by subtracting the gestational age at birth from the delivery date based on the electronic medical records and was also used as a gold standard. The administrative data-based algorithms to identify (1) the onset of pregnancy estimated from the gestational age recorded as part of a diagnosis during a specific visit and (2) the delivery date estimated using the delivery-related diagnosis, procedure, or prescription were compared with the gold-standard data. Of the 1705 women included in this study, the onset of pregnancy was determined in 1704 subjects with 1582 (92.8%) within ± 7 days from the gold-standard date of pregnancy onset. The delivery date was determined in 1654 subjects, and 1594 (96.4%) were within ± 7 days before the true delivery date using the algorithm of ""selected"" diagnosis and a surgical procedure followed by some other delivery-related data.

We used electronic medical records from the health improvement network database between january 1995 and june 2012 to identify the first pregnancy in women 15 to 45 years of age with pregestational diabetes type 1 or type 2. Information on lifestyle factors, demographic characteristics, prescription of specific antidiabetic medications, and glycemic control measures (hba1c) was obtained from primary care provider records. We evaluated treatment patterns and hba1c levels within 90 days before the last menstrual period (prepregnancy period) and within each trimester of pregnancy. In a cohort of 1511 pregnant women with pregestational diabetes, 60% had type 1 and 40% type 2 diabetes. Among women with type 1 diabetes, 90% received antidiabetic medication (primarily insulin) prepregnancy and 92% during the first trimester. Among women with type 2 diabetes, 54% received antidiabetic medication (primarily metformin) during the prepregnancy period and 60% during the first trimester. Among women with nontreated diabetes type 2 before pregnancy, 22% initiated treatment by the first trimester (primarily insulin); those on noninsulin antidiabetic medications often switched to insulin. The proportion of women with at least 1 hba1c value recorded within the prepregnancy period was 33% for type 1 (n = 299) and 31% for type 2 diabetes (n = 189); the corresponding proportions within the first trimester were 48% and 40%, respectively. Among women with recorded hba1c, the prevalence of hba1c > 7% prepregnancy was 70% for type 1 and 52% for type 2 diabetes; the proportions within the first trimester were 73% and 46%, respectively. Management of pregnant women with diabetes seems to follow recommendations for pharmacological treatment. However, there is substantial room for improvement in hba1c control, that is, in the planning of pregnancy in women with diabetes, in the initiation of antidiabetic medication among women with diabetes type 2 who may need it, and likely in the compliance with treatments in women with type 2 and type 1 diabetes.",29740916

A retrospective analysis of non-health care facility unintentional therapeutic errors associated with antidepressant and antipsychotic medications was conducted using data from the national poison data system. From 2000 to 2012, poison control centers received 207 670 calls reporting unintentional therapeutic errors associated with antidepressant or antipsychotic medications that occurred outside of a health care facility, averaging 15 975 errors annually. The rate of antidepressant-related errors increased by 50.6% from 2000 to 2004, decreased by 6.5% from 2004 to 2006, and then increased 13.0% from 2006 to 2012. The rate of errors related to antipsychotic medications increased by 99.7% from 2000 to 2004 and then increased by 8.8% from 2004 to 2012. Overall, 70.1% of reported errors occurred among adults, and 59.3% were among females. The medications most frequently associated with errors were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (30.3%), atypical antipsychotics (24.1%), and other types of antidepressants (21.5%). Most medication errors took place when an individual inadvertently took or was given a medication twice (41.0%), inadvertently took someone else's medication (15.6%), or took the wrong medication (15.6%). This study provides a comprehensive overview of non-health care facility unintentional therapeutic errors associated with antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. The frequency and rate of these errors increased significantly from 2000 to 2012. Given that use of these medications is increasing in the us, this study provides important information about the epidemiology of the associated medication errors.",29740912

Because individual bzds have different clinical profiles, we assessed the nationwide trends of long-term bzd use at active substance level during years 2006 to 2014. This study covered all reimbursed bzd purchases (n = 408 572-521 823 annually) for adults recorded in the finnish prescription register. We assessed long-term use (annual cumulative purchase of ≥180 defined daily doses) in general, and at active substance level with the most commonly used bzd anxiolytics (oxazepam, diazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam for nonepilepsy indications) and hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem, and temazepam) included. The persistence rates for each substance were assessed separately. The prevalence of long-term bzd use among finnish adults declined significantly from 5.3% to 3.6%, during years 2006 to 2014. Despite this decline, there was a significant increase in the long-term use of clonazepam for nonepilepsy indications and zolpidem (28.0% and 17.5%, respectively). Long-term use was common in the aged population, as well as among the users of hypnotics or clonazepam. Persistent use of 9 consecutive calendar years varied between 7.5% for incident alprazolam users and 21.0% for incident clonazepam users. We found a declining trend in long-term bzd use, but the decline was not uniform between the substances-the long-term use of clonazepam and zolpidem even increased. Follow-up research is needed to assess whether the decline in bzd use is accompanied by an increased use of other types of anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs or other forms of treatment.",29726630

Medicaid claims were linked to prescription drug monitoring program records for a cohort of beneficiaries enrolled in the north carolina medicaid lip (n = 2701). Using latent class growth analyses, we estimated trajectories of average daily mmes of opioids dispensed to beneficiaries across specific time periods of interest. Five trajectory patterns appeared to sufficiently describe underlying heterogeneity. Starting values and slopes varied across the 5 trajectory groups, which followed these overall patterns: (1) start at a high level of mmes, end at a high level of mmes (13.1% of cohort); (2) start medium, end medium (13.2%); (3) start medium, end low (21.5%); (4) start low, end medium (22.6%); and (5) start low, end low (29.6%). We observed strong associations between patterns and beneficiaries' demographics, substance use-related characteristics, comorbid conditions, and healthcare utilization. In its current form, the medicaid lip appeared to have limited impact on beneficiaries' opioid trajectories. However, strong associations between trajectory patterns and beneficiary characteristics provide insight into potential lip design modifications that might improve program impact (eg, lip integration of substance use disorder assessment and referral to treatment, assessment and support for alternate pain therapies).",29700904

Children aged 0 to 17 years (5-17 years for asthma) registered in the integrated primary care information database between 2002 and 2014 were studied. We tested the impact of the following: maximum duration of disease episode (0, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days) on recurrent diseases (acute otitis media [common] and acute pyelonephritis [rare]); and database run-in period on chronic diseases-asthma (common) and type 1 diabetes (dm) (rare). We calculated incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals and stratified using 1-year age categories. Altogether, 503 495 children were registered. The incidence of acute otitis media was highest in <2-year-old children; using 30 days disease duration as reference, the rate increased with 8% if the duration was 14 days and decreased with 8% when extended to 60 days. Disease duration did not impact acute pyelonephritis (rare). No run-in (to exclude prevalent cases) versus 24-month run-in period overestimated the incidence rate for asthma and dm by a factor of 2.

Patients were followed 1 year, and aberrant opioid behavior was defined according to each algorithm, using cohen's kappa to assess agreement. Risk differences were calculated comparing risk of opioid-related adverse events for identified aberrant and nonaberrant users.

Patient prescribed antidepressants were linked to physician claims and hospitalization data to obtain all diagnoses recorded in the past year. Diagnostic codes had poor sensitivity for all treatment indications, ranging from a high of only 31.2% (95% ci, 26.8%-35.9%) for anxiety/stress disorders to as low as 1.3% (95% ci, 0.0%-5.2%) for sexual dysfunction. Sensitivity was notably worse among older patients and patients with more chronic comorbidities.

Data preparation steps are rarely reported adequately and are likely to vary between research groups. Variation in methodology could potentially affect study outcomes. This study aimed to develop a framework to define and document drug data preparation and to examine the impact of different assumptions on results. An algorithm for processing prescription data was developed and tested using data from the clinical practice research datalink (cprd). The impact of varying assumptions was examined by estimating the association between 2 exemplar medications (oral hypoglycaemic drugs and glucocorticoids) and cardiovascular events after preparing multiple datasets derived from the same source prescription data. Each dataset was analysed using cox proportional hazards modelling. The algorithm included 10 decision nodes and 54 possible unique assumptions. Over 11 000 possible pathways through the algorithm were identified. In both exemplar studies, similar hazard ratios and standard errors were found for the majority of pathways; however, certain assumptions had a greater influence on results. For example, in the hypoglycaemic analysis, choosing a different variable to define prescription end date altered the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) from 1.77 (1.56-2.00) to 2.83 (1.59-5.04). The framework offers a transparent and efficient way to perform and report drug data preparation steps. Assumptions made during data preparation can impact the results of analyses.

Of all 101 530 people identified with an incident suicide attempt/self-harm contact at danish hospitals between 1995 and 2012 using the dk-algorithm, we selected a random sample of 475 people. We validated the dk-algorithm against medical records applying the definitions and terminology of the columbia classification algorithm of suicide assessment of suicidal events, nonsuicidal events, and indeterminate or potentially suicidal events. We calculated positive predictive values (ppvs) of the dk-algorithm to identify suicidal events overall, by gender, age groups, and calendar time. We retrieved medical records for 357 (75%) people. The ppv of the dk-algorithm to identify suicidal events was 51.5% (95% ci: 46.4-56.7) overall, 42.7% (95% ci: 35.2-50.5) in males, and 58.5% (95% ci: 51.6-65.1) in females. The ppv varied further across age groups and calendar time. After excluding cases identified via the dk-algorithm by unspecific codes of intoxications and injury, the ppv improved slightly (56.8% [95% ci: 50.0-63.4]). The dk-algorithm can reliably identify self-harm with suicidal intention in 52% of the identified cases of suicide attempts/self-harm. The ppvs could be used for quantitative bias analysis and implemented as weights in future studies to estimate the proportion of suicidal events among cases identified via the dk-algorithm.",29664233

In many countries, nsaids have been widely used among patients with ari or common cold for pain and fever relief. However, studies evaluating whether nsaids use during ari episodes may further increase the risk of stroke were very limited. During 2007 to 2011, 29 518 patients with an incident hospitalization of stroke were identified. The date of admission was defined as the index date. Using case-crossover design, we compared the following exposure status between the case period (1- to 7-d period before the index date) and matched control period (366- to 372-d period before the index date): nsaids use during ari episodes, ari episodes without nsaids use, nsaids use only, or no exposure. Multivariable conditional regression models were used to estimate odds ratios adjusting potential confounders. The results suggested that nsaids use during ari episodes was associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk of stroke (ischemic: adjusted odds ratio, aor 2.27, 95% confidence interval, 95% ci, 2.00-2.58; hemorrhagic: aor 2.28, 95% ci, 1.71-3.02). We also determined that parenteral nsaids were associated with much higher risk of stroke in patients with ari. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use during ari episodes, especially parenteral nsaids use, was associated with a further increased risk of stroke.",29659118

Internationally, prescribing practice in hf may deviate from guidelines and so a standardised tool is required to assess prescribing quality. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to identify a quantitative tool for measuring adherence to hf guidelines and its clinical implications. Eleven electronic databases were searched to include studies reporting a comprehensive tool for measuring adherence to prescribing guidelines in hf patients aged ≥18 years. Qualitative studies or studies measuring prescription rates alone were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the good research for comparative effectiveness checklist. In total, 2455 studies were identified. Sixteen eligible full-text articles were included (n = 14 354 patients, mean age 69 ± 8 y). The guideline adherence index (gai), and its modified versions, was the most frequently cited tool (n = 13). Other tools identified were the individualised reconciled evidence recommendations, the composite heart failure performance, and the heart failure scale. The meta-analysis included the gai studies of good to high quality. The average gai-3 was 62%. Compared to low gai, high gai patients had lower mortality rate (7.6% vs 33.9%) and lower rehospitalisation rates (23.5% vs 24.5%); both p ≤ .05. High gai was associated with reduced risk of mortality (hazard ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.51) and rehospitalisation (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.00). No tool was used to improve prescribing quality. The gai is the most frequently used tool to assess guideline adherence in hf. High gai is associated with improved hf outcomes.",29659109

A time-series epidemiological study in a coruña, spain.",Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4427,"The consumption of medication, especially over-the-counter drugs, can reflect environmental exposure with a lesser degree of severity in terms of morbidity. The non-linear effects of maximum and minimum apparent temperature on respiratory drug sales in a coruña from 2006 to 2010 were examined using a distributed lag nonlinear model. In particular, low apparent temperatures proved to be associated with increased sales of respiratory drugs. The strongest consistent risk estimates were found for minimum apparent temperatures in respiratory drug sales with an increase of 33.4% (95% ci, 12.5%-58.0%) when the temperature changed from 2.8°c to -1.4 °c. These findings may serve to guide the planning of public health interventions to predict and manage the health effects of exposure to the thermal environment for lower degrees of morbidity. More precisely, significant increases in the use of measured over-the-counter medication could be used to identify and anticipate influenza outbreaks due to a more sensitive degree of the data source.",29655296

In 2014, underpowered, post hoc analyses of clinical trials suggested an increased risk of heart failure with the use of these products. As such, we assessed disproportionate reporting of major adverse cardiac events (mace) among reports for dpp-4i submitted to the fda adverse event reporting system (faers) from 2006 to 2015. We assessed the empirical bayes geometric mean (ebgm) and its lower bound (eb05) of the relative reporting ratio for mace among dpp-4i reports in the full faers database and in a subset of reports limited to cardiovascular and diabetic drugs. We then compared the eb05 in these 2 analyses and calculated the percent positive agreement for signals of disproportional reporting (sdrs) involving mace. Of 180.3 million adverse event reports, 13.4 million were for diabetic and cardiovascular drugs. In the cardiovascular subset, there was an sdr for heart failure with linagliptin (eb05 = 2782.47) and saxagliptin (eb05 = 2.40), myocardial infarction with alogliptin (eb05 = 290.11), and cerebral infarction with sitagliptin (eb05 = 2.80). Of the 14 mace, 8 had a percent positive agreement ≥50% for an sdr in both analyses. Overall, the cardiovascular subset elicited 11 more sdrs for dpp-4i than the full dataset. Postmarketing surveillance of dpp-4i through faers suggest increased reporting of mace, supporting the current fda warning of heart failure risk. This suggests the need for additional longitudinal, observational research into the association of dpp-4i and other mace.",29655237

We identified outpatient visits (2007-2012) with recently documented (≤180 days) cardiovascular risk and classified patients according to whether the exposure (statin) was initiated within 14 days. We selected each beneficiary's first eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during the respective look-backs: continuous enrollment (1 or 3 years for fixed look-back; 180 days for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. We estimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (hrs) for the effect of statin initiation on incident 6-month cancer (a known null effect) and 2-year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using each look-back. Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated hr from the all-available approach (hr = 0.90, 95% ci: 0.83, 0.98) was less biased than the 1-year look-back (hr = 0.79, 95% ci: 0.73, 0.84), which included beneficiaries with prevalent cancer. The 3-year look-back (hr = 1.05, 95% ci: 0.90, 1.21) was somewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due the exclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuous enrollment (62.0% and 59.9% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). All approaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality. Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding. The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the 3-year fixed, which produced the least biased point estimate. If 3-year look-backs are infeasible (eg, due to power/sample), all-available look-backs may be preferable to short (1-year) fixed look-backs.",29655187

The aim of this case-crossover study was to apply the association rules method to ascertain medication combinations contributing to the risk of fractures in older adults. A nationwide representative sample of new zealanders aged ≥65 years was sourced from the pharmaceutical collection. The first-time coded diagnosis of fracture was extracted from the national minimum dataset. Association rule method is a data mining technique that can be used to quickly traverse big datasets to identify a combination of items that co-occur. The association rules method were applied to identify frequent 11 medication combinations in the case and the control periods (1-14 days as hazard period, with 35-day washout period), and the association of fractures with each frequent medication combination were tested by computing a matched odd ratio (or) and its 95% ci. We identified a total of 72 184 individuals (mean age 81.5 years) from 2005 to 2014 with incident fracture and exposed to at least 1 medication of interest.

Our review was informed by compiling relevant literature identified through searching multiple health research databases (pubmed, embase, and cihnahl) and grey literature sources (websites, blogs, and reports). We demonstrate how pharmacoepidemiologists, in particular, may use altmetrics to understand scholarly impact and knowledge translation by providing a case study of a drug-safety study conducted by the canadian network of observational drug effect studies. A common approach to measuring research impact is the use of citation-based metrics, such as an article's citation count or a journal's impact factor. ""alternative"" metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly supported as a complementary measure of research uptake in the age of social media. Altmetrics are nontraditional indicators that capture a diverse set of traceable, online research-related artifacts including peer-reviewed publications and other research outputs (software, datasets, blogs, videos, posters, policy documents, presentations, social media posts, wiki entries, etc). Compared with traditional citation-based metrics, altmetrics take a more holistic view of research impact, attempting to capture the activity and engagement of both scholarly and nonscholarly communities. Despite the limited theoretical underpinnings, possible commercial influence, potential for gaming and manipulation, and numerous data quality-related issues, altmetrics are promising as a supplement to more traditional citation-based metrics because they can ingest and process a larger set of data points related to the flow and reach of scholarly communication from an expanded pool of stakeholders. Unlike citation-based metrics, altmetrics are not inherently rooted in the research publication process, which includes peer review; it is unclear to what extent they should be used for research evaluation.",29575351

Our objective was to assess the feasibility of adapting the daly approach for estimating adverse event burden. We developed a practical methodological framework, explicitly describing all steps involved: acquisition of relative or absolute risks and background event incidence rates, selection of disability weights and durations, and computation of the years lived with disability (yld) measure, with appropriate estimation of uncertainty. We present a worked example, in which yld is computed for 3 recognized adverse reactions following 3 childhood vaccination types, based on background incidence rates and relative/absolute risks retrieved from the literature. Yld provided extra insight into the health impact of an adverse event over presentation of incidence rates only, as severity and duration are additionally incorporated. As well as providing guidance for the deployment of daly methodology in the context of adverse events associated with vaccination, we also identified where data limitations potentially occur. Burden of disease methodology can be applied to estimate the health burden of adverse events following vaccination in a systematic way. As with all burden of disease studies, interpretation of the estimates must consider the quality and accuracy of the data sources contributing to the daly computation.",29575242

Therefore, we assessed the effect of paroxetine/fluoxetine initiation on the existing treatment with metoprolol on the discontinuation and dose adjustment of metoprolol among elderly. We performed a cohort study using the university of groningen iadb.nl prescription database (www.iadb.nl). We selected all elderly (≥60 years) who had ever been prescribed metoprolol and had a first co-prescription of paroxetine/fluoxetine, citalopram (weak cyp2d6 inhibitor), or mirtazapine (negative control) from 1994 to 2015. The exposure group was metoprolol and paroxetine/fluoxetine co-prescription, and the other groups acted as controls. The outcomes were early discontinuation and dose adjustment of metoprolol.

A regimen of 12 doses of isoniazid (inh) and rifapentine given once weekly (inh/rpt-3) has recently been recommended by the world health organization for the treatment of latent tb infection (ltbi). We aimed to determine whether the inh/rpt-3 regimen had similar or lesser rates of adverse events compared to other ltbi regimens, namely inh for 9 months, inh for 6 months, rifampin for 3 to 4 months, and rifampin plus inh for 3 to 4 months. We searched medline, embase, central, pubmed, ictrp, clinicaltrials.gov, and canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health's gray matters light for randomized, postmarketing, and comparative nonrandomized studies of patients with confirmed ltbi that reported the frequency of at least 1 adverse event of relevance for a regimen of interest. The search included studies published until march 2017. The frequencies of adverse events were extracted and are presented descriptively. Data from 23 randomized and 55 nonrandomized studies were included. Although inconsistent event reporting and high heterogeneity limited comparisons, the adverse event profile of inh/rpt-3 appeared generally favorable. Flu-like reactions were reported with an increased frequency and hepatotoxicity with a lower frequency than standard treatment. While inh/rpt-3 had an overall low frequency of adverse events compared to inh monotherapy, reporting of adverse events for many regimens was limited meaning results should be interpreted cautiously. Future studies of ltbi treatment would benefit from more complete collection and reporting of adverse events and more consistent definitions of hepatotoxicity.",29573031

August 2011 to august 2015. Two definitions were used to estimate potential off-label use: a broad definition of on-label prescribing using codes for disease indication (eg, atrial fibrillation [af]), and a restrictive definition excluding patients with conditions for which dabigatran is not indicated (eg, valvular af). Prevalence estimates under the broad definition ranged from 5.7% (cprd-hes) to 34.0% (csd-lpd) and, under the restrictive definition, from 17.4% (cprd-hes) to 44.1% (csd-lpd). For the majority of potential off-label users, no diagnosis potentially related to anticoagulant use was identified. Key methodological challenges were the limited availability of detailed clinical information, likely leading to overestimation of off-label use, and differences in the information available, which may explain the disparate prevalence estimates across data sources. Estimates of potential off-label use should be interpreted cautiously due to limitations in available information. In this context, cprd hes-linkable estimates are likely to be the most accurate.",29570897

Using the swedish national board of forensic medicine's toxicology database and the swedish national board of health and welfare's registries on causes of death, dispensed medications, and in-patient care, forensic-toxicological findings were compared with prescription-based estimates of drug use for 27 medications. We modeled expected drug-use periods with the pre2dup using an algorithm of demonstrated high validity that evaluates personal drug-purchasing patterns with consideration to possible stockpiling of drugs and package information. Excluding criteria included self-inflicted death and recent in-patient care. In data from 18 627 performed autopsies, as well as 10 160 instances of dispensed drug use, the agreement between pre2dup drug-use periods and forensic toxicology was, overall, moderate (cohen's kappa: 0.56 [95% confidence interval {ci}: 0.55-0.57]) with a positive predictive value, or predicted adherence rate, of 46.0%.

Events adjudicated by regards study investigators were used as the gold standard. Stepwise selection was used to choose predictors from medicare data for inclusion in the algorithms. C-index, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv) were used to assess algorithm performance. Net reclassification index (nri) was used to compare the algorithms with an approach of classifying all deaths within 28 days following hospitalization for myocardial infarction and stroke to be fatal cvd. Data from 2,685 regards participants with linkage to medicare, who died between 2003 and 2013, were analyzed. The c-index for discriminating fatal cvd from other causes of death was 0.87.

This study examines the role of benzodiazepine and opioid prescriptions on overdose-both individually and synergistically-using data from medicare part d, a source of prescription drug claims for about 35 million americans. Prescribing data from the medicare part d public use files for 2013, 2014, and 2015 (approximately 3.5 billion prescription drug claims) are geolocated using the prescriber's national provider identifier to calculate the proportion of claims for opioids and benzodiazepines in each county. These rates are matched with overdose data and controls to compile an analytic dataset of 9105 county-years. Multinomial logistic regression is used to estimate the probability that a county experiences higher rates of overdose fatalities. A 1% increase in the benzodiazepine proportion of claims is associated with 1.2 odds of high, versus low, overdose (p < .1) and 1.4 odds of very high overdose (p < .05). Moreover, there was a substantial interaction between opioids and benzodiazepines (p < .001). A county with 6% benzodiazepine prescriptions and 12% opioid prescriptions has a .58 predicted probability of very high overdose, significantly higher (p < .001) than the .33 probability for a county with 12% opioid prescriptions but 3% benzodiazepine prescriptions. These findings shed light on the polydrug epidemiology of the overdose epidemic. Overdose deaths are highest where elevated opioid and benzodiazepine claims coexist. Overdose levels may reflect polydrug use and misuse, requiring clinical and policy responses beyond reducing opioid prescriptions.",29537112

We evaluated the ability of the cohort identification and descriptive analysis and propensity score matching tools to identify a higher rate of cdi among clindamycin users. We matched new users of outpatient dispensings of oral clindamycin or penicillin from 13 data partners 1:1 on propensity score and followed them for up to 60 days for development of cdi. We used cox proportional hazards regression stratified by data partner and matched pair to compare cdi incidence. Propensity score models at 3 data partners had convergence warnings and a limited range of predicted values. We excluded these data partners despite adequate covariate balance after matching. From the 10 data partners where these models converged without warnings, we identified 807 919 new clindamycin users and 8 815 441 new penicillin users eligible for the analysis.

Among drugs with pregnancy exposure registries, use was less during pregnancy compared with before pregnancy and to the matched nonpregnant episodes. The lower utilization during pregnancy suggests that women may be avoiding these drugs to minimize potentially harmful exposure during pregnancy. This lower utilization may increase the challenges of further studying the safety of these drugs using pregnancy exposure registries.",29516585

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the marketscan commercial claims and encounters database including adult men who initiated a pde5 inhibitor (n = 377,722) and 1,957,233 nonusers between 1998 and 2007. Periods of drug exposure were assessed on a weekly basis based on pharmacy billing records, assuming use of 1 dose per week (current use). Incident sudden snhl was defined based on inpatient or outpatient visits with international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification codes 389.1x, 389.2x, or 388.2 plus ≥2 procedure codes for audiometric hearing testing within ±30 days of sudden snhl diagnosis. We used age- and propensity score-adjusted cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the risk of sudden snhl during periods of current or recent use compared with that of nonuse. We conducted sensitivity analyses by varying the assumed drug utilization frequency and sudden snhl case definition. We evaluated 1233 sudden snhl cases, resulting in an incidence of 4.35, 5.58, and 2.38 per 10,000 person-years for current, recent, and nonuse of pde5 inhibitors, respectively. Compared with nonuse, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.25 (1.01-1.55) for current use with a risk difference of 1.97 (1.12-2.82) per 10,000 person-years. For recent use, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.60 (1.33-1.94) and risk difference was 3.19 (2.24-4.14). Estimates were consistent across the sensitivity analyses. Use of pde5 inhibitors is associated with a small but significantly increased risk of sudden snhl.",29512263

We performed an interrupted time series analysis using pharmaceutical benefits scheme claims data (july 2005 to december 2015). We assessed the impact of both policies on monthly quetiapine dispensing (25 mg and >25 mg) and the impact of policy change 2 on monthly rates of 25-mg discontinuation and switching from 25 mg to other quetiapine strengths. We also estimated the impact of both policies on the proportion of people with potentially inappropriate therapy (no evidence of dose escalation) following 25-mg initiation. Following removal of prior authorisation, 25-mg and >25-mg quetiapine dispensing in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme 10% sample increased by 11/month (95% ci: 2-21) and 14/month (95% ci: 8-20), respectively. After removing 25-mg repeats, there was a permanent decrease of 1072 (95% ci 773-1371) dispensings and an increase in discontinuation of this strength; 48% of people dispensed the 25-mg strength that discontinued, discontinued quetiapine completely; the remainder continued to use higher quetiapine strengths. We observed minimal switching to other quetiapine strengths. There was no change in inappropriate 25-mg therapy following policy change 1 and a small decrease (79% to 76%, p = 0.05) following policy change 2. More nuanced policies are needed to ensure the appropriate access to 25-mg quetiapine for dose escalation while discouraging use for indications where the evidence of risk and benefit is unclear.",29493050

Time-varying cumulative exposure to ppis was determined from automated pharmacy data by summing standard daily doses (sdds) across fills, and patients were categorized as no use (reference group, ≤30 sdd), light use (31-540 sdd), moderate use (541-1080 sdd), and heavy use (≥1081 sdd). Incident fractures were assessed using international classification of diseases, ninth revision codes from electronic medical records. Potential confounders, chosen a priori, were assessed at baseline and at each 2-year follow-up visit. Fracture risk was analyzed using a cox proportional hazards model. Over a mean follow-up of 6.1 years, 802 (18.1%) participants experienced a fracture. No overall association was found between ppi use and fracture risk. Adjusted hazard ratios comparing users to the referent category were 1.08 (95% ci 0.83-1.40) for light users, 1.31 (95% ci 0.86-1.95) for moderate users, and 0.95 (95% ci 0.68-1.34) for heavy users.

Incidence rates and hazard ratio of chf were estimated for patients with and without icodextrin treatment by the end of 2011. Among pd patients, icodextrin users had an overall 26% lower incidence of chf than non-users (13.7 vs 18.6 per 1000 person-years).

We used quintilesims lrx lifelink data to identify patients receiving prescription opioids in florida (intervention state, n: 1.13 million) and georgia (control state, n: 0.54 million). The preintervention, intervention, and postintervention periods were july 2010 to june 2011, july 2011 to september 2011, and october 2011 to september 2012. We identified 3 types of high-risk patients: (1) concomitant users: patients with concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids; (2) chronic users: long-term, high-dose, opioid users; and (3) opioid shoppers: patients receiving opioids from multiple sources. We compared changes in opioid prescriptions between florida and georgia before and after policy implementation among high-risk/low-risk patients. Our monthly measures included (1) average morphine milligram equivalent per transaction, (2) total opioid volume across all prescriptions, (3) average days supplied per transaction, and (4) total number of opioid prescriptions dispensed. Among opioid-receiving individuals in florida, 6.62% were concomitant users, 1.96% were chronic users, and 0.46% were opioid shoppers. Following policy implementation, florida's high-risk patients experienced relative reductions in morphine milligram equivalent (opioid shoppers: -1.08 mg/month, 95% confidence interval [ci] -1.62 to -0.54), total opioid volume (chronic users: -4.58 kg/month, ci -5.41 to -3.76), and number of dispensed opioid prescriptions (concomitant users: -640 prescriptions/month, ci -950 to -340).

We sought to compare self-report to prescription records to understand how reliably each of these sources of information may be used. We compared self-reported medication use in the 6 months prior to pregnancy from fathers participating in the norwegian mother and child cohort study to records of dispensed prescriptions from the norwegian prescription database that overlapped in time. Medications from 3 main categories were assessed: prescription medications used chronically, prescription medications used episodically, and over-the-counter/prescription medications (predominantly obtained without prescription). We calculated agreement between self-report and dispensing records using cohen's kappa statistic. We included 42 848 pregnancies with the father's prescription data available for the 9 months before pregnancy. Prescription medications used chronically including antiepileptics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants showed substantial agreement between self-report and prescription records: kappa statistics 0.87, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively. Prescription medications used episodically like anti-infectives, opioids, anxiolytics, and hypnotics and sedatives showed worse agreement: kappa 0.19, 0.32, 0.40, 0.32. Over-the-counter/prescription medications like paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had slight agreement: kappa 0.02 and 0.20. There is good agreement between paternal self-report and prescription data for prescribed medications used chronically and substantially less for medications used episodically. Suboptimal agreement for episodic medications suggests poor recall (for questionnaires) or false positives due to noncompliance (prescription data). Not surprisingly, use of medications available both with and without a prescription is not well captured using prescription databases alone.",29488294

This study included pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis who enrolled in the mothertobaby autoimmune diseases in pregnancy study (2003-2014) before gestational week 20 and reported prednisone use without another oral glucocorticoid during pregnancy (n = 254). Information on medication use and pregnancy outcomes was collected by telephone interview plus by medical record review. Prednisone daily dose and cumulative dose were plotted by gestational day using a heat map for each individual. K-means clustering was used to cluster individual trajectories of prednisone dose into groups. The associations between trajectory group and demographics, disease severity measured by the health assessment questionnaire at enrollment, and gestational length were evaluated. Women used prednisone 3 to 292 days during pregnancy, with daily doses ranging from <1 to 60 mg. Total cumulative dose ranged from 8 to 6225 mg. Disease severity, non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug use, and gestational length varied significantly by trajectory group. After adjusting for disease severity, non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug use, and other covariates, the highest vs lowest daily dose trajectory group was associated with reduced gestational age at delivery (β: -2.3 weeks (95%: -3.4, -1.3)), as was the highest vs lowest cumulative dose trajectory group (β: -2.6 weeks (95%: -3.6, -1.5)).

Data for all treatment settings, private and public, for the years 2009 to 2016, were extracted from the israel ministry of health's pharmaceutical administration database. The data were used to calculate defined daily doses (ddd) per 1000 inhabitants per day, of the various drugs. Consumption of the 5 opioids increased by 68%, from 3.40 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day in 2009 to 5.72 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day in 2016. This trend resulted mostly from increases in oxycodone consumption from 0.50 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 2.03 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (namely, 4-fold) and in fentanyl consumption, from 1.09 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 2.33 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (about 2-fold). The use of the 3 remaining opioids decreased substantially as follows: pethidine from 0.03 ddd/1000/day in 2009 to 0.007 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day in 2016 (-67%), methadone from 1.61 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 1.20 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (-25%), and morphine from 0.17 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day to 0.15 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day (-12%). An increasing trend was also observed in the use of oxycodone/naloxone (targin) and oxycodone/acetaminophen (percocet) combinations, while a decrease was observed in the use of pure oxycodone formulations. The increase in opioid consumption persisted throughout the years 2009 to 2016. This has been associated with substantial changes in the patterns of prescribing opioids, characterized by increases in oxycodone and fentanyl prescriptions and decreases in morphine, methadone, and pethidine prescriptions.

Whether the increased risk of sle is substance-specific or a class effect involving all arbs is uncertain. The aim of this study is to assess the risk of enteropathy associated with arbs and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ace-i) by using data from large administrative and claim databases. We obtained data from italian local health-care units and a large german claim database and included patients treated with olmesartan, other arbs, and ace-i. In the absence of a specific diagnosis code for sle, international classification of diseases codes for im were used. Analysis implemented a poisson regression with robust error variance procedure, which allowed accounting for different clusters (local health-care units and countries) and correctly estimating the standard error for the relative risk of rare event occurrence. Patients were divided into 3 groups: olmesartan (25.591, 5.5%), other arbs (104.901, 22.5%), and ace-i patients (334.951, 72.0%). Baseline characteristics were similar overall. The incidence of unspecified im in ace-i patients was not different compared with that of olmesartan, whereas a higher rate ratio was observed when comparing arb patients with the olmesartan group (rr: 2.50, 95% ci 1.21 to 5.19, p .01). When international classification of diseases codes for coeliac disease were included, no differences were observed. We could not confirm previous findings of a higher risk of malabsorption in olmesartan-only patients, and drug-induced enteropathy should be considered the result of exposure to the class of arbs rather than a specific drug-related effect.",29457309

As part of an assessment of thromboembolic adverse event risk following treatment with intravenous immune globulin, charts were obtained for 103 potential post-intravenous immune globulin ami cases. Charts were abstracted by trained nurses and physician-adjudicated based on prespecified diagnostic criteria. Acute myocardial infarction status could be determined for 89 potential cases. The ppvs for the inpatient ami diagnoses recorded in the sdd were 75% overall (95% ci, 65-84%), 93% (95% ci, 78-99%) for principal-position diagnoses, 88% (95% ci, 72-97%) for secondary diagnoses, and 38% (95% ci, 20-59%) for position-unspecified diagnoses (eg, diagnoses originating from separate physician claims associated with an inpatient stay). Of the confirmed ami cases, demand ischemia was the suspected etiology more often for those coded in secondary or unspecified positions (72% and 40%, respectively) than for principal-position ami diagnoses (21%). The ppvs for principal and secondary ami diagnoses were high and similar to estimates from prior chart validation studies. Position-unspecified diagnosis codes were less likely to represent true ami cases.",29446185

Traditional pharmacovigilance techniques used in vaccine safety are generally geared to detecting aes based on pre-defined sets of conditions or diagnoses. Using a newly developed tree-temporal scan statistic data mining method, we performed a pilot study to evaluate the safety profile of the meningococcal conjugate vaccine menactra® (menacwy-d), screening thousands of potential ae diagnoses and diagnosis groupings. The study cohort included enrolled participants in the vaccine safety datalink aged 11 to 18 years who had received menacwy-d vaccination(s) between 2005 and 2014.

We detected signals for 2 groups of outcomes: diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, fever, and urticaria. Both groups are known aes following menacwy-d vaccination. We also identified a statistical signal for pleurisy, but further examination suggested it was likely a false signal. No new menacwy-d safety concerns were raised.

The recommended childhood immunization schedule includes multiple vaccines in a visit. A key concern is safety of concomitant (same day) versus separate day vaccination. This paper addresses a methodological challenge for observational studies using a self-controlled design to investigate the safety of concomitant vaccination. We propose a process for distinguishing which of several concomitantly administered vaccines is responsible for increased risk of an adverse event while adjusting for confounding due to relationships between effect modifying risk factors and concomitant vaccine combinations. We illustrate the approach by re-examining the known increase in risk of seizure 7 to 10 days after measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccination and evaluating potential independent or modifying effects of other vaccines. Initial analyses suggested that dtap had both an independent and potentiating effect on seizure. After accounting for the relationship between age at vaccination and vaccine combination, there was little evidence for increased risk of seizure with same day administration of dtap and mmr; incidence rate ratio, 95% confidence interval 1.2 (0.9-1.6), p value = θ.226. We have shown that when using a self-controlled design to investigate safety of concomitant vaccination, it can be critically important to adjust for time-invariant effect modifying risk factors, such as age at time of vaccination, which are structurally related to vaccination patterns due to recommended immunization schedules.",29441647

A total of 5280 participants, men and women of various race/ethnicities from multiple sites across the united states, were considered in the current study. The adherence adjusted total relative risk reduction (rrr) estimate (95% confidence interval) of statins on chd was 14% (-16%, 37%), and the indirect component through ldl was 23% (-4%, 58%).

The total rrr of mortality was 18% (-1%, 35%), and the indirect component through ldl was -4% (-17%, 12%). The estimated indirect components through hdl and triglycerides were close to zero with narrow confidence intervals for all 3 outcomes. The estimated effect of statins on mortality, cvd, and chd appeared to be independent of their estimated effect on hdl and triglycerides. Our study provides evidence that the preventive effect of statins on chd could be attributed in large part to their effect on ldl.

Sensitivity ranged from 0.48 for primary position only to 0.63 when definition included any discharge code position. The sensitivity of definitions including codes 410 and 411.1 were higher than sensitivity observed when using code 410 alone. Specificity of these alternate definitions was higher for women (0.98) than for men (0.96).

Outcomes evaluated before and after label change were ppi dispensing patterns, incident fractures, and osteoporosis screening or interventions. Consistent with fda use of descriptive tools, we did not include direct comparisons or statistical testing. There were 1 488 869 and 2 224 420 incident ppi users in the before [pre] and after [post] periods, respectively. Users with 1 year or more of exposure decreased (8.4% vs 7.5%), as did mean days supplied/user (130.4 to 113.7 d among all users and 830.8 to 645.4 d among users with 1 y or more of exposure). Osteoporosis screening and interventions did not appear to increase, but the proportion of patients with fractures decreased (4.4% vs 3.1%). Prevalent user results were similar. This analysis demonstrated the ability to use sentinel tools to assess the effectiveness of a label change and accompanying communication at the population level and suggests an influence on subsequent dispensing behavior.",29392851

We identified new initiators of warfarin or dabigatran with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in 2 healthcare claims databases (2009-2013) and used gbm within 1 data source (development cohort) to explore subgroups where their effect on thromboembolism and major bleeding may differ. Identified subgroups were evaluated in the second data source (validation cohort) with stabilized-inverse-probability-of-treatment weights to adjust for confounding. Development and validation cohorts included 13 624 (28% dabigatran) and 62 596 (29% dabigatran) initiators, respectively. In development data, the strongest exposure interactions were prior thromboembolism and renal disease. In validation data, reduction in thromboembolism with dabigatran was greater for patients with versus without a history of thromboembolism by 2.8 (95% ci, -0.5 to 5.4) events per 100 patient-years. Major bleeding was reduced by 1.6/100 patient-years for dabigatran compared to warfarin initiators, without evidence of variation by renal disease. We explored use of gbm to identify potential subgroups with different treatment effect. Dabigatran's superiority to warfarin at prevention of thromboembolism may be greater in secondary than primary prevention. In practice, secondary prevention patients are more often treated with warfarin.",29383858

While many analytical methods have been developed for dealing with this challenge, they appear under-utilized, perhaps due to the complexity and varied requirements for implementation. Thus, there is an unmet need to improve understanding the appropriate course of action to address unmeasured confounding under a variety of research scenarios. We implemented a stepwise search strategy to find articles discussing the assessment of unmeasured confounding in electronic literature databases. Identified publications were reviewed and characterized by the applicable research settings and information requirements required for implementing each method. We further used this information to develop a best practice recommendation to help guide the selection of appropriate analytical methods for assessing the potential impact of unmeasured confounding. Over 100 papers were reviewed, and 15 methods were identified. We used a flowchart to illustrate the best practice recommendation which was driven by 2 critical components: (1) availability of information on the unmeasured confounders; and (2) goals of the unmeasured confounding assessment. Key factors for implementation of each method were summarized in a checklist to provide further assistance to researchers for implementing these methods. When assessing comparative effectiveness or safety in observational research, the impact of unmeasured confounding should not be ignored. Instead, we suggest quantitatively evaluating the impact of unmeasured confounding and provided a best practice recommendation for selecting appropriate analytical methods.",29383840

We estimated the association between new statin use and 10-year remodeling of the left ventricle. The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis collected data on statin use over approximately 10 years, conducting cardiac magnetic resonance (cmr) imaging at baseline and the 10-year exam. Participants were free of baseline cardiovascular disease, and we excluded users of statins at baseline. Statin initiation was defined as a report of current use at any of the 4 subsequent exams. Primary outcomes were the change in left ventricular mass index (lvmi; % predicted by height, weight, and sex) and mass-to-volume ratio. Associations were estimated in a propensity score-matched analysis. A total of 3113 participants (53% female; 40% european-american, 25% african-american, 22% hispanic-american, and 13% chinese-american) were eligible; 2431 returned for follow-up cmr imaging after a median of 9.4 years. Statin therapy (moderate dose, 76%) was started by 36% of participants (n = 872). We excluded 42 participants with incident myocardial infarction. Compared with nonuse, statin use was associated with less 10-year progression in lvmi (-2.35 percentage points; 95% ci, -4.24 to -0.47; p = .01) and mass-to-volume ratio (-0.03 absolute difference; 95% ci, -0.07 to -0.00; p = .02); effects were small in magnitude. A dose response was observed: higher statin dose was associated with less lvmi progression. In contrast to previous small studies, we found very modest associations between statin use and indices of left ventricular remodeling over 10 years in this prospective study of a diverse cohort.",29380457

We determined prevalence of nsaid dosing exceeding the daily limit (edl) and identified related user characteristics and dosing patterns among current ibuprofen users. Online 1-week diary study of 1326 ibuprofen users. Nsaids were identified by list-based prompting; respondents were not required to know their medications were nsaids. Details of hourly use were recorded by respondents daily. Deviations from dosing directions were programmatically determined afterwards. An exit survey obtained information on demographics, medical history, physical and mental health status, attitudes regarding label reading and dosing behavior, and knowledge of product label instructions. Most diary users (90%) took over-the-counter ibuprofen during the week; 37% also took non-ibuprofen nsaids. Most did not recognize all products taken as nsaids. Edl occurred among 11% of users for ibuprofen, 4% of users for other nsaids, and on 9.1% of nsaid usage days. Edl was associated with deviations from detailed dosing directions, particularly exceeding the 1-time dose, which occurred more often with medications with 1-pill doses. Personal characteristics associated with edl included male sex, ongoing pain, poor physical function, daily smoking, having the attitudes of ""choosing my own dose"" and not starting with the lowest dose, and poor knowledge of the recommended 1-time and 24-hour doses. The prevalence of edl among nsaid users is nontrivial, and it is associated with potentially modifiable factors. Educating consumers about nsaids and their dosing directions could reduce excess dosing.",29372579

We wished to determine if there was a link between rhabdomyolysis and 5ari usage. We used a matched cohort design and linked administrative data from the province of ontario, canada, to investigate the risk of rhabdomyolysis in men using either finasteride or dutasteride. A total of 99 covariates were measured. We identified 93 197 men ≥66 years of age who initiated a new prescription for a 5ari, and they were matched using a propensity score to an equal number of men not prescribed a 5ari. New initiation of 5aris was not associated with a significantly increased risk of rhabdomyolysis (hazard ratio [hr] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.00-1.48, p = .06). When we examined the risk of rhabdomyolysis in the year prior to the initiation of a 5ari, we found that men who would go on to use a 5ari in the future had an elevated risk of rhabdomyolysis even prior to starting the medication (hr 1.31, 95% ci, 1.05-1.64, p = .01). Our secondary outcome of myositis and myopathy was significantly higher among 5ari users (hr 1.63, 95% ci, 1.48-1.80, p < .01), and this risk was not present prior to 5ari usage. 5-α reductase inhibitors do not appear to be associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis; however, they may be associated with an increased risk of myopathy and myositis.",29368380

We conducted a population-based, serial cross-sectional study of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing from community pharmacies across canada between october 2007 and april 2016. We calculated rates of dispensing (tablets per 100 population) and reported the relative market share of generic non-tamper-deterrent controlled-release oxycodone. All analyses were reported nationally and stratified by province. After the introduction of a tamper-deterrent formulation, the national rate of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing fell by 44.6% (from 26.4 to 14.6 tablets per 100 population from february 2012 to april 2016). Between december 2012 and july 2013, there was moderate uptake of generic non-tamper-deterrent controlled-release oxycodone (968 452 tablets; 16.0% in july 2013), which appeared to have little impact on the overall rate of controlled-release oxycodone dispensing in canada. However, the uptake of generic non-tamper-deterrent oxycodone varied considerably by province. By april 2016, 55.0% of all controlled-release oxycodone tablets dispensed in quebec were for the generic formulation. Elsewhere in canada, this prevalence was less than 30%, ranging between 1.6% (prince edward island) and 26.9% (british columbia) at the end of our study period. The changing availability of tamper-deterrent and non-tamper-deterrent formulations of controlled-release oxycodone in canada has had variable influence on the rate of use of these products across canada. Future research should explore whether the availability of generic controlled-release oxycodone has led to measurable changes in the safety of oxycodone use in canada.",29359446

Patients with hypertension, without cardiovascular comorbidity, aged >30 years treated with ≥3 antihypertensive drug classes were followed for 2 years. Both patients with treatment resistant hypertension (trh) and patients with controlled hypertension were included. Clinical data were derived from a primary care database. Pharmacy refill data from the swedish prescribed drug registry was used to calculate proportion of days covered (pdc). Patients with a pdc level ≥ 80% were included. We found 5846 patients treated ≥3 antihypertensive drug classes, 3508 with trh (blood pressure ≥ 140/90), and 2338 with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mm hg). Trh patients were older (69.1 vs 65.8 years, p < .0001) but had less diabetes (28.5 vs 31.7%, p < .009) compared with patients with controlled blood pressure. The proportion of patients with pdc ≥ 80% declined with 11% during the first year in both groups.

Food and drug administration.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4386,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate contributions to postmarket safety assessments and identify potential factors for enhancing implementation and utilization of registries in regulatory decision-making. Registry documents (e.g., protocols, reports) submitted to the fda were identified up to january 2016 through an extensive, systematic review of internal records and resources. We characterized nonpregnancy drug exposure registries based on prespecified design elements, performance, and regulatory impact. A total of 65 registries were identified: 56 registries were open and 9 closed. Among open registries, 20% were pending, 14% delayed, and 16% ongoing less than ≤3 years. Most registries (82%) examined safety issues that originally arose from clinical trials; most frequent safety issues investigated included infections, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and liver toxicity. Although 74% of registries ascertained baseline health conditions and monitored concomitant medication use, fewer (45%) considered drug exposure duration or dosage. Thirty-seven percent of non pending registries had enrollment below sample size expectation. Seventeen registries published findings in journals/conference proceedings, 13 from open registries. Three closed registries generated results that contributed to product label changes. High-performance registries scored higher in design metrics related to sample size considerations (76% versus 62%) and adequate analysis plan (53% versus 35%), and interim report submission (76% versus 65%). There was a significant difference in proportion of registries with clear primary objectives between high versus not high performing registries (100% versus 78%). This study suggests clear objectives, patient accrual/retention efforts, adequate analysis plans, and interim reports contribute to the performance of drug exposure registries.",29349833

These studies are restricted to live births due to a reliance on algorithms for estimating gestational age that are based on codes associated with live delivery. Conditioning on live birth may induce selection bias when studying the effect of a drug on a pregnancy complication if fetal death is a competing risk for the complication or is caused by the complication. We simulated a population of 100,000 pregnancies and estimated the impact of selection bias on relative estimates for the effect of antidepressant exposure on the outcome of preeclampsia. We assumed that the exposure, outcome, and covariates increased the risk of fetal loss. A downward bias in the risk ratio was consistently observed when conditioning on live births. When an unmeasured covariate was assumed to be a common cause of fetal death, antidepressant use, and preeclampsia, the direction of bias varied depending on the strength of the confounding relationship coupled with the selection bias. Despite the very low prevalence of stillbirth, the strength of the relationship between antidepressant use and stillbirth had a substantial impact on bias. Conditioning on live birth can be problematic when studying pregnancy complications. Simple quantitative selection bias analysis in populations restricted to live births may not fully account for selection bias.",29341340

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of older (aged 66+) home care clients in ontario, canada, using linked administrative health and clinical databases. Included were clients with dementia and/or significant cognitive impairment assessed during april 2008 to march 2013. Frailty was defined using a validated 72-item index. Exposed were those newly dispensed an antipsychotic in the 6 months post cohort entry, with no such claims in the year prior to drug index date. Two-stage matching defined unexposed clients and their index date (matching on age, sex, frailty, assessment year, and propensity score). Outcome was time to death following index date. Cause-specific hazards models were used, and number needed to harm at 6 months was estimated from cumulative incidence function curves. Among 4955 matched exposed-unexposed pairs, new antipsychotic users showed a significantly increased hazard of mortality at 1, 3, and 6 months relative to unexposed, with the highest risk observed in the first month (hazard ratio [hr] = 2.08 [95% ci, 1.79-2.43]).

We sought to quantify this association by meta-analysis of observational studies. We systematically reviewed observational studies published through august 2016 and reported the kc risk (basal cell carcinoma [bcc] and squamous cell carcinoma [scc]) associated with antihypertensive drugs, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs), beta-adrenergic blocking agents (β-blockers), and calcium channel blockers (ccbs). Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (or) with 95% confidence interval (ci). Ten eligible studies were included. Compared with nonuse, diuretic use was significantly associated with increased risk of both bcc (or, 1.10; 95% ci, 1.01-1.20) and scc (or, 1.40; 95% ci, 1.19-1.66). Use of β-blockers or ccbs was associated with increased risk of bcc (but not scc); the or with β-blockers was 1.09 (95% ci, 1.04-1.15) and with ccbs was 1.15 (95% ci, 1.09-1.21). Use of ace inhibitors or arbs was associated with decreased risk of both bcc (or, 0.53; 95% ci, 0.39-0.71) and scc (or, 0.58; 95% ci, 0.42-0.80) in high-risk individuals. Current evidence indicates that use of diuretics might be associated with increased risk of kc, while ace inhibitors or arbs might be associated with decreased risk in high-risk individuals. β-blockers or ccbs might be positively associated with bcc risk.

Using electronic health record data from oncology practices across the us, we identified prostate cancer patients diagnosed with bone metastasis in 2012/2013 without evidence of bta use within 6 months prior to diagnosis. We examined the risk and predictors of bta initiation, interruption, and re-initiation. Among 897 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, the cumulative incidence of bta initiation after bone metastasis diagnosis was 34% (95% confidence interval [ci], 31-37%) at 30 days, 64% (95% ci, 61-68%) at 180 days, and 88% (95% ci, 85-91%) at 2 years. Denosumab was initiated more frequently than zoledronic acid. Men with diabetes, more bone lesions, history of androgen deprivation therapy, or no hospice enrollment were more likely to initiate treatment. Following initiation, the cumulative incidence of treatment interruption was 17% (95% ci, 14-19%) at 60 days and 70% (95% ci, 66-74%) at 2 years, with interruption more likely among patients receiving emerging therapies for prostate cancer or enrolling in hospice.

Because α1-adrenoceptors are also present in the brain, the potential exists for adverse effects on cognitive functions. We explored the association between tamsulosin use and dementia risk. We used medicare data (2006-2012) to conduct a cohort study among patients aged ≥65 years and diagnosed with bph. Men taking tamsulosin (n = 253 136) were matched at a 1:1 ratio using propensity-scores to each of 6 comparison cohorts: patients who used no bph-medication (n = 180 926), and patients who used the following alternative-bph-medications: doxazosin (n = 28 581), terazosin (n = 23 858), alfuzosin (n = 17 934), dutasteride (n = 34 027), and finasteride (n = 38 767). Assessment began following the first fill of bph-medication to identify incident dementia by icd-9 diagnosis codes. We estimated hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) for dementia using cox proportional hazard regression for each of the 6 propensity-score-matched cohort-pairs. The median follow-up period for all cohorts was 19.8 months. After propensity-score matching, the tamsulosin cohort had an incidence of dementia of 31.3/1000 person-years compared with only 25.9/1000 person-years in the no-bph-medication cohort. The risk of dementia was significantly higher in the tamsulosin cohort, when compared with the no-bph-medication cohort (hr [95% ci]: 1.17 [1.14, 1.21]) and each of the alternative-bph-medication cohorts: doxazosin (1.20 [1.12, 1.28]), terazosin (1.11 [1.04, 1.19]), alfuzosin (1.12 [1.03, 1.22]), dutasteride (1.26 [1.19, 1.34]), and finasteride (1.13 [1.07, 1.19]).

Our main objectives were to determine the positive predictive value for identifying type 1 diabetes in adults using a published algorithm (developed by klompas et al) and to compare it to a simple requirement that the majority of diabetes diagnosis codes be type 1. We applied the klompas algorithm and the diagnosis code criterion to a cohort of 66 690 adult kaiser permanente colorado members with diabetes. We reviewed 220 charts of those identified as having type 1 diabetes and calculated positive predictive values. The klompas algorithm identified 3286 (4.9% of 66 690) adults with diabetes as having type 1 diabetes. Based on chart reviews, the overall positive predictive value was 94.5%. The requirement that the majority of diabetes diagnosis codes be type 1 identified 3000 (4.5%) as having type 1 diabetes and had a positive predictive value of 96.4%. However, the algorithm criterion involving dispensing of urine acetone test strips performed poorly, with a positive predictive value of 20.0%. Data from electronic health records can be used to accurately identify adults with type 1 diabetes. When identifying adults with type 1 diabetes, we recommend either a modified version of the klompas algorithm without the urine acetone test strips criterion or the requirement that the majority of diabetes diagnosis codes be type 1 codes.",29292555

Such studies could be biased by outcome misclassification, leading to incorrect inferences. Using simulations, we evaluated (1) outcome positive predictive values (ppvs) as indicators of bias of an exposure-outcome association, and (2) quantitative bias analyses (qba) for bias correction. Simulations were conducted based on proposed or ongoing vaccine safety datalink studies. We simulated 4 studies of 2 exposure groups (children with no vaccines or on alternative schedules) and 2 baseline outcome levels (100 and 1000/100 000 person-years), with 3 relative risk (rr) levels (rr = 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00), across 1000 replications using probabilistic modeling. We quantified bias from non-differential and differential outcome misclassification, based on levels previously measured in database research (sensitivity > 95%; specificity > 99%). We calculated median outcome ppvs, median observed rrs, type 1 error, and bias-corrected rrs following qba. We observed ppvs from 34% to 98%. With non-differential misclassification and true rr = 2.00, median bias was toward the null, with severe bias (median observed rr = 1.33) with ppv = 34% and modest bias (median observed rr = 1.83) with ppv = 83%. With differential misclassification, ppvs did not reflect median bias, and there was type 1 error of 100% with ppv = 90%. Qba was generally effective in correcting misclassification bias. In immunization schedule studies, outcome misclassification may be non-differential or differential to exposure. Overall outcome ppvs do not reflect the distribution of false positives by exposure and are poor indicators of bias in individual studies. Our results support qba for immunization schedule safety research.",29292551

The aim of this study is to provide an overview and guidance on some of the available methodologies used to address problems related to time-varying exposure and confounding in pharmacoepidemiology and other observational studies. The methods are explored from a conceptual rather than an analytical perspective. The methods described in this study have been identified exploring the literature concerning to the time-varying exposure concept and basing the search on four fundamental pharmacoepidemiological problems, construction of treatment episodes, time-varying confounders, cumulative exposure and latency, and treatment switching. A correct treatment episodes construction is fundamental to avoid bias in treatment effect estimates. Several methods exist to address time-varying covariates, but the complexity of the most advanced approaches-eg, marginal structural models or structural nested failure time models-and the lack of user-friendly statistical packages have prevented broader adoption of these methods. Consequently, simpler methods are most commonly used, including, for example, methods without any adjustment strategy and models with time-varying covariates. The magnitude of exposure needs to be considered and properly modelled. Further research on the application and implementation of the most complex methods is needed. Because different methods can lead to substantial differences in the treatment effect estimates, the application of several methods and comparison of the results is recommended. Treatment episodes estimation and exposure quantification are key parts in the estimation of treatment effects or associations of interest.",29285840

Many studies have used a single population-adjusted metric (number of dispensings, defined daily doses [ddds], or oral morphine equivalents [omes]). We combine these volume-based metrics with a measure of the number of persons dispensed opioids to gain insights into australian trends in prescribed opioid use. We obtained records of prescribed opioid dispensings (2006-2015) subsidised under australia's pharmaceutical benefits scheme. We used dispensing claims to quantify annual changes in use according to 3 volume-based metrics: ddd/1000 pop/day, ome/1000 pop/day, and dispensings/1000 pop. We estimated the number of persons dispensed at least one opioid in a given year (persons)/1000 pop using data from a 10% random sample of pharmaceutical benefits scheme-eligible australians. Total opioid use increased according to all metrics, especially ome/1000 pop/day (51% increase) and dispensings/1000 pop (44%). Weaker opioid use remained stable or declined; strong opioid use increased. The rate of persons accessing weaker opioids only decreased 31%, and there was a 238% increase in persons dispensed only strong opioids. Strong opioid use also increased according to dispensings/1000 pop (140%), ome/1000 pop/day (80%), and ddd/1000 pop/day (71% increase). Our results suggest that the increases in total opioid use between 2006 and 2015 were predominantly driven by a growing number of people treated with strong opioids at lower medicine strengths/doses. This method can be used with or without person-level data to provide insights into factors driving changes in medicine use over time.",29280224

A larger pre-approval exposed population is supposed to reduce the risk of unanticipated safety issues post-approval. The amount of use in the postapproval population is also expected to influence the occurrence and timing of safety issues. We investigated how the amount of pre and post approval exposure influences the detection of post-approval safety issues. A cohort of innovative drugs approved in europe was followed for the period of 2012-2016. The main outcome of interest was a new safety issue in the period. Post-approval exposure was collected at 6 month intervals, and pre-approval exposure was collected at the moment of authorisation. Other characteristics collected for the included drugs were anatomical therapeutical chemical (atc) class, biological status, orphan status and type of approval. We used cox proportional hazards regression to investigate the association between exposure and the hazard of having a first safety issue. The pre-approval exposure was not associated with the risk of safety issues after adjusting for atc class, biological status, and treatment duration. Higher post-approval exposure was associated with more new safety issues identified (hr = 2.44 (95% ci = 1.12-5.31)) for drugs with more than 1,000 patient-years of cumulative exposure compared to drugs with less than 1,000 patient years of exposure.

We used 2013 to 2015 data for 9 202 958 patients aged 18 to 64 from a large nationally representative commercial health insurance program to assess the temporal trends in the monthly rate of opioid prescribing. Hcp prescribing decreased by 26% from june 2013 to june 2015; the rate of prescriptions for any opioid decreased by 11%. Prescribing of non-hydrocodone schedule iii opioids increased slightly while prescribing of non-hydrocodone schedule ii opioids and tramadol was stable. Absolute decreases in hcp prescribing rates were larger in patients being treated for cancer (-2.26% vs -0.7% for non-cancer patients, p < 0.0001) and in those with high comorbidities (-2.13% vs -0.55% for those with no comorbidity, p < 0.0001). Differences in the absolute and relative changes in hcp prescribing rates among states were large; for example, a relative decrease of 46.7% in texas and a 12.7% increase in south dakota. The variation in hcp prescribing attributable to the state of residence increased from 6.6% in 2013 to 8.7% in 2015. The 2014 federal policy was associated with a decrease in rates of hcp and total opioid prescribing.

The aim of this study was to improve the efficiency of full database screening using a prediction model-based approach. A logistic regression-based prediction model containing 5 candidate predictors was developed and internally validated using the summary of product characteristics as the gold standard for the outcome. All drug-adr associations, with the exception of those related to vaccines, with a minimum of 3 reports formed the training data for the model. Performance was based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc). Results were compared with the current method of database screening based on the number of previously analyzed associations. A total of 25 026 unique drug-adr associations formed the training data for the model. The final model contained all 5 candidate predictors (number of reports, disproportionality, reports from healthcare professionals, reports from marketing authorization holders, naranjo score). The auc for the full model was 0.740 (95% ci; 0.734-0.747). The internal validity was good based on the calibration curve and bootstrapping analysis (auc after bootstrapping = 0.739). Compared with the old method, the auc increased from 0.649 to 0.740, and the proportion of potential signals increased by approximately 50% (from 12.3% to 19.4%).

Differentiating between hospitalization for and with infection is important, as the latter is common and less likely to arise from pre-admission exposure to drugs. We determined positive predictive values (ppvs) of diagnostic coding-based algorithms to identify hospitalization for infection among patients prescribed oral anti-diabetic drugs (oads). We identified patients initiating oads within 2 united states claims databases (medicare, healthcore integrated research database  [hird  ]) and 2 united kingdom electronic medical record databases (clinical practice research datalink [cprd], the health improvement network [thin]) from 2009 to 2014. To identify potential hospitalizations for infection, we selected patients with a hospital diagnosis of infection and, within 7 days prior to hospitalization, either an outpatient/emergency department visit with an infection diagnosis or outpatient antimicrobial treatment. Hospital records were reviewed by infectious disease specialists to adjudicate hospital admissions for infection. Ppvs for confirmed outcomes were determined for each database.

The goal of this study was to assess wider generalizability of the ce, using data from multiple integrated delivery networks, creating a cohort of linked mother-neonate pairs to understand neonatal outcomes in a broad population. Retrospective data on births (2001-2012) were collected from 4 us integrated delivery networks in the comparative effectiveness patient safety and surveillance (compass) research network, and linked mother-neonate pairs were identified. The ce was analyzed for all in-hospital singleton neonates at ≥24 weeks of gestational age (ga) born to mothers aged ≤45 years at a referral hospital or hospital with >2000 annual births. The ce analyses included 56 485 eligible mother-neonate pairs; frequency of the ce decreased from 89% to 66% between ga weeks 24 and 29 and further decreased to <14% for infants born >34 weeks of ga. Composite end point rates were 20% to 30% lower at 24 to 30 weeks of ga in compass compared with medical university of south carolina but were similar by 31 weeks. The compass network enabled evaluation of the ce across a large population demonstrating that the ce findings could be replicated beyond a single hospital and the potential for lower ce frequency.

We sought to synthesize the medical literature for observational studies examining the association between opioid analgesic dose and the risk of serious adverse health outcomes, with particular attention to the outcomes of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death. Searching medline using pubmed and bibliography review, we identified 22 observational studies published between 2000 and 2015 that assessed the association between opioid analgesic dose and the risk of serious adverse health outcomes. Some of these studies had significant methodological limitations. Twelve reviewed studies examined the outcomes of misuse, overdose, or death; no studies examining the risk of addiction or abuse met our criteria for inclusion. The results of multiple studies clearly indicate an increasing risk of serious adverse health outcomes associated with increasing opioid analgesic dose. In particular, the risk of misuse, overdose, and death increases with increasing opioid analgesic dose. However, there is no opioid dose inflection point beyond which the risk of these adverse health outcomes increases. No opioid analgesic dose is without risk. The reviewed studies show an increasing risk of serious adverse health outcomes-including misuse, overdose, and death-associated with increasing opioid analgesic dose. Further research is needed to characterize the relationship between opioid analgesic dose and the risk of addiction and abuse.

In-hospital, patient-level prescribing linked to indication is needed to support surveillance, evaluation of stewardship initiatives, as well as other antibiotic research. We evaluated whether a novel dataset linking hospital pharmacy records to hospital episode statistics data can be used for antibiotic research. Using the hospital treatment insights (hti) database, which links hospital episode statistics to pharmacy records from 43 out of 153 hospital trusts in england, we estimated the proportion of missed linkage and identified characteristics associated with missing data. Linkage of antibiotics to patients was inconsistent and dependent on drug type and clinical setting, so that linkage for some specific antibiotics was high (80-100%), but overall, only 27.6% (ci: 27.4%-27.8%) for all antibiotics dispensed. Linkage was best for quinolones (62.6%; ci: 61.8%-63.8%), but only 21.1% (ci: 21.1%-21.2%) for penicillins. Linkage was lower for common antibiotics and in emergency departments; however, 80% linkage was achieved for individual drugs like clindamycin, especially on wards with reduced ward stock use. For those antibiotics with high linkage, hti might be used to study associations between indication, dispensing, and outcomes. However, the majority of common antibiotics had insufficient linkage, likely due to extensive use of ward stocks. Therefore, hti in its current form is not suitable for general antibiotic surveillance or evaluation of stewardship initiatives. For drugs in hti other than antibiotics, linkage should be similarly evaluated before a study is conducted.",29230891

We investigated changes in bmd associated with new use of analgesics in a prospective longitudinal cohort of mid-life women. Bmd and medication use were measured annually. We compared bmd among new users of acetaminophen, nsaids, and opioids. Adjustment for baseline covariates was conducted through propensity score matching weights. On-treatment analysis was conducted with inverse probability of censoring weights. Analysis based on the initial treatment group was also conducted to provide insights into selection bias. Repeated bmd measurements were examined with generalized estimating equations. We identified 71 acetaminophen new users, 659 nsaid new users, and 84 opioid new users among 2365 participants. In the on-treatment analysis, the opioid group in comparison to the acetaminophen group had an additional average bmd decline of -0.06% [-1.24, 1.11] per year in the spine and -0.45% [-1.51, 0.61] per year in the femoral neck. Bmd mean trajectories over time suggested a fifth-year decline in the opioid persistent users compared with other 2 groups. In the initial treatment group analysis, all 3 groups showed similar trajectories. The bmd decline over time was similar among the 3 groups. However, 5 years of continuous opioid use may be associated with a greater bmd decline than 5 years on other analgesics.

The connectivity mapping process identified 6 potentially cancer-causing (meloxicam, azithromycin, rizatriptan, citalopram, rosiglitazone, and verapamil) and 4 potentially cancer-preventing (bendroflumethiazide, sertraline, fluvastatin, and budesonide) medications that were suitable for pharmacoepidemiological investigation. Within the uk clinical practice research datalink, we matched 45,147 breast cancer cases to 45,147 controls based on age, year, and general practice. Medication use was determined from electronic prescribing records. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ors) for the association between medication use and cancer risk after adjustment for comorbidities, lifestyle factors, deprivation, and other medication use. Bendroflumethiazide was associated with increased breast cancer risk (or: 1.11; 95% ci: 1.06, 1.15); however the connectivity mapping exercise predicted that this medication would reduce risk. There were no statistically significant associations for any of the other candidate medications, with ever use ors ranging from 0.93 (95% ci: 0.78, 1.11) for azithromycin to 1.16 (95% ci: 0.99, 1.37) for verapamil. In this instance, our combined connectivity mapping and pharmacoepidemiological approach did not identify any additional medications that were substantially associated with breast cancer risk. This could be due to limitations in the connectivity mapping, such as implausible dosage requirements, or the pharmacoepidemiology, such as residual confounding.",29205633

Trial implementation of nrtvss using the clinical practice research datalink (cprd) has shown that there is limited power to detect safety signals for rare events. Delays in recording outcomes and receiving data influence the power and timeliness to identify a signal. Our work aimed to compare how different sources of delays influence power and expected time to signal to implement nrtvss using cprd. We studied seasonal influenza vaccine/guillain-barré syndrome and performed power and expected time to signal calculations for the 2013-2014/2014-2015 seasons. We used the poisson-based maximised sequential probability ratio test, which compares observed-to-expected events. For each study season, we obtained an average guillain-barré syndrome/seizures age-sex-adjusted rate from the 5 previous seasons and then used this rate to calculate the expected number of events, assuming a 42-day risk-window. Calculations were performed for detecting rate ratios of 1.5 to 10. We compared power and timeliness considering combinations of the presence/absence of delays in recording outcomes and in receiving data. The r-package sequential was used. In general, there was ≥80% power to detect increases in risk of ≥4 at the end of the season. Assuming absence of delays slightly improved power (a maximum increase of 4%) but did not noticeably reduce time to detect a signal. Removing delays in data availability is insufficient to significantly improve the performance of a nrtvss system using cprd. Expansion of cprd data is required. Key points the clinical practice research datalink (cprd) can be used to implement near real-time vaccine safety surveillance, but there is limited power to detect signals for rare outcomes. Delays in recording outcomes and in receiving data might limit power and timeliness of a system. We assessed the influence of these sources of delays to inform data providers of the steps required to improve a system using cprd data. Removing delays in recording outcomes and receiving data is unlikely to significantly improve the performance of a system using cprd data. Expansion of the data available is needed.",29193554

However, little is known about prescription drug use for high-risk pregnancies. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of redeemed prescriptions in danish pregnant women with and without previous psychiatric history. A danish population-based descriptive study of 981 392 pregnancies ending in live-born singletons by 586 988 women aged 15 to 55 years between 1997 and 2012, of which 113 449 (11.6%) pregnancies were by women with a psychiatric history prior to the index pregnancy. All prescription drugs redeemed during pregnancy were identified, and dispensing patterns among the women were reported by therapeutic classes of drugs, calendar year of childbirth, and trimester. Overall, women with psychiatric history prior to pregnancy were more likely to fill a prescription (75.8%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 75.5-76.0%), compared with women with no psychiatric history (64.5%; 95% ci, 64.4-64.6%). The difference was observed even when psychotropic drug use was excluded and in all therapeutic classes except for antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs. The most commonly prescribed drugs were anti-infectives. Approximately 44.7% (95% ci, 44.5-45.0%) of women with psychiatric history and 31.3% (95% ci, 31.2-31.4%) of women with no psychiatric history redeemed more than one therapeutic class of drugs. Women with a psychiatric history were more likely to redeem prescriptions during pregnancy across almost all drug classes, especially anti-infectives. Two thirds of all women redeemed at least one prescription drug during pregnancy and one third more than one drug class. Key points we mapped prescription drug use of almost 600 000 women during almost one million pregnancies with focus on women with a history of psychiatric disorder before conception compared with women with no such history. Pregnant women with a previous psychiatric disorder were more likely to redeem prescription drugs compared with pregnant women without a previous psychiatric disorder. The observed overall difference was not due to obvious differences in psychotropic drug use. The difference was evident across calendar years, all trimesters, and almost all drug classes, but to a large extent in anti-infectives, among those mainly antibiotics. Two thirds of pregnant women redeemed prescription drugs during pregnancy, and one third redeemed more than one drug class. Health professionals should be aware of comorbid conditions requiring multiple drug use during pregnancy with the risk of unknown fetal effects.",29171114

This study aimed to characterize the temporal association between time-varying nsaid exposure and acute myocardial infarction (mi). Nested case-control analyses were conducted on a quebec administrative health cohort. Nsaid dose, confounders, and outcome status were determined for each day of follow-up. To better account for dose and timing of past exposures, flexible weighted cumulative exposure models were also fitted. The cohort consisted of 233 816 older adults including 21 256 acute mi cases. Dose-related increased risks of mi were found with current use of all nsaids. In models not accounting for duration of use, ors (95%ci) for the most common current daily dose vs. No current exposure were: celecoxib 200 mg: 1.16 (1.10, 1.22), diclofenac 150 mg: 1.59 (1.38, 1.84), ibuprofen 1200 mg: 1.42 (1.17, 1.74), naproxen 750 mg: 1.38 (1.21, 1.58), and rofecoxib 25 mg: 1.54 (1.43, 1.66). Weighted cumulative exposure models confirmed that all nsaids-including naproxen-are associated with an increased risk of mi and suggested that doses taken up to 3 weeks ago for rofecoxib, ibuprofen, and naproxen and up to 75 days ago for diclofenac and celecoxib may contribute to the current mi risk. However, the celecoxib risk seems to require continuous use for more than 30 days, whereas for other nsaids, a heightened mi risk occurs within 7 days. Weighted cumulative exposure analysis uncovered nsaid-specific differences in the immediate mi risk and how this risk seems to accumulate. Key points accurate assessment of drug safety requires an etiologically correct model encompassing all relevant aspects of exposure. Weighted cumulative exposure models suggest that the relative importance of past doses on the risk of mi differs among nsaids. All common nsaids are associated with an increased mi risk. Celecoxib mi risk seems to depend on continuously using the drug for more than 30 days, whereas for ibuprofen, rofecoxib, diclofenac, and naproxen, a heightened mi risk occurs within 7 days of use.",29171096

A cohort of recently relapsed patients with schizophrenia ages 18 to 64, were identified immediately after discharge from a related inpatient hospitalization, partial hospitalization, or emergency room visit, drawn from 2004 to 2006 medicaid claims, and followed for 90 days until lai initiation. Data on state-level medicaid prior authorization (pa) policies for lais were collected. Sequential longitudinal poisson regression models were developed to understand the relationship between patient and pa policy variables and lai prescribing, including prior adherence to oral antipsychotics, demographics, clinical variables, and presence of pa policy for lai. Among 36 282 patients, 3.1% received risperidone lai, and 3.8% received a first-generation (fga) lai with wide variation across states. Prior adherence ranged from 29% to 89% but was marginally associated with initiation and did not explain variation for lai prescribing. Fga initiation was associated with geography and race/ethnicity but not pa policy. For risperidone lai initiation, demographics and clinical factors explained, respectively, 5.0% and 3.0% of the variation; pa policy had a large negative association with initiation (rr = 0.41; 95%ci 0.20-0.87) and explained 8.4% of the variation. Pa policies may represent a major treatment barrier for risperidone lai among relapsed patients. Non-adherence plays a little role in predicting which patients receive lais. Policy makers and health insurers will need to consider these findings when guiding the use of lais. Key points among a nationwide cohort of relapsed schizophrenia patients enrolled in us medicaid, 3.1% received risperdal consta, a long-acting injectable antipsychotic (lai), and 3.8% initiated a first-generation first-generation lai within 90 days after discharge. During 2004 to 2006, there was marked variation in 90 day post-relapse initiation of risperdal-consta-a newly marketed medication during this period-and also marked variation in 90 day post-relapse initiation of any first-generation lai, which appeared to be associated with race/ethnicity and geography. Prior authorization policies were associated with substantially lower initiation of risperdal consta in this cohort of relapsed patients even after accounting for clinical indication (non-adherence), relapse history, demographics, adjunctive medication, and mental health service use.",29168261

Codes and unstructured text in adult electronic healthcare records (the health improvement network) were searched for a tivc brand name or batch number and possible outcomes within a 3 month pre- to 6 month post-tivc exposure study period (2012-2015). The outcomes were severe allergic reactions, bell's palsy, convulsions, demyelination, paresthesia, noninfectious encephalitis, neuritis (optic and brachial), vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and thrombocytopenia. Risk periods were defined based on biologically plausible time frame postvaccination when an outcome caused by the vaccine might be expected to occur. Possible outcomes were adjudicated against outcome specific case definitions and a date of onset assigned by using electronic and other medical records. Observed (risk period) to expected (outside risk and preexposure periods) rate ratios, postexposure incidence, and plots of time from exposure to outcome were reported. Sixteen of 1011 events from 4578 exposures fulfilled a primary case definition and had a date of onset during the study period. Three were in observed time. The observed-to-expected rate ratios were (3.3, 95% ci 0.3, 31.7) for convulsions and (1.5, 95% ci 0.2, 14.9) for thrombocytopenia with 1 outcome each in observed time. There was 1 incident inflammatory bowel disease in observed, but none in expected, time. The small sample size restricts interpretation; however, no hypothesis of an increased risk of a study outcome was generated. Adjudication of events against case definitions to reduce misclassification of onset and outcomes allowed use of precise risk periods. Key points this observational study did not generate a hypothesis of an association between the first cell-culture seasonal influenza vaccination available in the european union and any of the study outcomes (severe allergic reactions, bell's palsy, convulsions, demyelination, paresthesia, noninfectious encephalitis, neuritis [optic and brachial], vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease [ibd], and thrombocytopenia). The small sample size limits interpretation of the results. The review of each possible outcome identified from electronic healthcare records against case definitions was included to minimize misclassification of time and outcomes and allow the use of precise risk-periods in an observed-to-expected within cohort analysis.

The study was conducted in 6 large integrated health care organizations participating in the vaccine safety datalink (vsd). Trivalent laiv safety was assessed in children who received laiv between september 1, 2003 and march 31, 2013. Eighteen pre-specified adverse event groups were studied, including allergic, autoimmune, neurologic, respiratory, and infectious conditions. Incident rate ratios (irrs) were calculated for each adverse event, using self-controlled case series analyses. For adverse events with a statistically significant increase in risk, or an irr > 2.0 regardless of statistical significance, manual medical record review was performed to confirm case status. During the study period, 396 173 children received 590 018 doses of laiv. For 13 adverse event groups, there was no significant increased risk of adverse events following laiv. Five adverse event groups (anaphylaxis, syncope, stevens-johnson syndrome, adverse effect of drug, and respiratory failure) met criteria for manual medical record review. After review to confirm cases, 2 adverse event groups remained significantly associated with laiv: anaphylaxis and syncope. One confirmed case of anaphylaxis was observed following laiv, a rate of 1.7 per million laiv doses. Five confirmed cases of syncope were observed, a rate of 8.5 per million doses. In a study of trivalent laiv safety in a large cohort of children, few serious adverse events were detected. Anaphylaxis and syncope occurred following laiv, although rarely. These data provide reassurance regarding continued laiv use.",29148124

We evaluate whether the status of being overweight or obese is associated with increase in the development of hepatotoxicity and acute liver injury (ali) in patients with acute acetaminophen overdose. This was a retrospective cohort study comparing the risk of hepatotoxicity and ali between overweight or obese patients (body mass index [bmi] ≥ 25) and normal bmi patients (bmi ≤ 24.9) presenting with acute acetaminophen overdose at siriraj hospital during january 2004 to june 2012. All patients were treated with intravenous n-acetylcysteine. Psi parameters were calculated. High psi was defined as psi of ≥5.0 mm-hour. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regressions, odds ratio (or), stratified or, and 95% confidence interval (ci). There were 197 patients who fulfilled the criteria for analysis, 35 (17.8%) were obese, 24 (12.2%) were overweight, and 138 (70%) were normal bmi cases. Hepatotoxicity and ali developed in 25 (12.7%) and 40 (20.3%) cases, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that the overweight-obesity status and log  (psi value) were significant risk factors of ali, with or (95% ci) of 2.68 (1.21-5.95) and 1.74 (1.27-2.38), respectively, while only log  (psi) was a significant risk factor of hepatotoxicity with or (95% ci) 378.51 (39.49-3627.99). From stratification, overweight-obesity had significant odds ratios for ali in strata with low acetaminophen concentration, early initiation of n-acetylcysteine and low psi. We conclude that being overweight or obese is an independent risk factor of ali in acute acetaminophen overdoses.",29148111

To increase pediatric prescribing information, the pediatric research equity act (prea) was passed in 2003, requiring new drug applications to include pediatric assessments. We evaluated the study of new drugs in children since prea was implemented. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of new drug applications submitted to the fda from december 2003 to july 2012, using publicly available documents at drugs@fda. We calculated the proportion of new drugs that included a pediatric assessment at the time of approval and at a final review performed in july 2016. We identified 92 new drugs requiring pediatric assessments. Only 20 (21.7%) had been fully studied in children at the time of approval, while 9 (9.8%) had been partially assessed, and 63 (68.5%) did not have pediatric data. Among drugs approved without pediatric assessments, 4.2% met fda deferral deadlines and 34.9% eventually submitted pediatric data. At the time of our final review, allowing for a mean of 8.6 years since drug approval, 57.6% of new drugs had not been fully assessed in children. The mean time between approval in adults and availability of pediatric data for drugs approved without pediatric assessments was 6.5 years. These results represent a comprehensive evaluation of the study of new drugs in children and demonstrate that many drugs continue to be approved without pediatric data.

An algorithm based on a negative binomial time-series regression model run on 6 sequential observations prior to the monitored period was developed to forecast monthly counts of reports. A heuristic model to capture increases in counts when the previous 4 observations were null supplemented the regression. Count data were determined at drug-event combination. Sensitivity analyses were run to determine the effect of different methods of pooling or stratifying count data. Positive retrospective detections and positive predictive values (ppvs) were determined. The algorithm detected 8 of the 13 historical concerns, including all concerns of quality defects. The highest ppv (1.29%) resulted from increasing the lower count threshold from 3 to 5 and including literature reports in the counts. Both the regression model and the heuristic model components to the algorithm contributed to the detection of concerns. Sensitivity analysis indicates that stratification by commercial product reduces the ppv but suggests that pooling counts of related events may improve it. The results are encouraging and suggest that the algorithm could be useful for the detection of concerns that manifest as changes in frequency of reporting; however, further testing, including in prospective use, is warranted.",29143393

Using the danish nationwide health registries, we identified new users of edoxaban (n = 609) from june 6 (day of marketing) through june 2017. For comparison, we also identified new users of dabigatran (n = 2211), rivaroxaban (n = 19 227), and apixaban (n = 14 736). Users were described regarding indication of use, previous anticoagulant experience, comorbidity, and co-medication. The rate of edoxaban initiation increased to 2.0 per 100 000 person months in june 2017, compared with 6.3, 37.5, and 27.0 for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Atrial fibrillation was the most common registered indication for edoxaban (67%) as well as the other doacs (41-55%). Overall, users of edoxaban were comparable to users of other doacs (median age 75 vs 72-76 years and 57% vs 53-59% males), except for a generally lower concomitant use of other drugs. Noticeably, 95% of edoxaban users had previously received anticoagulant treatment compared with 31% to 43% for new users of other doacs, with 77% switching directly from another anticoagulant treatment to edoxaban (45% directly from vka and 32% directly from doacs). While the use of edoxaban is still limited compared with other doacs, it is increasing. The majority of edoxaban users switch to edoxaban from other anticoagulant treatments. Continued monitoring of the utilization of doacs, including effectiveness and safety, is considered essential to the safe and rational use of these drugs.",29141274

We categorised children into three mutually exclusive exposure groups according to maternal redemption of an antidepressant prescription from 2 years before pregnancy until delivery of the index child: unexposed (n = 863 033), prior user (use before but not during pregnancy) (n = 30 607), and use during pregnancy (n = 21 488). The children were followed from birth until first diagnosis of cancer, death, emigration, or december 31, 2012, whichever came first. The children were followed maximum 14.9 years and contributed to 6.9 × 10  person-years at risk. We estimated hazard ratios (hrs) of cancer using cox regression with 95% confidence intervals (cis). In total, 1298 (0.1%) children were diagnosed with cancer. Antidepressant use during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of childhood cancer in general; the hr was 1.03 (95% ci, 0.63-1.68), compared to children born by mothers who discontinued antidepressant use prior to pregnancy. The association between in utero exposure to antidepressants and childhood cancer did not depend on type or duration of antidepressant use.

Laboratory tests are a potential source of data for this purpose. We have examined the performance of the comparison on extreme laboratory tests (cert) algorithm, developed by ajou university, korea, as a potential tool for adverse drug reaction detection based on the electronic medical records of the singapore health care system. We implemented the original cert algorithm, comparing extreme laboratory results pre- and post-drug exposure, and 5 variations thereof using 4.5 years of national university hospital (nuh) electronic medical record data (31 869 588 laboratory tests, 6 699 591 drug dispensings from 272 328 hospitalizations). We investigated 6 drugs from the original cert paper and an additional 47 drugs. We benchmarked results against a reference standard that we created from uptodate 2015. The original cert algorithm applied to all 53 drugs and 44 laboratory abnormalities yielded a positive predictive value (ppv) and sensitivity of 50.3% and 54.1%, respectively. By raising the minimum number of cases for each drug-laboratory abnormality pair from 2 to 400, the ppv and sensitivity increased to 53.9% and 67.2%, respectively. This post hoc variation, named cert400, performed particularly well for drug-induced hepatic and renal toxicities. We have demonstrated that the cert algorithm can be applied across national boundaries. One modification (cert400) was able to identify adverse drug reaction signals from laboratory data with reasonable ppv and sensitivity, which indicates potential utility as a supplementary pharmacovigilance tool.",29108136

We performed a retrospective cohort study of apparently new users of monotherapy with metformin, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, nateglinide, or repaglinide within a dataset of medicaid beneficiaries from california, florida, new york, ohio, and pennsylvania. We did not include users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. We identified serious hypoglycemia outcomes within 180 days following new use using a validated, diagnosis-based algorithm. We calculated age- and sex-standardized outcome occurrence rates for each drug and generated propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios vs metformin using cox proportional hazards regression. The ranking of standardized occurrence rates of serious hypoglycemia was glyburide > glimepiride > glipizide > repaglinide > nateglinide > rosiglitazone > pioglitazone > metformin. Rates were increased for all study drugs at higher average daily doses. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) vs metformin were 3.95 (3.66-4.26) for glyburide, 3.28 (2.98-3.62) for glimepiride, 2.57 (2.38-2.78) for glipizide, 2.03 (1.64-2.52) for repaglinide, 1.21 (0.89-1.66) for nateglinide, 0.90 (0.75-1.07) for rosiglitazone, and 0.80 (0.68-0.93) for pioglitazone. Sulfonylureas were associated with the highest rates of serious hypoglycemia. Among all study drugs, the highest rate was seen with glyburide. Pioglitazone was associated with a lower adjusted hazard for serious hypoglycemia vs metformin, while rosiglitazone and nateglinide had hazards similar to that of metformin.",29108130

We compared rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage among initiators of extended-release niacin and initiators of fenofibrate. We used mini-sentinel (now sentinel) to conduct an observational, new user cohort analysis. We included data from 5 data partners covering the period from january 1, 2007 to august 31, 2013. Individuals who initiated extended-release niacin were propensity score-matched to individuals who initiated fenofibrate. Within the matched cohorts, we used cox proportional hazards models to compare rates of hospitalization for major gastrointestinal bleeding events and intracranial hemorrhage assessed using validated claims-based algorithms. A total of 234 242 eligible extended-release niacin initiators were identified, of whom 210 389 (90%) were 1:1 propensity score-matched to eligible fenofibrate initiators.

Mdd is believed to increase medication adherence, but studies are based on self-reported data, and results may depend on socially desirable answers. Therefore, our purpose was to determine the effect of mdd on medication adherence in non-adherent patients taking vitamin k antagonists (vkas), and to compare with instructing patients on medication use. We conducted a before-after study in non-adherent patients where mdd was the exposure and change in adherence after mdd initiation was the outcome (within patient comparison). Time in therapeutic range (ttr) was selected as a measure for adherence, as this reflects stability of vka treatment. To analyze whether mdd improved adherence as compared with standard care (ie, letters or calls from nurses of the anticoagulation clinic), non-adherent patients without mdd were also followed to estimate their ttr change over time (between patient comparison). Eighty-three non-adherent vka patients started using mdd. The median ttr was 63% before mdd and 73% 6 months after mdd. The within patient ttr increased on average by 13% (95%ci 6% to 21%) within 1 month after starting mdd and remained stable during the next 5 months. The ttr of mdd-patients increased 10% (95%ci 2% to 19%) higher as compared with non-mdd patients within 1 month but was similar after 4 months (ttr difference 3%, 95%ci -2% to 9%).

We used a 10% sample of australian pharmaceutical benefits scheme dispensing data (2005-2015) to identify individuals initiating amlodipine and atorvastatin as an fdc (n = 3996) or free combination (n = 5434), with or without prior statin dispensing. We measured the proportion of days covered in each 30-day period over 24 months and classified patterns of statin adherence using group-based trajectory models. We identified predictors of adherence trajectories using logistic regression. The median age was 71 years, and 53% were female. We identified 4 patterns of statin adherence: near-perfect adherence (n = 5383), good adherence (n = 1893), declining adherence (n = 1247), and early nonadherence (n = 907). Compared with the free combination, fdc initiators were more likely to have near-perfect adherence if they were previously statin adherent irrespective of amlodipine dose (amlodipine 5 mg: or = 1.61, 95% ci 1.38-1.87; amlodipine 10 mg: or = 2.39, 95% ci 1.63-3.51) or they were previously statin nonadherent and initiated on the 5 mg amlodipine dose (or = 1.87, 95% ci 1.50-2.32). Statin-naïve individuals initiating on the fdc with 10 mg amlodipine were less likely to have near-perfect adherence (or = 0.60, 95% ci 0.41-0.88) and more likely to have early nonadherence (or = 1.73, 95% ci 1.17-2.55). The amlodipine/atorvastatin fdc was associated with greater statin adherence among prevalent statin users, and individuals who initiated on lower amlodipine doses. The fdcs did not improve adherence in statin-naïve individuals and in some cases resulted in poorer adherence.",29067759

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the extent to which pharmaceutical claims from australia's national medicines subsidy programs (pharmaceutical benefits scheme [pbs] and repatriation schedule of pharmaceutical benefits [rpbs]) under-estimate prescription-only and total national opioid utilisation across time and for different opioids. A secondary aim was to examine the impact of the 2012 policy change to record all pbs/rpbs dispensed medicines, irrespective of government subsidy, on the degree of under-estimation. Aggregated data on australian opioid utilisation were obtained for the 2010 to 2014 calendar years, including all single ingredient and combination opioid analgesic preparations available on prescription or over-the-counter (otc). Total opioid utilisation (oral morphine equivalent kilogrammes) was quantified using sales data from ims health and compared with pharmaceutical claims data from the pbs/rpbs. Pbs/rpbs claims data did not account for 12.4% of prescription-only opioid utilisation in 2014 and 19.1% in 2010, and 18.4% to 25.4% of total opioid use when accounting for otc preparations. Between 2010 and 2014, 5.6% to 5.3% of buprenorphine, 8.1% to 6.3% fentanyl, 17.7% to 10.7% oxycodone, 18.4% to 11.0% tramadol, 38.4% to 21.0% hydromorphone, and 28.6% to 21.0% of prescription-only codeine utilisation were not accounted for in pbs/rpbs claims. Despite increased capture of less expensive (under co-payment) opioid items since 2012, pbs/rpbs claims still under-estimate opioid use in australia, with varying degrees across opioids. The estimates generated in this study allow us to better understand the degree of under-estimation and account for these in research using australia's national pharmaceutical claims data.",29047196

However, in daily practice, to treat patients adequately, there is a medical need for drugs that do not hold ma. To meet this medical need, medicinal products are used in clinical care without ma (unlicensed), such as products prepared by (local) pharmacies: the pharmaceutical preparations. Three types of pharmaceutical preparations are distinguished: (i) reconstitution in excess of summary of product characteristics; (ii) adaptation of a licensed medicinal product (outside its official labeling); (iii) medicinal products from an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Although unlicensed, patients may expect the same quality for these unlicensed pharmaceutical preparations as for the licensed medicinal products. To assure this quality, a proper risk-benefit assessment and proper documentation in (centralized) patient registries and linking to a national pharmacovigilance database should be in place. Based on a risk assessment matrix, requirements for quality assurance can be determined, which has impact on the level of documentation of a pharmaceutical preparation. In this paper, the approach for good documentation including quality assurance and benefit-risk assessment will be discussed and possibilities for patient registries are described to make these crucial preparations available for regular patient care. Key points ensuring pharmaceutical quality and performing a proper benefit-risk assessment will guarantee safe use of pharmaceutical preparations. Good documentation of (ultra-)orphan treatments can be collected in centralized patient registries and should be combined with existing information in (inter)national databases and self-reflection of patients. Linking patient registries to a centralized database for adverse drug events is highly recommended as it increases safety control of the (ultra) orphan pharmaceutical preparations.",29047193

Data on bzd and z-drugs utilization (for all indications) for the period 2005 to 2013 were obtained from pharmaceutical companies that distribute bzds in israel. Prevalence of bzd utilization was reported as defined daily doses (ddd)/1000 inhabitants/day. The utilization of bzds and z-drugs aimed to treat sleeping disorders increased over the period of the study from 10.22 to 22.49 ddd/1000 inhabitants/day. The greatest increases in utilization of drugs established in israel were observed for brotizolam (83%), zopiclone (59%), and zolpidem (94%). Decreases in use were recorded for lorazepam (14%), diazepam (16%), and oxazepam (27%). Use of hypnotic bzds appeared to be relatively high, compared with the use of non-bzd hypnotics (""z-drugs"") such as zolpidem or zopiclone. Nationwide stressful conditions did not appear to be reflected in the annual bzd sales. Conventional bzds and z-drugs remained the treatment of choice for sleeping disorders in israel during the study period. These results are, in certain cases, in contrast to current practice recommendations and guidelines and point at a need in better dissemination of these guidelines among prescribers in israel.",29027336

This article illustrates these challenges using a post-authorization safety study (pass) to assess adverse events (aes) experienced with fentanyl buccal tablet (fbt) over 3 months of treatment. This was an observational, prospective, multicenter study in france conducted over 1 year. The study employed primary data collection in fbt-treated patients and their treating physicians via a site qualification questionnaire and patient log completed by physicians and a questionnaire and pain diary completed by patients. Strategies to increase participation included reminders, newsletters, frequent follow-up telephone calls, and reducing the extent of data collected. Of the 1118 physicians contacted who returned the participation form or responded to a telephone call, only 128 expressed willingness to participate. Key reasons for non-participation were lack of interest (69.7%) and fbt not being used in practice by the contacted physician (25.1%). Overall, 224 patients were screened by 31 physicians, and 97 were enrolled. Key reasons for patient non-inclusion were unwillingness or inability to complete the patient ae diary or questionnaire (40.9% [52/127]) and patients' decision (33.9% [43/127]). Despite efforts to increase participation, enrollment in this study was low. Recruitment and retention methods are limited in their capacity to optimally execute a primary data collection in a pass. For a pass to provide reliable and valid information on medication use, involvement from health care agencies, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies is needed to establish their importance, drive study participation, and reduce patient withdrawal.",29027301

People aged 65 years or more acutely hospitalized in those internal medicine and geriatric wards that did continuously participate to the registro politerapie società italiana di medicina interna register from 2010 to 2016 were selected. Drugs use were categorized as 0 to 1 drug (very low drug use), 2 to 4 drugs (low drug use), 5 to 9 drugs (polypharmacy), and 10 or more drugs (excessive polypharmacy). To assess whether or not prevalence of patients in relation to drug use distribution changed overtime, adjusted prevalence ratios (prs) was estimated with log-binomial regression models. Among 2120 patients recruited in 27 wards continuously participating to data collection, 1882 were discharged alive and included in this analysis. The proportion of patients with very low drug use (0-1 drug) at hospital discharge increased overtime, from 2.7% in 2010 to 9.2% in 2016. Results from a log-logistic adjusted model confirmed the increasing pr of these very low drug users overtime (particularly in 2014 vs 2012, pr 1.83 95% ci 1.14-2.95). Moreover, from 2010 to 2016, there was an increasing number of patients who, on polypharmacy at hospital admission, abandoned it at hospital discharge, switching to the very low drug use group. This study shows that in internal medicine and geriatric wards continuously participating to the registro politerapie società italiana di medicina interna register, the proportion of patients with a very low drug use at hospital discharge increased overtime, thus reducing the therapeutic burden in this at risk population.",29027300

We show that in a model that includes terms for both ever-exposure versus never-exposure and cumulative exposure, the parameter for ever-exposure represents the effect of time-invariant allocation bias, and the parameter for cumulative exposure represents the effect of the drug after adjustment for this unmeasured confounding. This assumes no stepwise effect of the drug on the event rate, no reverse causation, and no unmeasured time-varying confounders. We demonstrated this by modelling the effect of statins on cardiovascular disease, for which the true effect has been well characterised in randomised trials, using time-updated cox regression models in a national cohort of type 2 diabetes patients. The crude hazard ratio associated with ever-use of statins was 1.13 in a standard cohort analysis comparing exposed with unexposed person-time intervals. When ever-never use and cumulative exposure are modelled jointly, the effect of statins can be estimated from the cumulative exposure parameter (hazard ratio 0.97 per year of exposure, 95% ci 0.97 to 0.98). The ever-exposed term (hazard ratio 1.20, 1.16 to 1.23) in this model can be interpreted as estimating the allocation bias. Where stepwise effects on the risk of adverse events are unlikely, as for instance for effects on risk of cancer, joint modelling of ever-never and cumulative exposure can be used to study the effects of multiple drugs and to distinguish causal effects from confounding by allocation.",29024286

However, there is an underlying continuous probability of exposure, and by insisting on a dichotomy, researchers unwillingly force a nondifferential misclassification into their analyses. We have recently developed a model whereby probability of exposure can be modeled, and we tested this on an empirical case of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid)-induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ugib). We used a case-controls data set, consisting of 3568 cases of severe ugib and 35 552 matched controls. Exposure to nsaid was based on 3 different conventional dichotomous measures. In addition, we tested 3 probabilistic exposure measures, a simple univariate backward-recurrence model, a ""full"" multivariable model, and a ""reduced"" multivariable model. Odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals for the association between nsaid use and ugib were calculated by conditional logistic regression, while adjusting for preselected confounders. Compared to the conventional dichotomous exposure measures, the probabilistic exposure measures generated adjusted ors in the upper range (4.37-4.75) while at the same time having the most narrow confidence intervals (ratio between upper and lower confidence limit, 1.46-1.50). Some ors generated by conventional measures were higher than the probabilistic ors, but only when the assumed period of intake was unrealistically short. The pattern of high ors and narrow confidence intervals in probabilistic exposure measures is compatible with less nondifferential misclassification of exposure than in a dichotomous exposure model. Probabilistic exposure measures appear to be an attractive alternative to conventional exposure measures.",29024218

This population-based cohort study used the computerized databases of the canadian province of quebec's health insurance. Patients with a first nvaf diagnosis from 2011 until 2014 were included. A logistic regression model yielded adjusted odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for predictors of treatment initiation with noacs versus vkas. Cox proportional hazards models yielded adjusted hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% cis for predictors of switching from vkas to noacs versus remaining on vkas, and for predictors of discontinuation of anticoagulation treatment. Of the 62 867 newly diagnosed nvaf patients, 14 646 initiated noacs and 17 685 vkas.

We conducted a series of monte carlo simulations on virtual observational studies. After estimating the propensity scores by logistic regression, we performed 1:1 optimal, nearest-neighbor, and caliper matching. We used 4 estimators on each matched sample: (1) a crude estimator without double-adjustment, (2) double-adjustment for the propensity scores, (3) double-adjustment for the unweighted unbalanced covariates, and (4) double-adjustment for the unbalanced covariates, weighted by their strength of association with the outcome. The crude estimator led to highest bias in all tested scenarios. Double-adjustment for the propensity scores effectively removed confounding only when the propensity score models were correctly specified. Double-adjustment for the unbalanced covariates was more robust to misspecification. Double-adjustment for the weighted unbalanced covariates outperformed the other approaches in every scenario and using any matching algorithm, as measured by the mean squared error. Double-adjustment can be used to remove residual confounding after propensity score matching. The unbalanced covariates with the strongest confounding effects should be adjusted.",28984050

There are numerous ways that propensity score (ps) matching can be implemented for subgroup analyses. We conducted a systematic literature review of methods papers that compared the performance of alternative methods to implement ps matched subgroup analyses and examined how frequently different ps matching methods have been used for subgroup analyses in applied studies. We identified 5 methods papers reporting small improvements in covariate balance and bias with use of a subgroup-specific ps instead of a mis-specified overall ps within subgroups. Applied research papers frequently used ps for subgroups in ways not evaluated in methods papers. Thirty three percent used ps to match in the overall cohort and broke the matched sets for subgroup analysis without further adjustment. While the performance of several alternative ways to use ps matching in subgroup analyses has been evaluated in methods literature, these evaluations do not include the most commonly used methods to implement ps matched subgroup analyses in applied studies.

For all new drugs, which were approved in the european union between 2007 and 2010, we reviewed the frequency, the type, and the reason for requiring a registry. The european public assessment reports, published on the website of the european medicine agency, were reviewed for drugs approved by the committee for medicinal products for human use. We searched for key characteristics of these drugs, including therapeutic area (atc1 level), level of innovation (the score is an algorithm based on availability of treatment and therapeutic effect), and procedural characteristics. In addition, we identified if these registries were defined by disease (disease registry) or exposure to a single drug (drug registry). Out of 116 new drugs approved in the predefined period, for 43 (37%), 1 to 6 registry studies were identified, with a total of 73 registries. Of these 46 were disease registries and 27 (single) drug registries. For 9 drugs, the registry was a specific obligation imposed by the regulators.

This cross-sectional study used individual patient data, the clinical practice research datalink from 1993 to 2015, to calculate monthly defined daily dose (ddd)/1000 registrants, monthly prevalence and incidence of tramadol users, annual supply days, and mean daily dose of tramadol. Aggregated-level national statistics and reimbursement data from 2004 to 2015 were also used to quantify annual and monthly tramadol ddd/1000 inhabitants and rate of tramadol-related deaths in england and wales. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to evaluate the impact of tramadol classification in june 2014. Prevalence of tramadol users increased from 23 to 97.6/10 000 registrants from 2000 to 2015.

Level and trend of monthly utilisation (β  : -12.9, β  : -1.6) and prevalence of tramadol users (β  : -6.4, β  : -0.37) significantly reduced after classification. Both annual tramadol utilisation and rate of tramadol-related deaths increased before tramadol classification and decreased thereafter. Increasing tramadol utilisation was influenced by the increase in prevalence and incidence of tramadol users, mean daily dose, and day of supply. Prevalence of tramadol users, tramadol utilisation, and reported deaths declined after tramadol classification.

Participants completed a drug-use diary and provided saliva samples to the research team to combine with ehr data. Of 252 practices contacted to participate, 66 (26%) mailed invitations to patients. Of the 3974 potentially eligible patients, 859 (22%) were at participating practices, and 526 (13%) were sent invitations. Of those invited, 117 (22%) consented to participate of whom 86 (74%) completed the study. We have confirmed the feasibility of supplementing ehr with data collected directly from patients. Although the present study successfully collected essential data from patients, it also underlined the requirement for improved engagement with both patients and general practitioners to support similar studies.",28924986

Peer review by ispor/ispe members and task force participants provided a consensus-building iterative process for the topics and framing of recommendations. The ispor/ispe task force recommendations cover seven topics such as study registration, replicability, and stakeholder involvement in rwe studies. These recommendations, in concert with earlier recommendations about study methodology, provide a trustworthy foundation for the expanded use of rwe in health care decision making.

This paper describes research priorities for pdmps that were initially discussed at a 2015 meeting of pdmp administrators, researchers, public health officials, and other stakeholders. Meeting participants defined the current landscape of pdmp research and identified research gaps. Research priorities were grouped by theme. Prescription drug monitoring program research priorities were identified for 3 key areas: individual patient health outcomes, prescriber use and decision making, and population-level outcomes. Research areas for individual patient outcomes include examining drug-use thresholds that best predict risk for overdose or substance use disorder and unintended consequences of pdmp use. Proposed research on prescriber pdmp use include evaluating how enhancements to the content and format of pdmp reports informs clinical decision making and optimal clinician actions in response to a concerning pdmp report. Finally, research topics related to population-level outcomes include measuring the impact of pdmp policies on the incidence of substance misuse and harms and assessing the return on investment for these databases. The clinical, public health, and economic impacts of pdmps must be evaluated, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. In addition to assessing patient outcomes, qualitative research should examine how clinicians use and interpret pdmp information. Research should also examine the impact of pdmp features and policies on prescriber utilization. Comparative analyses across states with differing pdmp policies should be conducted to inform best practices.",28905438

Whether this is associated with increased chronic pain prevalence in the australian population is unknown. This study aimed to estimate (1) the prevalence of chronic pain and analgesia use in the australian population by age and sex; (2) the severity of pain in the population with chronic pain by sex; and (3) the distribution of recent pain severity in those using analgesia by age and sex. This study used cross-sectional, nationally representative data collected by the australian bureau of statistics 2011 to 2012 national health survey. A total of n = 20 426 participants were included with an overall response rate of 84.8%. Weighting procedures were applied to obtain population estimates, confidence intervals, and when testing for statistical significance. The prevalence of chronic and reoccurring pain (over a 6-month period) was 15.4% (2.75 million) for australians aged ≥15 years. Prevalence increased with age for both sexes. Significantly more females reported moderate-to-very severe pain overall (p < 0.001), and within most age groups. Recent use of opioid analgesia was reported by 12.0% of males and 13.4% of females with chronic pain. Chronic pain and opioid analgesic use are important public health issues in australia. Study estimates of chronic pain and recent pain were no greater than earlier estimates. The acknowledged increase of opioid use in the literature thus appears consistent with changing treatment and/or prescribing patterns over time. Sex differences regarding pain prevalence, severity, and opioid use were apparent.",28895247

Data were from 47 356 adult participants of national health and nutrition survey from 1999-2000 to 2013-2014. Participants were asked about prescription medications used in the past 30 days. Long-term use of prescription opioids was defined by use for 90 days or longer. The prevalence of prescription opioid use increased from 4.1% of us adults in 1999-2000 to 6.8% in 2013-2014 (odds ratio [or] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.10-1.75, p = .007). This trend was driven by a sharp increase in long-term use which increased from 1.8% to 5.4% (or = 2.22, 95% ci = 1.65-3.00, p < .001). Of all opioid users in 2013-2014, 79.4% were long-term users compared with 45.1% in 1999-2000. Long-term use was associated with poorer physical health, concurrent benzodiazepine use, and history of heroin use. The findings highlight the need for research on potential benefits and harms of long-term use of opioids and efforts to restrict long-term use to patients for whom the benefits outweigh the risks.",28879660

A comprehensive search was conducted on pubmed, embase, and the cochrane library. Pooled relative risk (rr) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated using the random effects model. Bisphosphonate use was associated with a 16% lower breast cancer risk (pool rr0.84, 95%ci 0.77-0.90, n = 8). A protective effect of bisphosphonate was found in cohort studies (rr 0.85, 95%ci 0.80-0.90, n = 4) and case-control studies (rr 0.78, 95%ci 0.64-0.96, n = 4).we also found that the use of bisphosphonate resulted in a statistically significant reduction in all breast cancer risk (rr 0.87, 95%ci 0.81-0.93) and greater reduction in invasive breast cancer risk (rr 0.78, 95%ci 0.68-0.91) and contralateral breast cancer risk (rr, 0.41; 95% ci, 0.20-0.84).with respect to the type of bisphosphonate, we found that alendronate and etidronate resulted significant reduction in breast cancer risk. The short-term use of bisphosphonate (<1 y) led to nonsignificant change (rr 0.93, 95%ci 0.86-1.00), but a significant 26% reduction of breast cancer risk was noted with long-term use (>1 y) (rr 0.74, 95%ci 0.66-0.83). Our results supported bisphosphonate as being effective in preventing breast cancer, including invasive and contralateral breast cancer.

With growing momentum for earlier drug approvals and reliance on real-world evidence, we studied if the black triangle label promotes more judicious prescribing. We examined whether general practitioners prescribed escitalopram, tadalafil, and vardenafil with a black triangle more cautiously than the same or similar drugs without a black triangle in the health improvement network (uk). We performed interrupted time-series analyses to estimate changes in new prescription rates and nested case-control studies to compare characteristics of new users before and after removal of a black triangle. Prescribing rates to the 33 441 new users of these new drugs were highest shortly after initial approval and declined subsequently; there were no increases in rates of new prescriptions after a black triangle's removal (new prescriptions/million/month postlabel: escitalopram -1.5 [95% ci, -1.9 to -1.2]; tadalafil and vardenafil: -0.1 [95% ci, -0.6 to 0.4]). Among drugs in the same class, loss of a patent had more impact on prescribing rates than loss of a black triangle. People who began taking black triangle drugs were less likely to be young or to have multiple comorbidities or recent hospitalization compared with those starting the same drugs after the label's removal. However, these differences generally reflected secular trends seen also in similar, unlabeled medicines. Accelerated drug approvals could cause more uncertainty about drug effectiveness and safety, but specific labeling of newly approved medicines is unlikely to promote more judicious prescribing.",28857309

It shares many common possible pathogenic mechanisms with cardiovascular diseases. Many studies have discussed the association between amd and stroke, but the results were inconsistent. Our aim was to determine the associations between neovascular amd and the risk of stroke in the taiwanese population. This is a retrospective cohort study. We used claims data from national health insurance research database. Patients aged more than 45 years without stroke, myocardial infarction, or any amd were selected from 2001 to 2008 and followed until 2010. The index date was defined as the date of namd diagnosis (icd-9 code, 362.52). The comparison group was patients without an namd diagnosis with age- and sex-matched to namd subjects at a ratio of up to 10 to 1. Kaplan-meier survival analysis and cox regression analysis were used. The incidence of stroke events (icd-9 codes, 430-434) and their subtypes (hemorrhagic and ischemic) were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included acute myocardial infarction (ami), composite ami/stroke, and all-cause mortality. Patients with namd had a higher risk of developing stroke, with an adjusted hr of 1.30 (95% ci, 1.01-1.68). A higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke (hr, 1.70, 95% ci, 1.03-2.83) was also found. No significant differences were observed in ischemic stroke, the composite of ami/stroke, and all-cause mortality. Patients with namd had a significantly higher risk of developing stroke, which was driven mainly by the increased risk of developing the hemorrhagic subtype.",28856767

We aimed to determine whether medications dispensed in days divisible by 7 are more likely to be blister packed than medications dispensed in other quantities. Community pharmacies in manitoba were invited to participate in a mail-out survey to identify the use of blister packaging for up to 25 patients who had a solid oral medication dispensed from april 1, 2012 to march 31, 2014. Eligible medications were identified using the population-based province-wide retail pharmacy network. Algorithms for identifying the use of blister packaging were determined by comparing the proportion of fills that confirmed blister pack use between different days supply quantities. Twenty-seven out of 32 pharmacies that agreed to participate completed the survey. The total number of prescriptions in the analysis was 2045 of which 131 (6.4%) were dispensed in blister packaging. Overall, prescriptions dispensed in days divisible by 7 yielded a 72.5% sensitivity, 86.6% specificity, 30.3% ppv, and 97.9% npv compared with prescriptions dispensed in other quantities. A 28-day to 30-day comparison yielded an 87.9% sensitivity, 96.1% specificity, 64.6% ppv, and 99.0% npv. While the npv was high, the ppv for identifying blister packaging using the days supply field in pharmacy claims data was modest given the low prevalence in blister pack use. The best predictor occurred when 28 days was compared with 30 days. Key points blister packs are arranged in 4 × 7 compartments and are often used to improve adherence, but no studies have examined whether it was possible to identify the use of blister packs using the days supply field in pharmacy claims data. Findings show that a 28-day supply yielded a high sensitivity and specificity for identifying the use of blister packaging compared with a 30-day supply, but there is potential for misclassification. Future studies directed at examining subgroups that are more likely to use blister packs and replication of findings using other data sources in other jurisdictions are encouraged.",28856756

This is the first study examining the prevalence and the risks of off-label antidepressant prescriptions in minors over time in germany and analyzing patterns regarding age, sex, drug class, and type of off-label use. We used claims data of about two million individuals (<18 y) to calculate the share of off-label antidepressant prescriptions for the years 2004 to 2011, stratified by age, sex, and drug class. Off-label prescriptions were analyzed regarding underlying diagnoses, the prescribing doctor's specialty, and the type of off-label use. Incidence rates of adverse events were calculated for off- and on-label use, and the risk of suicidal events associated with off- or on-label use was examined in a nested case-control study. The prevalence of off-label prescriptions decreased from 58.0% to 40.9%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were more frequently prescribed off-label than tricyclic antidepressants (37.7% vs 17.5% in 2011). The most common type of off-label use was off-label use by age, followed by off-label use by indication, and off-label use by contraindication. Adverse events were rare with no significant differences between on- and off-label use. Although off-label antidepressant use in minors decreased over time, it is still common. However, this rather indicates a lack of approved drugs for the treatment of depression in this population than inappropriate medical treatment. This is supported by the fact that off-label use was not associated with a higher risk of adverse events than on-label use.",28840629

We estimated cox proportional hazards models of all-cause mortality, with influenza vaccination as a time-varying exposure. We controlled for common demographics, comorbidities, and health care utilization variables and then added 20 adl dependency predictors. To gauge residual confounding, we estimated pre-influenza season hazard ratios (hrs) between september 1, 2007 and january 5, 2008, which should be 1.0 in the absence of bias. A cohort of 2 235 140 beneficiaries was created, with a median follow-up of 224 days. Overall, 52% were vaccinated and 4% died during follow-up. During the pre-influenza season period, controlling for demographics, comorbidities, and health care use resulted in a hr of 0.66 (0.64, 0.67). Adding the adl dependency predictors moved the hr to 0.68 (0.67, 0.70). Controlling for demographics and adl dependency predictors alone resulted in a hr of 0.68 (0.66, 0.70). Results were consistent with those in the literature, with significant uncontrolled confounding after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and health care use. Adding adl dependency predictors moved hrs slightly closer to the null. Of the comorbidities, health care use variables, and adl dependency predictors, the last set reduced confounding most.

Reformulation of these products with abuse-deterrent properties is one approach for addressing this problem. Fda has approved several extended-release opioid analgesics with abuse-deterrent labeling, the bases of which come from pre-market studies. As all opioid analgesics must be capable of delivering the opioid in order to reduce pain, abuse-deterrent properties do not prevent abuse, nor do pre-market evaluations ensure that there will be reduced abuse in the community. Utilizing data from various surveillance systems, some recent post-market studies suggest a decline in abuse of extended-release oxycodone after reformulation with abuse-deterrent properties. We discuss challenges stemming from the use of such data. We quantify the relationship between the sample, the population, and the underlying sampling mechanism and identify the necessary conditions if valid statements about the population are to be made. The presence of other interventions in the community necessitates the use of comparators. We discuss the principles under which the use of comparators can be meaningful. Results based on surveillance data need to be interpreted with caution as the underlying sampling mechanisms can bias the results in unpredictable ways. The use of comparators has the potential to disentangle the effect due to the abuse-deterrence properties from those due to other interventions. However, identifying a comparator that is meaningful can be very difficult.",28833803

We propose vigipoint, a method that contrasts the relative frequency of covariate values in a data subset of interest to those within one or more comparators, utilizing odds ratios with adaptive statistical shrinkage. Nested analyses identify higher order patterns, and permutation analysis is employed to protect against chance findings. For illustration, a total of 164 000 adverse event reports related to medication errors were characterized and contrasted to the other 7 833 000 reports in vigibase, the who global database of individual case safety reports, as of may 2013. The initial scope included 2000 features, such as patient age groups, reporter qualifications, and countries of origin. Vigipoint highlighted 109 key features of medication error reports. The most prominent were that the vast majority of medication error reports were from the united states (89% compared with 49% for other reports in vigibase); that the majority of reports were sent by consumers (53% vs 17% for other reports); that pharmacists (12% vs 5.3%) and lawyers (2.9% vs 1.5%) were overrepresented; and that there were more medication error reports than expected for patients aged 2-11 years (10% vs 5.7%), particularly in germany (16%).

Clinical variables including age, gender, medication use, health care utilization, and medical history were evaluated for correlations with opioid use. Forty percent of patients took opioid medications during a 12-month span, and the prevalence of any opioid use was highest for 20 to 29-year-old patients (58%). The median daily opioid dose was 1.85 mg (interquartile range: 0.62-10.68 mg) oral morphine equivalents (ome). While most opioid users took between 0 and 5 mg ome daily, 3% of pediatric patients and 23% of adult patients used more than 30-mg ome daily. High-dose opioid use was associated with older age, hydroxyurea therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) use, and frequent inpatient hospitalizations. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients with vaso-occlusive complications such as pain crisis (or = 3.8, 95% ci 2.7-5.3) and avascular necrosis (avn) (or = 3.7, 95% ci 2.7-5.1) were associated with high-dose opioid use. Our study showed that only 40% scd patients were on opioid analgesics during a 12-month span. However, a non-trivial number of patients used a much higher dose of opioids despite a relatively low average daily opioid dose among scd patients, particularly with vaso-occlusive complications.",28815799

The norwegian mother and child cohort, a prospective population-based study, and the medical birth registry of norway provided information on antidepressant exposure, depression, and anxiety symptoms in pregnancy, preeclampsia diagnoses, and important covariates. Within a pregnancy cohort of depressed women, we compared the risk of late-onset preeclampsia between ssri-exposed and nonmedicated pregnancies using marginal structural models (weighted) and modified poisson regression models. Of the 5887 pregnancies included, 11.1% were exposed at any time before week 34 to ssris, 1.3% to serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, 0.4% to tricyclic antidepressants, and 0.5% to other antidepressants. The risks of early- and late-onset preeclampsia by exposure status in pregnancy were 0.3% and 3.6% (nonmedicated), 0.4% and 3.7% (ssris), 1.5% and 4.1% (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), and 7.1% and 10.0% (tricyclic antidepressants). Compared with nonmedicated pregnancies, ssri-exposed in mid and late gestation had adjusted relative risks for late-onset mild preeclampsia of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-1.53) and 1.56 (0.71-3.44) (weighted models), respectively. There was no association between ssri exposure in pregnancy and severe late-onset preeclampsia. We have provided evidence that ssri use in early and midpregnancy does not substantially increase the risk of late-onset preeclampsia.",28815791

The setting for this study is the clinical practice research datalink (cprd), a uk general practice research database. For 16,034 diabetic patients identified in cprd, with at least 2 measures in a 30-month period, hba1c was estimated after temporarily omitting (i) the final and (ii) middle known values using linear interpolation, simple linear regression, arithmetic mean, random effects, and fpca. Performance of each method was assessed using mean prediction error. The influence on predictive accuracy of (1) more homogeneous populations and (2) number and range of known hba1c values was explored. When estimating the last observation, the predictive accuracy of fpca was highest with over half of predicted values within 0.4 units, equivalent to laboratory measurement error. Predictive accuracy improved when estimating the middle observation with almost 60% predicted values within 0.4 units for fpca. These results were marginally better than that achieved by simpler approaches, such as last-occurrence-carried-forward linear interpolation. This pattern persisted with more homogeneous populations as well as when variability in hba1c measures coupled with frequency of data points were considered. When estimating change from baseline to prespecified time points in electronic medical records data, a marginal benefit to using the more complex modelling approach of fpca exists over more traditional methods.",28812323

The aim of this study was to compare bias and efficiency of such a one-stage meta-analysis with a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we compared the approaches by generating matched case-control data under 5 simulated scenarios, built by varying: (1) the exposure-outcome association; (2) its variability among databases; (3) the confounding strength of one covariate on this association; (4) its variability; and (5) the (heterogeneous) confounding strength of two covariates. Second, we made the same comparison using empirical data from the aritmo project, a multiple database study investigating the risk of ventricular arrhythmia following the use of medications with arrhythmogenic potential. In our study, we specifically investigated the effect of current use of promethazine. Bias increased for one-stage meta-analysis with increasing (1) between-database variance of exposure effect and (2) heterogeneous confounding generated by two covariates. The efficiency of one-stage meta-analysis was slightly lower than that of two-stage meta-analysis for the majority of investigated scenarios. Based on aritmo data, there were no evident differences between one-stage (or = 1.50, ci = [1.08; 2.08]) and two-stage (or = 1.55, ci = [1.12; 2.16]) approaches. When the effect of interest is heterogeneous, a one-stage meta-analysis ignoring clustering gives biased estimates. Two-stage meta-analysis generates estimates at least as accurate and precise as one-stage meta-analysis.

Little data exist to understand the contribution of ir products to the problem of prescription opioid abuse. This study aimed to better understand abuse patterns for hydrocodone ir combination products among adult and adolescent substance abusers. This cross-sectional study examines abuse prevalence (including abuse adjusted for prescription volume and morphine milligram equivalents) and abuse characteristics for hydrocodone ir combination products and other prescription opioids among separate samples of adults and adolescents assessed for substance abuse problems or entering treatment from january 2012 through june 2015. Results indicate higher abuse for hydrocodone ir combination products than other opioid categories per 100 assessments but lower per prescriptions dispensed. Hydrocodone ir combination products had similar abuse prevalence to all extended-release and long-acting opioids when considering abuse measured per morphine milligram equivalents dispensed. An upward trend in hydrocodone ir combination product abuse was observed among adult substance abusers comparing the period prior to and after drug enforcement administration rescheduling of these products in october 2014. Most individuals reported oral abuse of hydrocodone ir combination products, but snorting, reported by 23% of hydrocodone ir combination product abusers, also appears to be a route of abuse that may have public health relevance. Given their high prescription volume, hydrocodone ir combination products, even at a relatively low prevalence of abuse, may contribute substantially to the overall problem of prescription opioid abuse. Additional public health interventions, including development of abuse-deterrent formulations for these types of opioid products may aid in reducing their abuse.",28771942

We investigated the effects of safety signals and regulation shifts concerning rosiglitazone on prescribing of antidiabetic drugs (ads). Patient data were extracted from the korean health insurance claims database for 2007 to 2015. Linear regression and interrupted time series analyses were performed to examine drug utilization trends and the impact of 5 milestone events regarding rosiglitazone safety on ad utilization. A steady growth was observed in the ad consumption, with metformin preserving its dominant market share throughout the period. Pioglitazone use has increased since 2008 in response to safety issues surrounding rosiglitazone. A significant decline in rosiglitazone use was observed after nissen's meta-analysis and safety warnings (2007) and after restriction/suspension of access to rosiglitazone (2010), associated with a drop in prevalence by 29.5%/year and 99.5%/year, respectively. The most common ad newly started among users who discontinued rosiglitazone in 2010 was pioglitazone, followed by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp-4) inhibitors. Our concomitancy analysis showed that dpp-4 inhibitors have overtaken sulfonylureas since 2014 as the most common add-on to metformin. The most frequently added ad in diabetes patients who had switched off rosiglitazone in 2010 was pioglitazone, followed by dpp-4 inhibitors. Despite new evidence from a long-term clinical trial and the food and drug administration's subsequent decision to eliminate access restrictions on rosiglitazone in 2013, domestic regulations were left intact; hence, its use remained negligible in korea.",28771933

This prospective observational cohort study compared pregnancy outcomes of 446 women exposed with metamizole in the first trimester with a randomly selected control cohort comprising 887 women not exposed to metamizole. Relevant data were obtained via structured questionnaires applied during the first trimester and 2 months after the expected date of birth between january 2000 and december 2015. The rate of major birth defects (7/373, 1.9%) was not increased in the metamizole cohort (or adjusted 1.15, 95% ci 0.4-3.5).

The us food and drug administration recognized these risks and approved the er/la opioid analgesic risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (er/la rems), which has a goal of reducing opioid misuse and abuse and their associated consequences. The primary objective of this analysis is to determine whether er/la rems implementation was associated with decreased reports of misuse and abuse. Data from the researched abuse, diversion and addiction-related surveillance (radars(r)) system poison center program were utilized. Poison center cases are assigned a reason for exposure, a medical outcome, and a level of health care received. Rates adjusted for population and drug utilization were analyzed over time. Radars system poison center program data indicate a notable decrease in er/la opioid rates of intentional abuse and misuse as well as major medical outcomes or hospitalizations following implementation of the er/la rems. While similar decreases were observed for the ir prescription opioid group, the decreasing rate for the er/la opioids exceeded the decreasing rates for the ir prescription opioids and was distinctly different than that for the prescription stimulants, indicating that the er/la rems program may have had an additional effect on decreases in opioid abuse and intentional misuse beyond secular trends.",28758289

Multivariable logistic regression estimated the odds ratios (ors) of having at least one algorithm-defined mcm in the etn-exposed cohorts versus unexposed comparators. Prevalence estimates for pregnancy outcomes were comparable across cia and pso cohorts. Algorithm-defined prevalence estimates of having at least one mcm were 6.1% (etn exposed), 5.5% (unexposed), and 5.7% (gp cohort) for the cia cohort; pso cohort estimates were 2.0%, 4.2%, and 4.7%, respectively.

Sirolimus is now the first-line drug for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Sirolimus-induced stomatitis is the most frequent adverse event experienced during treatment. To identify risk factors, we investigated the association of stomatitis incidence with patient background data and treatment parameters, using data from the multicenter long-term sirolimus trial. Subjects received sirolimus for 2 years at doses adjusted to maintain a trough blood level of 5 to 15 ng/ml. The incidence of stomatitis was correlated with baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and changes in the longitudinal data. Risk factors at baseline were assessed by using univariate and multivariate analyses. The most frequent adverse event was stomatitis, with the cumulative rate reaching 88.9% by 9 months, higher than that reported in postrenal transplant patients. The repetition, the duration, and the severity of stomatitis events were variable among patients. We found that patients with low hemoglobin (hb) (<14.5 g/dl) showed significantly higher incidence than those with high hb (≥14.5 g/dl, p < .01). The cumulative rate for stomatitis incidence was significantly associated with a decrease in the mean corpuscular volume, while the hb level was constant; thus, red blood cell count in patients increased during the study. Baseline hb levels and a decrease in mean corpuscular volume during treatment were correlated with the incidence of stomatitis.",28752672

Retrospective cohort study using linked administrative data. Patients included those with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (confirmed in hospital) who received a first prescription for a doac (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) from september 2011 to june 2014. Drug utilisation measures included discontinuation, persistence, and adherence. A total of 5398 patients (mean cha  ds  -vasc score 2.98 [sd 1.71], 89.7% with ≥5 concomitant medicines) were treated with doacs for a median of 228 days (interquartile range 105-425). Of 35.6% who discontinued doac treatment, 11.0% switched to warfarin, and 48.3% reinitiated doacs. Persistence after 12 and 18 months was 75.9% and 69.8%, respectively. Differences between individual doacs were observed: discontinuation rates ranged from 20.4% (apixaban) to 60.6% (dabigatran) and 12 months persistence from 60.1% (dabigatran) to 85.5% (apixaban). Adherence to treatment with all doacs was good: overall doac median medication refill adherence was 102.9% (interquartile range 88.9%-115.5%), and 82.3% of patients had a medication refill adherence > 80%. In scotland, adherence to doac treatment was good, and switching from doac to warfarin was low. However, discontinuation and persistence rates were variable-although treatment interruptions were often temporary. To decrease the inconsistencies in drug utilisation methods and facilitate meaningful study comparison, the use of a coherent framework-using a combination of discontinuation, persistence, and adherence-and the standardisation of measurements is advocated.",28752670

We extracted data of adult patients with t2dm from a medical claims database in japan, which included 1 million individuals. The study period was 2005-2013, before the era of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. The inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of t2dm who had at least 1 prescription for a glucose-lowering drug. We further examined the number of dka-related admissions and medication use prior to admission. Calculation of dka incidence was on a patient-years basis, with 95% confidence interval using a poisson distribution. Of 36,674 adult patients with t2dm, we identified 74 cases admitted for dka, with an estimated dka incidence of 0.48/1000 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.60/1000) patient-years. Of these 74 cases, approximately two-thirds of patients had no past or recent history of glucose-lowering drug use before admission for dka. This study estimated that the incidence of dka was 0.48/1000 patient-years in japan, similar to previous studies. We also found that underuse of glucose-lowering medication was common among patients hospitalized for dka. Key points the population-based incidence of dka in t2dm is largely unknown. In japan, the estimated dka incidence was 0.48/1000 (95% ci, 0.38-0.60/1000) patient-years.

We estimated 1-year dabigatran and rivaroxaban adherence rates in nv-af patients and assessed associations between baseline patient characteristics and nonadherence. This cohort study included oac-naive nv-af patients with no contraindications to oac, who initiated dabigatran and rivaroxaban, using nationwide data from french national health care databases. One-year adherence was defined by the proportion of days covered of 80% or more over a fixed 1-year period after treatment initiation. Associations between nonadherence and baseline patient characteristics were assessed using multivariate logistic regression models. The population was composed of 11 141 dabigatran (women: 48%; mean age: 74 ± 10.7 y; ≥80 y: 34.9%) and 11 126 rivaroxaban (46.5%; 74 ± 10.9 y; 34.8%) new users. One-year adherence was 53.3% in dabigatran-treated and 59.9% in rivaroxaban-treated patients, consistent with numerous subgroup analyses. A switch to vitamin k antagonist was observed in 14.5% of dabigatran and 11.7% of rivaroxaban patients; 10.2% and 5.9% of patients switched to another doac, respectively; and 4.3% of patients died in the 2 cohorts. In patients who did not die or switch during the follow-up, 1-year adherence was 69.6% in dabigatran-treated and 72.3% in rivaroxaban-treated patients. Having concomitant ischemic heart diseases was associated with an increased risk of nonadherence in the 2 cohorts. In this real-life study, 1-year adherence to doac is poor in nv-af new users. Despite the introduction of doac, adherence to oacs may remain a significant challenge in af patients.",28752560

Our objective was to develop an algorithm for identifying the nature and patterns of treatment lines in a cohort of newly treated multiple myeloma patients. A cohort of multiple myeloma patients starting a first treatment line was built using both ambulatory and hospital data from regional data of the french national healthcare system database (sniiram). Patients were identified from january 2011 to september 2013 using icd-10 codes for multiple myeloma ('c90') within long-term conditions or diagnosis from hospital data. Drugs of interest for cycle identification included bortezomib, imids (thalidomide, lenalidomide), alkylating drugs (cyclophosphamide, melphalan, bendamustine, doxorubicin) and dexamethasone. An algorithm was applied to define combinations of treatment received in the first 6 months of treatment. Among the 236 patients included, 45% received bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (vmp: n = 107), 22% bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (vtd/vtd-pace: n = 52) and 21% melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide (mpt: n = 49).

These studies are often not focused on pregnant women, or medical records were used as a data source where it is unclear if medications have been dispensed. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the concordance between self-reported medication data and pharmacy records among pregnant women and its determinants. We conducted a population-based cohort study within the generation r study, in 2637 pregnant women. The concordance between self-reported medication data and pharmacy records was calculated for different therapeutic classes using yule's y. We evaluated a number of variables as determinant of discordance between both sources through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The concordance between self-reports and pharmacy records was moderate to good for medications used for chronic conditions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or anti-asthmatic medications (0.88 and 0.68, respectively). Medications that are used occasionally, such as antibiotics, had a lower concordance (0.51). Women with a turkish or other non-western background were more likely to demonstrate discordance between pharmacy records and self-reported data compared with women with a dutch background (turkish: odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.29; other non-western: odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.71). Further research is needed to assess how the cultural or ethnic differences may affect the concordance or discordance between both medication sources. The results of this study showed that the use of multiple sources is needed to have a good estimation of the medication use during pregnancy.",28744981

We conducted a cohort study among 1747 hiv/hcv patients initiating nrti-containing art within the veterans aging cohort study (2002-2009) to determine if cumulative mtnrti use increased the risk of hepatic decompensation and death among hiv-/hcv-coinfected patients. Separate marginal structural models were used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) of each outcome associated with cumulative exposure to art regimens that contain mtnrtis versus regimens that contain other nrtis. Over 7033 person-years, we observed 97 (5.6%) decompensation events (incidence rate, 13.8/1000 person-years) and 125 (7.2%) deaths (incidence rate, 17.8 events/1000 person-years). The risk of hepatic decompensation increased with cumulative mtnrti use (1-11 mo: hr, 1.79 [95% confidence interval (ci), 0.74-4.31]; 12-35 mo: hr, 1.39 [95% ci, 0.68-2.87]; 36-71 mo: hr, 2.27 [95% ci, 0.92-5.60]; >71 mo: hr, 4.66 [95% ci, 1.04-20.83]; p = .045) versus nonuse.

The issues were characterized according to drug class, adverse event, years since drug approval, initiator of regulatory actions, revised section of pi, and evidence source. We also quantified the durations from signal detection to tentative decision and from tentative decision to regulatory action. We identified 144 serious safety issues during the study period, and the majority of evidence originated from spontaneous reports (83.5%). The pmda initiated regulatory actions for half of all safety issues, and the median duration from drug approval to regulatory action was 8 years (interquartile range [iqr], 3-26.5 years). The median duration was 49 days (iqr, 0-362 days) from signal detection to tentative decision and 84 days (iqr, 63-136 days) from tentative decision to regulatory action. Several safety issues involving older drugs and multiple products had protracted decision-making durations. Most safety issues led to prompt regulatory actions predominantly based on spontaneous reports. Some safety issues that were not easily detected by the spontaneous reporting system were identified years after approval. In addition, several safety issues required assessments of multiple drug products, which prolonged the decision-making process.",28722235

This paper presents a qualitative comparison of the 2 methods. We review and critically assess similarities and differences of sw and dce based on 6 aspects: comprehension by study participants, cognitive biases, sample representativeness, ability to capture heterogeneity in preferences, reliability and validity, and robustness of the results. The sw choice task can be more difficult, but the workshop context in which sw is conducted may provide more support to patients who are unfamiliar with the end points being evaluated or who have cognitive impairments. Both methods are similarly prone to a number of biases associated with preference elicitation, and dce is prone to simplifying heuristics, which limits its application with large number of attributes. The low cost per patient of the dce means that it can be better at achieving a representative sample, though sw does not require such large sample sizes due to exact nature of the collected preference data. This also means that internal validity is automatically enforced with sw, while the internal validity of dce results needs to be assessed manually. Choice between the 2 methods depends on characteristics of the benefit-risk assessment, especially on how difficult the trade-offs are for the patients to make and how many patients are available. Although there exist some empirical studies on many of the evaluation aspects, critical evidence gaps remain.",28696023

We searched the world health organization's consolidated list of [medicinal] products, drug regulatory authorities' websites, pubmed, google scholar, and selected textbooks to identify medicinal products withdrawn from 1950 to june 2016. We included medicinal products for which animal data were specifically reported as a reason for withdrawal. We used a checklist adapted from the international agency for research on cancer criteria to rate the evidence. In 37 cases, evidence from animals was the reason given for withdrawal between 1963 and 2000. Evidence of carcinogenicity was cited in 23 cases (62%). Limited evidence for harms occasioned withdrawal in over 80% of cases. In 11 cases (30%), the adverse drug reactions were subsequently reported in humans. In 5 instances (14%), formal studies were conducted in humans. The median interval to withdrawal following reports of adverse reactions was 2 years (iqr = 1-9 y).

Young patients tend to be unaware of their vrfs and to have lower medication adherence. We examined how age affects the prevalence of previously undiagnosed vrfs and the extent of medication nonadherence among stroke patients. Using taiwan's national health insurance research database, we identified consecutive adult patients with first-ever stroke between 2000 and 2013. Diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia was ascertained using validated methods. We investigated (1) the proportion of patients who had undiagnosed vrfs within 3 years before stroke and (2) the proportion of nonadherence to medications among patients who had a previously diagnosed vrf. Among stroke patients with hypertension (n = 9722), diabetes (n = 4751), and hyperlipidemia (n = 4486), 24.9%, 20.8%, and 55.0%, respectively, had not been diagnosed before stroke, whereas 56.0%, 66.7%, and 32.5%, respectively, had been diagnosed at least 1 year before stroke. The proportions of medication nonadherence were 71.5%, 64.3%, and 88.4% in patients with previously diagnosed hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, respectively. In multivariate analysis, younger age was independently associated with undiagnosed hypertension before stroke as well as medication nonadherence in patients with previously diagnosed hypertension or diabetes.

The aims of our study were to investigate prescribing trends of antipsychotic medication in the general population, children, and older patients by drug generation (first or second), the prescribing trend in pregnant women, the probable indication for antipsychotic prescription, and the prescribing trend by dosage form. This descriptive study identified and included all patients prescribed with antipsychotic in hong kong from 2004 to 2014 using the clinical data analysis and report system. This study calculated and reported the prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing in patient groups of interest, the percentage with diagnoses of mental disorders were derived, and the prevalence of antipsychotic by dosage forms. The study included 10 109 206 prescriptions of any antipsychotics to 256 903 patients. Over the study period, the prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing increased from 1.06% to 1.54% in the general population, from 0.10% to 0.23% in children (3-17 years old), and from 2.61% to 3.26% in older patients (≥65 years old). The prevalence of second-generation antipsychotics increased, but the prevalence of first-generation antipsychotics did not. Prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing in prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum timeframes varied from 0.18% to 0.38%. The percentage of incident prescriptions with a diagnosis of psychosis decreased from 54.1% to 47.5%. Antipsychotics have been increasingly prescribed in the general population, children, and older patients. There is an increase in second-generation antipsychotic prescribing.

A contribution from the advance project.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4245,"Assessment of drug and vaccine effects by combining information from different healthcare databases in the european union requires extensive efforts in the harmonization of codes as different vocabularies are being used across countries. In this paper, we present a web application called codemapper, which assists in the mapping of case definitions to codes from different vocabularies, while keeping a transparent record of the complete mapping process. Codemapper builds upon coding vocabularies contained in the metathesaurus of the unified medical language system. The mapping approach consists of three phases. First, medical concepts are automatically identified in a free-text case definition. Second, the user revises the set of medical concepts by adding or removing concepts, or expanding them to related concepts that are more general or more specific. Finally, the selected concepts are projected to codes from the targeted coding vocabularies. We evaluated the application by comparing codes that were automatically generated from case definitions by applying codemapper's concept identification and successive concept expansion, with reference codes that were manually created in a previous epidemiological study. Automated concept identification alone had a sensitivity of 0.246 and positive predictive value (ppv) of 0.420 for reproducing the reference codes. Three successive steps of concept expansion increased sensitivity to 0.953 and ppv to 0.616. Automatic concept identification in the case definition alone was insufficient to reproduce the reference codes, but codemapper's operations for concept expansion provide an effective, efficient, and transparent way for reproducing the reference codes.",28657162

We selected adverse drug reaction (adr) reports on h1-antihistamines in children (0-16 years) up to june 2014 from vigibase. Adrs were codified according to meddra terminology. The reporting odds ratios (rors) with 95% confidence for drug-reaction pairs were calculated. The analysis was performed on 8918 reports related to antihistamines, corresponding to 19503 drug reaction pairs for 68 different drugs. Most of reports involved children aged 2 to 6 years (32%) and 6 to 12 years (34%). Most reported drugs were cetirizine (1608 reports, corresponding to 18%), loratadine (16%), and diphenhydramine (10%). Adrs were classified as serious in 23% of cases, and 400 cases had a fatal outcome. We found a significant associations for several drug-reaction pairs such as levocetirizine and epilepsy (ror, 6.57; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.51-28.53) and chlorphenamine and toxic epidermal necrolysis (ror, 7.29; 95% ci, 2.39-22.2). H1-antihistamines are among the most used drugs in pediatrics, also in an off-label manner. Our data highlights associations with serious and unexpected adrs. Educative intervention to clinicians and parents are needed to help doctors to make proper choices on the drug treatment and for the early detection of adrs to maximize the benefits and reduce the risk of adrs in these patients.",28653802

In addition to disproportionate reporting patterns, it also accounts for the completeness, recency, and geographic spread of individual case reporting, as well as the availability of case narratives. Previous retrospective analysis suggested that vigirank performed better than disproportionality analysis alone. The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate its prospective performance. The evaluation of vigirank was based on real-world signal detection in vigibase. In may 2014, vigirank scores were computed for pairs of new drugs and who adverse reaction terminology critical terms with at most 30 reports from at least 2 countries. Initial manual assessments were performed in order of descending score, selecting a subset of drug-adverse drug reaction pairs for in-depth expert assessment. The primary performance metric was the proportion of initial assessments that were decided signals during in-depth assessment. As comparator, the historical performance for disproportionality- guided signal detection in vigibase was computed from a corresponding cohort of drug-adverse drug reaction pairs assessed between 2009 and 2013. During this period, the requirement for initial manual assessment was a positive lower endpoint of the 95% credibility interval of the information component measure of disproportionality, observed for the first time. 194 initial assessments suggested by vigirank's ordering eventually resulted in 6 (3.1%) signals. Disproportionality analysis yielded 19 signals from 1592 initial assessments (1.2%; p < .05). Combining multiple strength-of-evidence aspects as in vigirank significantly outperformed disproportionality analysis alone in real-world pharmacovigilance signal detection, for vigibase.",28653790

The primary objective was to study online posts that endorsed continued use of oxycontin or a switch from oxycontin to another formulation of oxycodone or another substance altogether following the introduction of the adf. A secondary objective was to determine whether posts revealed that the adf led to cessation of oxycontin use. Data were collected with the researched abuse, diversion, and addiction-related surveillance system web monitoring program, an online surveillance system that collects and organizes posts about prescription drugs from social media websites, blogs, and forums from 3q2009 to 4q2014 using a commercially available web platform. Posts were categorized by whether they conveyed a switch to drugs other than reformulated oxycontin or a continuation of reformulated oxycontin abuse. ""switch posts"" primarily discussed switching to immediate-release opioids. ""continue abusing"" posts identified tampering strategies for alternate routes of administration, oral use, and continued use although post authors were generally unhappy with the experience. No reference to oxycontin cessation as a function of the introduction of the adf was found; however, discontinued use was discussed. Web monitoring data are useful for capturing cross sections of internet conversation reflecting reactions to new drug formulations. These data support the notion that users will gravitate to non-adfs generally, and to immediate-release non-adf opioid formulations, specifically, as long as these options remain on the market.",28653782

Therefore, it is important to understand what influences prescribers' choice. This study examines the changes in use pattern of all statins in england (1998-2015). The study focuses on the use of simvastatin and atorvastatin before and after their patent expiry and rosuvastatin, to investigate the impact of the reduced acquisition costs on prescribing. Interrupted time series analysis of primary care use data from the health and social care information centre database from 1998 to 2015. Primary care expenditure on statins increased by 125% during the period 1998 to 2004 driven by branded simvastatin and atorvastatin. Before 2003, the rate of use of more potent branded atorvastatin exceeds branded simvastatin. Between 2004 and 2011, the less potent but less expensive agent generic simvastatin has the higher utilisation rate (66%). Since 2012, the more potent agent but less expensive generic atorvastatin has the higher utilisation rate (50%). The more potent branded rosuvastatin failed to make a significant impact on the english statins market. The availability of generic statins has reduced overall expenditure significantly. When there is a significant price difference, acquisition cost appears to be the main influencing factor in prescribing statins, but, when costs are similar, potency is a key factor. This suggests that english prescribers are cost sensitive and appear to be prepared to trade marginal benefit for savings.",28612964

We identified the biosimilar which was reported as the suspected drug in more than 100 individual case safety reports in europe. Then, we specified the top ranking 10 pts in the cases reported with neupogen® or each biosimilar as the suspected drug. We also compared the tto of the most reported pts using the data about the onset date of the pt and the start date of filgrastim. We used kolmogorov-smirnov method to detect significant difference. The total icsr numbers with neupogen® and 3 biosimilars, zarzio®, nivestim®, and tevagrastim® were 1,301, 295, 156, and 127, respectively, in europe. The most reported pts with neupogen® were bone pain, pyrexia, and dyspnoea. The tto of bone pain and pyrexia with zarzio® (n: 22 and 16, median: 1 and 0.5 days) were significantly shorter than those with neupogen® (p < 0.01, n: 72 and 33, median: 3.5 and 3 days), respectively. The most reported pts with biosimilars were drug ineffective and neutropenia.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of classifying medication exposure using ehr prescribing (ehr-rx) data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with linked claims and ehr data in optumlabs™ data warehouse. The agreement between ehr-rx data and pharmacy claims (pc-rx) data (for 40 medications) was determined using the positive predictive value (ppv) and medication possession ratio (mpr)-calculated in 1- and 12-month medication exposure periods (meps). Secondary analyses were restricted to incident vs prevalent ehr-rxs, age ≥65 vs <65, white vs black race, males vs females, and number of ehr-rxs. The validity metrics varied substantially among the 40 medications assessed. Across all medications, the period ppv and mpr were 62% and 63% in the 1-month mep. They were 78% and 43% in the 12-month mep. Overall, ppv and mpr were higher for patients with a prevalent ehr-rx and age <65. Despite substantial variability among different medications, there was very good agreement between ehr-rx data and pc-rx data. To maximize the validity of classifying medication exposure with ehr prescribing data, researchers may consider using longer meps (eg, 12 months) and potentially require multiple ehr-rxs to classify baseline medication exposure.",28608510

A population-based cohort study including 9825 deliveries exposed to an antidepressant between 9 months before last menstrual date through to delivery, from january 2005 to december 2010 in the lombardy region of italy, was conducted. We evaluated the prevalence ratio (pr) of low apgar score, small for gestational age, intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia, neonatal convulsion, and other respiratory conditions, among infants born to mothers exposed to an antidepressant during pregnancy using log-binomial regression analysis. Fine stratification was applied to the propensity score to account for all potential confounders. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses restricted to specific types of antidepressant, time of exposure, and women with vaginal deliveries and full-term births were also performed. A total of 33.4% of women filled at least one prescription during pregnancy.

The 2004 black-box warning had a significant and immediate effect on the prescribing of ad. However, this drop was not sustained, and 5 years after the advisory ad prescribing rates reversed direction and started to rise. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors dominated as the most common ad prescribed throughout the study period, increasing from 66% prior to the black-box warning to 83.12% after 2009.

One third disagreed that it is less risky to use paracetamol compared with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Three-quarters identified liver damage as a potential consequence of exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose. The likelihood of a high-risk perception was higher in women compared with men, and increased with age. No association was found between risk perception and educational status. Participants aged 18 to 25 years had the same ability to identify risks of overdose as did those aged 26 to 65, but expressed more careless attitudes towards use.

Data of patients who were first prescribed statins between 2009 and 2011 were extracted from electronic medical records. Patients with normal blood glucose or prediabetes were observed for 4 years after initiation of statin therapy. A total of 2890 patients were included in our study and analyzed on the basis of the first statin they were prescribed. The incidence rate of dm in patients with prediabetes was 1.72 times that of patients with normal glucose levels (odds ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval = 1.41-2.10, p < .001).

Regarding the progression from normal blood glucose or prediabetes to dm, there were no significant differences among all statins. Lower dm incidence in patients prescribed pitavastatin appears to be primarily because of the lower rate of progression from normal blood glucose to prediabetes. These findings indicate that avoiding statins because of dm risk is unjustified and that clinicians should prescribe statins from the appropriate potency group.",28556206

From the ims lifelink data (2001-2009), we identified dmpa and oral combined hormonal contraceptive (chc) users without a prescription claim 6 months before and after the first and last claim. Episodes were defined as all contiguous claims with no more than 90-day dmpa or 30-day chc between claims. Days' supply (chc) and 90-day duration (dmpa) was used to determine episodes. We used interrupted time series to evaluate changes in the mean episode length and proportion of episodes >2 years before and after the food and drug administration's november 2004 boxed warning. Stratified analyses by birth cohort were conducted. From 2001 to 2009, 126 528 dmpa and 651 356 chc episodes were used for segmented regression. For the dmpa cohort, there was an immediate decline in the mean duration (-34.7 days [confidence interval: -45.4 to -24.1]) and episodes >2 years (-1.9% [confidence interval: -2.9% to -1.1%]) after the boxed warning. We did not observe any change in mean duration or episodes >2 years for the chc cohort. The largest declines in mean duration and proportion >2 years were seen with the oldest women. We observed a modest decline in the mean duration and episodes >2 years for dmpa use immediately after the boxed warning not observed among chc users. In the stratified analysis, we saw declines in the duration of use >2 years in all age groups, except adolescents who continue to use dmpa for longer than 2 years. Published 2017.

All signals from 2010 until 2015 were included. First, we investigated how many patient reports were present in the signals and the characteristics of these reports compared to the health care professional and marketing authorization holders' reports. In addition to source, the analysis included atc code of the drug, meddra® system organ class and preferred term for the adverse drug reaction (adr), seriousness of the adr, and 7 other factors like reports on over-the-counter medication, and how often an adr listed in the important medical event terms list was present. Secondly, we determined the proportion of reports submitted by the individual groups to signals, in a cross-sectional manner. A total of 150 signals were included, including 1691 adr reports. Our results show that 26.3% of all adr reports in dutch drug safety signals were reported by patients, and 30.5% of the patient reports in the signals contained one or more terms listed as important medical events. The proportion of reports by patients which were included the signals was 2% and 3.9% for health care professional reports and 0.2% for marketing authorization holders reports.

We evaluated a two-step multiple imputation approach based on complementary internal validation data obtained from two subsamples of study participants to reduce bias in hazard ratio (hr) estimates in cox regressions. We illustrated this approach using data from a surveyed sample of 6247 individuals in a study of statin-diabetes association in quebec. We corrected diabetes status and onset assessed from health administrative data against self-reported diabetes and/or elevated fasting blood glucose (fbg) assessed in subsamples. The association between statin use and new onset diabetes was evaluated using administrative data and the corrected data. By simulation, we assessed the performance of this method varying the true hr, sensitivity, specificity, and the size of validation subsamples. The adjusted hr of new onset diabetes among statin users versus non-users was 1.61 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.38) using administrative data only, 1.49 (0.95-2.34) when diabetes status and onset were corrected based on self-report and undiagnosed diabetes (fbg ≥ 7 mmol/l), and 1.36 (0.92-2.01) when corrected for self-report and undiagnosed diabetes/impaired fbg (≥ 6 mmol/l). In simulations, the multiple imputation approach yielded less biased hr estimates and appropriate coverage for both non-differential and differential misclassification. Large variations in the corrected hr estimates were observed using validation subsamples with low participation proportion. The bias correction was sometimes outweighed by the uncertainty introduced by the unknown time of event occurrence. Multiple imputation is useful to correct for outcome misclassification in time-to-event analyses if complementary validation data are available from subsamples.

Ras blocker prescriptions, issued between 01/01/2009-30/06/2015, were extracted from the clinical practice research datalink to estimate the quarterly prevalence (number of patients with at least one co-prescription) and incidence (number of patients first receiving a ras blocker co-prescription) of co-prescribing. Two different ras blockers prescribed on the same day constituted a co-prescription. A total of 880 364 patients were prescribed a single ras blocker during the study period. Prevalence of co-prescribing increased from 4812 patients per million person-years in q1 2009 to 4865 in q1 2010. A reduction then occurred decreasing to 2901 patients per million person-years in q2 2014 when the eu review concluded and continued to decrease thereafter despite a continued increase in the prevalence of prescribing of a single ras blocker. Incidence of new co-prescribing decreased from 454 patients per million person-years in q1 2009 to 159 in q2 2014, but remained relatively constant at ~119 patients per million person-years on average after the eu review concluded. A total of 96% of co-prescriptions were for an ace inhibitor + arb, and 4% accounted for an ace inhibitor or arb + renin inhibitor. Recently, there has been a decrease in the prevalence and incidence of ras blocker co-prescribing. Reassuringly, overall co-prescribing reduced in line with recommendations, although there was a decreasing trend prior to this likely due in part to prior publication of the data used in the eu review. © 2017 crown copyright.

However, no apparent studies have reported data from law enforcement on the diversion and misuse of gabapentin. Case report data are drawn from a quarterly survey of prescription drug diversion completed by a national sample of law enforcement and regulatory agencies who engage in drug diversion investigations. Rates of gabapentin diversion per 100 000 population were calculated for each quarter from 2002 through 2015. Qualitative data are drawn from a brief questionnaire completed by a subsample of survey respondents and were organized and presented by theme. In total, 407 new cases of diverted gabapentin were reported during the time period, with diversion rates steadily increasing from zero cases in the first 2 quarters of 2002 to a high of 0.027 cases per 100 000 population in the fourth quarter of 2015. Qualitative data suggest that gabapentin is being misused in conjunction with prescription opioids and that gabapentin and heroin are being combined and consumed together. Law enforcement reporters found these drug use trends to be contributing to gabapentin diversion. The recent increase in gabapentin diversion appears to be related to the opioid epidemic, based on law enforcement descriptions of gabapentin being misused in combination with opioids. Yet epidemiological data related to this finding is limited and research conducted among gabapentin misusers is needed to understand this problem in more depth. Greater monitoring of gabapentin abuse and diversion appear warranted.",28493425

Identifying incident cancer in these databases is crucial. This study aimed to develop algorithms to estimate cancer incidence by using health administrative databases and to examine the accuracy of the algorithms in terms of national cancer incidence rates estimated from registries. We identified a cohort of 463 033 participants on 1 january 2012 in the echantillon généraliste des bénéficiaires (egb; a representative sample of the french healthcare insurance system). The egb contains data on long-term chronic disease (ltd) status, reimbursed outpatient treatments and procedures, and hospitalizations (including discharge diagnoses, and costly medical procedures and drugs). After excluding cases of prevalent cancer, we applied 15 algorithms to estimate the cancer incidence rates separately for men and women in 2012 and compared them to the national cancer incidence rates estimated from french registries by indirect age and sex standardization. The most accurate algorithm for men combined information from ltd status, outpatient anticancer drugs, radiotherapy sessions and primary or related discharge diagnosis of cancer, although it underestimated the cancer incidence (standardized incidence ratio (sir) 0.85 [0.80-0.90]). For women, the best algorithm used the same definition of the algorithm for men but restricted hospital discharge to only primary or related diagnosis with an additional inpatient procedure or drug reimbursement related to cancer and gave comparable estimates to those from registries (sir 1.00 [0.94-1.06]). The algorithms proposed could be used for cancer incidence monitoring and for future etiological cancer studies involving french healthcare databases.

This study examined the association between amount of industry payments to prescribers and generic drug prescribing rates among medicare part d prescribers. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 770 095 medicare part d prescribers after linking the 2013 national open payments data with 2013 medicare provider utilization and payment data. The exposure variable was the categorized amount of total industry payments to prescribers (i.e., meals, travel, research, and ownership). The outcome was prescriber's annual generic drug prescribing rate. Multivariable generalized linear regression models were used to examine the association between the amount of industry payments and prescriber's annual generic drug prescribing rates, controlling for prescriber's demographic and practice characteristics. In this sample, over one-third (38.0%) of medicare part d prescribers received industry payments in 2013. The mean annual generic drug prescribing rate was highest among prescribers receiving no payments and lowest among those receiving more than $500 of industry payments (77.5% vs. 71.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The receipt of industry payments was independently associated with prescribers' generic drug prescribing rate; higher payments corresponded with lower generic drug prescribing rates. Other prescriber characteristics associated with higher annual generic drug prescribing rate included male sex, non-northeast region, specialty, and patient volume. Receipt of industry payments was associated with a decreased rate of generic drug prescribing. How this affects patient care and total medical costs warrants further study.

We used data from a prospective study of 184 older adults who underwent aortic valve replacement at a single academic medical center to evaluate the following delirium-identification algorithms: (1) international classification of diseases (icd) diagnosis codes for delirium; (2) antipsychotics use; (3) either icd diagnosis codes or antipsychotics use; and (4) both icd diagnosis codes and antipsychotics use. These algorithms were evaluated against a validated bedside assessment, the confusion assessment method, and a validated delirium severity scale, the cam-s. Delirium occurred in 66 patients (36%), of which 14 (21%) had hyperactive or mixed features and 15 (23%) had severe delirium. Icd diagnosis codes for delirium were present in 15 patients (8%). Antipsychotics were used in 13 patients (7%). Icd diagnosis codes alone and antipsychotics use alone had comparable sensitivity (18% vs. 18%) and specificity (98% vs. 99%). Defining delirium using either icd diagnosis codes or antipsychotics use, sensitivity improved to 30% with little change in specificity (97%). This algorithm showed higher sensitivity for hyperactive or mixed delirium (64%) and severe delirium (73%). Requiring both icd diagnosis codes and antipsychotics use resulted in perfect specificity but low sensitivity (6%). Delirium-identification algorithms in claims data have low sensitivity and high specificity. Defining delirium using icd diagnosis codes or antipsychotics use performs better than considering either type of information alone. This information should inform the design and interpretation of claims-based comparative effectiveness and safety research. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28485014

An application of the reverse waiting time distribution.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4217,"To introduce the reverse waiting time distribution (wtd) and show how it can be used to estimate stopping fractions and real-time prevalence of treatment in pharmacoepidemiological studies. The reverse wtd is the distribution of time from the last dispensed prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of it. It is a mirrored version of the ordinary wtd, which considers the first dispensed prescription of patients within a time window. Based on renewal process theory, the reverse wtd can be analyzed as an ordinary wtd with maximum likelihood estimation. Based on danish prescription data for nsaids, warfarin, bendroflumethiazide and levothyroxine in the years 2013 and 2014, we compared estimates from the reverse wtd to those of the ordinary wtd regarding prevalence, stopping fractions and the 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distributions. The fraction of all users in 2013 stopping treatment varied from 73.1% (nsaid) to 9.3% (levothyroxine). Comparing prevalence estimates of the reverse wtd at the end of 2013 with those of the ordinary wtd at the start of 2014, relative differences did not exceed 4.8%. For the estimated 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distribution, differences did not exceed 3.3%. The reverse wtd allows estimation of the aggregated fraction of users stopping treatment and prevalence, especially when the wtd reliably separates current users from users who have stopped treatment. It may replace ad-hoc decision rules for automated implementations, and it yields estimates of real-time prevalence. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28474439

We developed an estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation for the reverse waiting time distribution (wtd), which is the distribution of time from the last prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of the time window. The reverse wtd consists of two distinctly different components: one component for prevalent users and one for patients stopping treatment. We extended the model to allow parameters of the reverse wtd to depend on linear combinations of covariates to obtain estimates and confidence intervals for percentiles of the inter-arrival density (time from one prescription to the subsequent). We applied the method to redemptions of warfarin, using the amount of drug filled, patient sex and patient age as covariates. The estimated prescription durations increased with redeemed amount and age. Women generally had longer prescription durations, which increased more with age than men. For 70-year-old women redeeming 300+ pills, we predicted a 95th percentile of the inter-arrival density of 225 (95%ci: 201, 249) days. For 50-year-old men redeeming 100 pills, the corresponding prediction was 97 (88, 106) days. The algorithm allows estimation of prescription durations based on the reverse wtd, which can depend upon observed covariates. Statistical uncertainty intervals and tests allow statistical inference on the influence of observed patient and prescription characteristics. The method may replace ad hoc decision rules.

This study aimed to assess whether zolpidem dscs were associated with prescribing-pattern changes between january 2011 and december 2013. We assessed overall dispensings of zolpidem-containing products between january 2011 and december 2013 by conducting a time-series analysis. Analyses were stratified by gender because the dsc contained gender-specific information. Participants were patients drawn from the optum clinformatics data source of commercially insured people in the usa. We evaluated changes in mean prescribed dose of the two drugs and health care utilization metrics. Each month of the study, more than 80 000 patients received a zolpidem-containing product and approximately one-tenth as many received eszopiclone. The two dscs did not affect the downward trajectory of new zolpidem prescriptions. However, there was an increase in use of lower-dose forms of zolpidem (30% increase, p < 0.001), coupled with a reduction in higher-dose forms (13% decrease, p = 0.03), so that the average dose decreased after the dscs (from 9.7 mg to 9.4 mg, p < 0.001), a change that was not seen with eszopiclone (from 2.74 mg to 2.74 mg, p = 0.45). The dscs related to zolpidem-containing products shifted prescribing toward the lower-dose formulations, consistent with the recommendations in the dscs.

This study is based on a multinational, web-based study conducted in 15 european countries from october 2011 to february 2012. Information about maternal demographics, illnesses, and medication use during pregnancy was collected via an electronic questionnaire. Pregnant women and new mothers with a child less than 1-year-old could participate. The swedish, australian, and u.s. Risk classification systems were used to evaluate medication safety. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation models were used. A total of 587 medications were reported by the study sample (n = 6657). Sixty-nine percent of the women used medications classified as safe, 28% used medications classified as risky, and 3% used medications with no classification available. Both socio-demographic and medical factors were associated with the use of risky medications during pregnancy. Having a chronic disorder was the factor with the strongest association with the use of risky medications during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio = 3.99, 95% confidence interval 3.54-4.49). The majority of women used medications classified as safe to use during pregnancy. However, a considerable proportion of women still used medications classified as risky. Having a chronic disorder was an important driver for using risky medications. Such use may still be appropriate when considering the woman's underlying condition. Pre-pregnancy counselling is important to ensure safe medication use for both mother and child. © 2017 the authors. Pharmacoepidemiology & drug safety published by john wiley & sons ltd.",28449197

This is a population-based cohort study including all live singleton births in denmark from 1 january 1997 to 31 december 2008. Children born to mothers who used β2aa during pregnancy were categorized as exposed, and all other children were included in the unexposed group. Cases of asds were identified from the danish psychiatric central register and the danish patient register. Incidence rate ratio (irr) and 95% confidence interval were estimated by poisson regression models. Among 751 888 children in the cohort, 9098 (1.21%) received a diagnosis of asds. We observed an increased risk of asds in the exposed children (irr = 1.28, 1.11-1.47), especially for those who were exposed during the second trimester period (irr = 1.38, 1.14-1.67). However, when extending the exposure time window to 1 year prior to pregnancy, we observed a similar association in children born to women who received β2aa treatment during pregnancy (irr = 1.33, 1.11-1.59) to that in children born to women who received β2aa treatment 1 year prior to pregnancy (irr = 1.35, 1.17-1.56). Our finding suggested that children born to women who used β2aa during pregnancy have an increased risk of asds in later life, which is more likely due to underlying maternal diseases rather than the exposure to β2aa itself. However, further study, which would better differentiate the effects between indication and medicine, is needed to corroborate the finding. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28422339

Using the uk clinical practice research datalink, we identified patients with ckd (two measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73m  for ≥3 months) between april 2004 and march 2014. We compared those with ckd to a general population cohort without ckd (matched on age, sex, general practice, and calendar time [index date]). We identified any antidepressant prescribing in the six months prior to index date (prevalence), the first prescription after index date among non-prevalent users (incidence), and recorded diagnoses (indication). We compared antidepressant choice between patients with and without ckd among patients with a diagnosis of depression. There were 242 349 matched patients (median age 76 [interquartile range 70-82], male 39.3%) with and without ckd. Prevalence of antidepressant prescribing was 16.3 and 11.9%, and incidence was 57.2 and 42.4/1000 person-years, in patients with and without ckd, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, ckd remained associated with higher prevalence and incidence of antidepressant prescription. Regardless of ckd status, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were predominantly prescribed for depression or anxiety, while tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed for neuropathic pain or other reasons. Antidepressant choice was similar in depressed patients with and without ckd. The rate of antidepressant prescribing was nearly one and a half times higher among people with ckd than in the general population. © 2017 the authors.

Simulation studies have recommended expanding the look-back approach to all available data (aad) for binary indicators of diagnoses, procedures, and medications, but there have been few real data analyses using this approach. The objective of the study is to explore the impact on treatment effect estimates and covariate prevalence of expanding the look-back period within five validated studies in the aetion system, a rapid cycle analytics platform. We reran the five studies and assessed covariates using (i) a fixed window approach (usually 180 days before treatment initiation), (ii) aad prior to treatment initiation, and (iii) aad with a categorized by recency approach, where the most recent occurrence of a covariate was labeled as recent (occurring within the fixed window) or past (before the start of the fixed window). For each covariate assessment approach, we adjusted for covariates via propensity score matching. All studies had at least one covariate that had an increase in prevalence of 15% or higher from the fixed window to the aad approach. However, there was little change in treatment effect estimates resulting from differing covariate assessment approaches. For example, in a study of acute coronary syndrome in high-intensity versus low-intensity statin users, the estimated hazard ratio from the fixed window approach was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.98, 1.25) versus 1.21 (1.07, 1.37) when using aad and 1.19 (1.05, 1.35) using categorized by recency. Expanding the baseline period to aad improved covariate sensitivity by capturing data that would otherwise be missed yet did not meaningfully change the overall treatment effect estimates compared with the fixed window approach.

The overall aim of activities in this area is to assess the performance of risk minimization measures implemented in order to ensure a positive benefit-risk balance in patients treated with a medicinal product. Following a review of the relevant literature, we developed a conceptual framework consisting of four domains (data, knowledge, behaviour and outcomes) intended for the evaluation of risk minimization measures put into practice in the danish health-care system. For the implementation of the framework, four classes of monitoring variables can be named and defined: patient descriptors, performance-related indicators of knowledge, behaviour and outcomes. We reviewed the features of the framework when applied to historical, real-world data following the introduction of dabigatran in denmark for the prophylactic treatment of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The application of the framework provided useful graphical displays and an opportunity for a statistical evaluation (interrupted time series analysis) of a regulatory intervention. © 2017 commonwealth of australia.

We selected 3331 beneficiaries (women: 2272; men: 559) for whom we requested 3625 medical records. Overall, we received 1738 [47.9% (95%ci 46.3%, 49.6%)] of the requested medical records. We observed small differences in the characteristics of the total population with aesis compared with those randomly selected for retrieval; however, no differences were seen between those selected and those retrieved. We retrieved 54.7% of records requested from hospitals compared with 26.3% of records requested from physician offices (p < 0.001). Retrieval did not differ by sex or vital status of the beneficiaries. Our national medical record validation study of claims-based algorithms produced a modest retrieval rate. The medical record procedures outlined in this paper could have led to the improved retrieval from our previous medical record retrieval study. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28374489

However, the validity of fracture in the databases is needed to ensure the reliability of data. We aimed to assess the validity of international classification of diseases, 9th revision (icd-9) code algorithms for identifying major osteoporotic fracture in the clinical data analysis and reporting system (cdars) in hong kong. The cdars is a database developed by the hong kong hospital authority for research purpose. We used icd-9 code algorithm for identifying major osteoporotic fracture, including vertebral fracture, humerus fracture, forearm/wrist fracture, and hip fracture, in cdars in 2005-2016. As high positive predictive value (ppv) is critically important in epidemiology research, we sought to determine the ppv of fracture diagnostic code in terms of icd-9 relative to the radiography imaging and clinical notes. A total of 380 major osteoporotic fracture cases (vertebral fracture: 101 cases; humerus fracture: 81 cases; forearm/wrist fracture: 94 cases; and hip fracture: 104 cases) were randomly selected and validated. In 380 fracture cases, the overall ppv was 96.8%. In subgroup analysis, ppv of 100% was observed for hip, humerus, and forearm/wrist fractures, whereas ppv of 86% was observed for vertebral fracture. The use of icd-9 code algorithm to identify major osteoporotic fracture in cdars is a valid tool with a very high ppv. However, cautious interpretation is required when the study focuses on incident vertebral fracture. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28371079

A case-control study nested into a cohort of elderly patients on treatment with statins for cardiovascular secondary prevention was performed on this issue. The cohort was formed by 13 875 individuals aged ≥65 years from several italian health units receiving statins after hospital discharge for cardiovascular outcomes. From this cohort, 964 patients who experienced fracture were identified (i.e., cases). Up to five controls were randomly selected for each case from the underlying cohort. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the risk of fracture associated with adherence to statins, which was measured from the proportion of days covered (pdc) by treatment. A set of sensitivity analyses was performed in order to account for sources of systematic uncertainty. Compared with patients with low adherence (pdc ≤ 40%), those on intermediate (pdc 41-80%) and high (pdc > 80%) adherence exhibited a risk reduction of 21% (95% confidence interval 6% to 23%) and 25% (7% to 40%). Similar effects were observed among patients younger and older than 80 years, as well as among men, while there was no evidence that adherence to statins affected the risk of fracture among women. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the associations were consistent and robust. Use of statins for secondary cardiovascular prevention is associated with fracture risk reduction in elderly people. Further studies are required to better clarify the statin-fracture association in postmenopausal women. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28370905

We used population-based administrative data from three canadian provinces. All individuals receiving dmt (interferon-b-1b, interferon-b-1a, or glatiramer acetate) between january 1, 1996, and december 31, 2011 (british columbia); march 31, 2012 (manitoba); or march 31, 2014, (saskatchewan) were included. Adherence was estimated for the first year of dmt (year 0), using the medication possession ratio (mpr). The association between optimal adherence (mpr ≥ 80%) and all-cause and ms-specific hospitalizations in the subsequent 1, 2, and 5 years was assessed using hurdle poisson and logistic regression. Rate and odds ratios were adjusted (arr and aor) for sociodemographic factors and prior health-care utilization. Overall, 4746 subjects were followed for a mean 7.8 (sd 4.0) years; 3598 (76%) were women. Optimal dmt adherence was achieved in 3564/4746 (75.1%) subjects. Subsequent all-cause and ms-specific hospitalizations were lower for subjects with optimal versus suboptimal adherence, but none reached statistical significance (1-year period, arr = 0.77, 95%ci: 0.47-1.26; aor = 0.80, 95%ci: 0.52-1.25). Similar findings were observed in the 2-year and 5-year periods. Prior health-care utilization (hospitalizations and medications) was associated with future hospitalizations; for every additional medication class, the 5-year all-cause hospitalization rate and likelihood of an ms-specific hospitalization increased by 5% and 11%, respectively (arr = 1.05, 95%ci: 1.02-1.07; and aor = 1.11, 95%ci: 1.07-1.14). Hospitalization rates were lower in subjects with optimal dmt adherence, but findings were not statistically significant. Prior hospitalization and polypharmacy were associated with increased risk for future hospitalizations in ms. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28370875

A case-control study was performed within conventional nsaids and/or selective cox-2 inhibitors users identified from the dutch pharmo record linkage system in the period 1998-2012. Cases were patients aged ≥18 years with a first hospital admission for pub. For each case, up to four controls were matched for age and sex at the date a case was hospitalized (index date). Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ors). At the index date, 2634 cases and 5074 controls were current users of conventional nsaids or selective cox-2 inhibitors. Compared with conventional nsaids, selective cox-2 inhibitors with ppis had the lowest risk of pub (adjusted or 0.51, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.35-0.73) followed by selective cox-2 inhibitors (adjusted or 0.66, 95%ci: 0.48-0.89) and conventional nsaids with ppis (adjusted or 0.79, 95%ci: 0.68-0.92). Compared with conventional nsaids, the risk of pub was lower for those aged ≥75 years taking conventional nsaids with ppis compared with younger patients (adjusted interaction or 0.79, 95%ci: 0.64-0.99). However, those aged ≥75 years taking selective cox-2 inhibitors, the risk was higher compared with younger patients (adjusted interaction or 1.22, 95%ci: 1.01-1.47). Selective cox-2 inhibitors with ppis, selective cox-2 inhibitors, and conventional nsaids with ppis were associated with lower risks of pub compared with conventional nsaids.

This study aimed to compare receipt of screening mammography and the incidence of screen-detected breast cancer between metformin and sulfonylurea initiators. We used 2006-2014 us medicare claims to identify initiators of metformin or sulfonylurea aged 65+ years continuously enrolled in parts a/b for ≥2 years pre-initiation and ≥2 years post-initiation. We reported frequencies of screening mammograms and screen-detected breast cancer in 1 year pre-initiation among all cohort members and in 1 year post-initiation among cancer-free cohort members. Weighted screening risk differences (rds) were estimated comparing metformin to sulfonylurea group. We identified 41,436 and 13,367 initiators of metformin and sulfonylurea, 35% and 24% of which had ≥1 screening mammogram in 1 year pre-initiation (weighted rd: 6 percentage points; 95% ci: 5 to 7), respectively. The weighted rd for screen-detected breast cancer associated with metformin was 0.00 percentage points (95% ci: -0.09 to 0.09). Among cancer-free cohort members, metformin initiators had 5 percentage points (95% ci: 4 to 6) and 0.11 percentage points (95% ci: -0.02 to 0.23) absolute risk excess of screening mammography and screen-detected breast cancer in 1 year post-initiation, compared with sulfonylurea initiators, respectively. Metformin initiators were more likely to receive screening mammograms than sulfonylurea initiators pre- and post-initiation, indicating possible detection bias due to differential screening mammography. Researchers should be aware of the potential for more screening mammograms pre- and post-initiation when interpreting the findings of metformin on breast cancer incidence.

Because of the opioid antagonism of naltrexone, ldn users are probably often warned against concomitant use with opioids. In this study, based on data from the norwegian prescription database, we examine changes in opioid consumption after starting ldn therapy. We included all norwegian patients (n = 3775) with at least one recorded ldn prescription in 2013 and at least one dispensed opioid prescription during the 365 days preceding the first ldn prescription. We allocated the patients into three subgroups depending on the number of collected ldn prescriptions and recorded the number of defined daily doses (ddds) on collected prescriptions on opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other analgesics and antipyretics from the same patients. Among the patients collecting ≥4 ldn prescriptions, annual average opioid consumption was reduced by 41 ddds per person (46%) compared with that of the previous year. The reduction was 12 ddds per person (15%) among users collecting two to three prescriptions and no change among those collecting only one ldn prescription. We observed no increase in the number of ddds in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other analgesics and antipyretics corresponding to the decrease in opioid use. Possibly, ldn users avoided opioids because of warnings on concomitant use or the patients continuing on ldn were less opioid dependent than those terminating ldn. Therapeutic effects of ldn contributing to lower opioid consumption cannot be ruled out. © 2017 the authors. Pharmacoepidemiology & drug safety published by john wiley & sons ltd.",28370746

The current study was designed to assess patient knowledge and perceptions of the generic drug approval process. We conducted a survey of patients with 10 different chronic diseases. We recruited survey participants from the cvs advisor panel, a proprietary database of 124 621 cvs customers pre-consented to participate in online research activities. We created a survey to collect data on patients' perceptions of the fda's generic drug approval process, as well as their experiences with generic drugs approved using modified bioequivalence approaches used to treat their chronic medical conditions. Our survey of 753 patients with chronic diseases (65% response rate) showed that most (74%) expressed little familiarity with fda's approval process for generic drugs, but nearly all (89%) believed that fda approval ensures the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs. About one-fifth of respondents reported hearing concerns about their generic drugs, most commonly from physicians (35-36%) and the internet (32-38%), but there were no differences in patients' reports of concerns about generic versions of the six study drugs approved using product-specific pathways versus comparator drugs. Patients have little knowledge about the generic drug approval system, but positive belief in the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs. Patients do not appear to have greater concern about generic drugs approved via product-specific pathways. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28370652

This cross-sectional feasibility study was conducted in adults with active and severe asthma registered with the clinical practice research datalink. A set of keywords flagged terms potentially indicative of abpa in free-text comments of patients' emrs to produce a grid on the basis of keywords' hit or miss. The grid was examined for occurrence and concurrence of keywords to discern patterns of concurrence potentially indicative of an underlying diagnosis of abpa. The analyses included 3 653 169 free-text items from 21 054 patients. In total, 52 patients (0.25%) had at least one mention of 'abpa' in their medical record; 67% of these patients also had a mention of 'aspergillus/aspergillosis', 54% of 'bronchiectasis', 42% of 'itraconazole' and 62% of 'ige'. The term 'aspergillus/aspergillosis' occurred with a proportion of 1.84% (n = 387); 9% of these patients also had a mention of 'abpa', and the remaining 91% were potential additional cases of abpa. From the observed concurrence of keywords, we were able to devise a potential algorithm to identify cases with varying degrees of specificity. This study suggests that analysis of free text within asthmatic patients' emrs may be used to identify potential cases of abpa. This could be an efficient approach to identify rare conditions and to quantify their potential burden. © 2017 the authors.

This leads to cyp2d6-mediated drug-drug interactions (ddi). Because systematic evaluations are lacking, we assessed the burden of metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine interaction in the elderly and how these interactions are managed in dutch community pharmacies. Dispensing data were collected from the university of groningen pharmacy database (iadb.nl, 1999-2014) for elderly patients (≥60 years) starting beta-blockers and/or antidepressants. Based on the two main ddi alert systems (g-standard and pharmabase), incidences were divided between signalled (metoprolol-fluoxetine/paroxetine) and not-signalled (metoprolol-alternative antidepressants and alternative beta-blockers-paroxetine/fluoxetine) combinations. Incident users were defined as patients starting at least one signalled or a non-signalled combination. G-standard signalled throughout the study period, whereas pharmabase stopped after 2005. A total of 1763 patients had 2039 metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine co-prescriptions, despite ddi alert systems, and about 57.3% were signalled. The number of metoprolol-alternative antidepressant combinations (incidences = 3150) was higher than alternative beta-blocker-paroxetine/fluoxetine combinations (incidences = 1872). Metoprolol users are more likely to be co-medicated with an alternative antidepressant (incidences = 2320) than paroxetine/fluoxetine users (incidences = 1232) are. The number of paroxetine/fluoxetine users co-prescribed with alternative beta-blockers was comparable to those co-medicated with metoprolol (about 50%). Less than 5% of patients received a substitute therapy after using metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine. Most of the metoprolol users (90%) received a low dose (mean ddd = 0.47) regardless whether they were prescribed paroxetine/fluoxetine. Despite the signalling software, metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine combinations are still observed in the elderly population. The clinical impact of these interactions needs further investigation.

Information on the prevalence and treatment of both conditions in german ra patients is scarce. Using data from a nationwide statutory health insurance fund (barmer gek), 6193 ra patients aged 18 to 79 years were provided with a questionnaire covering a variety of items such as demographics, medical condition and quality of life in 2015. Pain caused by the joint disorder (11-point scale) was classified as none existent/mild, moderate or severe. Depressive symptoms were determined using the world health organization's five-item well-being index and categorized as none existent, mild or moderate/severe. Another item covered additional use of over-the-counter drugs. Data were linked to dispensation records. A total of 3140 ra patients were included. Median age was 66 years (79% female). About 70% of patients were classified as having moderate or severe pain. Depressive symptoms were found in 52% and were far more common among patients with higher pain levels. Analgesic treatment ranged from 45% to 76% (non-opioid analgesics) and from 6% to 33% (opioids) in patients with no/mild pain and those reporting severe pain, respectively. In patients reporting moderate or severe pain, substantially higher prevalences of opioid use were observed among those with depressive symptoms. Depending on depressive symptoms, antidepressant use ranged from 7% to 37%. Overall, over-the-counter drug use varied between 30% and 59%. Pain and depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in german ra patients, often present together and influence each other's treatment. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28345245

Data from registries are a cornerstone of post-marketing surveillance for monitoring the use of medicines in clinical practice. This study was aimed at gaining further insight into the european medicines agency's (ema) requests for new registries and registry studies using existing registries and to review the experience gained in their conduct. European public assessment reports were consulted to identify products for which a request for a registry was made as a condition of the marketing authorisation. All centrally authorised products that received a positive opinion of the ema committee for medicinal products for human use between 1 january 2005 and 31 december 2013 were included. Data regarding registry design and experiences were collected from ema electronic record keeping systems. Of 392 products that received a positive committee for medicinal products for human use opinion during 2005-2013, 31 registries were requested for 30 products in total. Sixty-five percent were product registries whereas 35% were disease registries and 71% of the registries had a primary safety objective. Most commonly reported issues with registries were delayed time to start and low patient accrual rates. The delays found in getting new registries up and running support the need to improve the timeliness of data collection in the post-marketing setting. Methodological challenges met in conducting this study highlighted the need for a clarification of definitions and epidemiological concepts around patient registries. The results will inform the ema patient registry initiative to support use of existing patient registries for the post-authorisation benefit-risk monitoring of medicinal products. © 2017 commonwealth of australia.

This approach was used to define profiles of exposure to anxiolytics/hypnotics during pregnancy and to evaluate the potential effect on newborn health. The study was performed in efemeris database (54 918 mother-children pairs). An estimation of adaptation to extrauterine life was assessed using several criteria especially cardio-respiratory symptoms. A proxy variable called ""neonatal pathology"" was created. The occurrence of this event was studied using two approaches: the standard method comparing exposed and unexposed newborns, the trajectory method comparing the different profiles of exposure. Around 5% of newborns (n = 2768) were identified to be exposed to anxiolytics or hypnotics during pregnancy. Using the standard method, 6.2% of exposed newborns developed a ""neonatal pathology"" against 4.8% of unexposed newborns (odds ratios [or] = 0.9[0.8-1.2], p = 0.7). With the trajectory method taking into account evolution of exposure during pregnancy and treatment intensity, four profiles of pregnant women were identified. A significant difference in the rates of ""neonatal pathologies"" was observed between profiles (p = 0.0002). Newborns of the two profiles exposed in utero to high constant level of anxiolytics or hypnotics were more at risk of developing ""neonatal pathology"" than unexposed newborns (or   = 2.0 [1.0-3.9] and or   = 7.6 [2.8-20.5]). The present study demonstrates the interest of this method based on individual drug trajectories for the evaluation of outcomes in pharmaco-epidemiological studies and more specifically during pregnancy.

The observed differences between oral estrogen and oral estrogen-progestogen combination formulations may be the result of bias from depletion of susceptibles. We used united kingdom's clinical practice research datalink to identify the cohort of all women aged 50 to 79 during 1987-2008, with all incident cases of vte occurring during the study period identified. Using a nested case-control approach, the rate ratios (rrs) of vte with current use of oral estrogen and oral estrogen-progestogen combinations were estimated as a function of duration of use using conditional logistic regression with cubic splines. The cohort of 955 582 postmenopausal women included 23 505 cases of vte matched to 231 562 controls. The risk of vte was increased with current use of oral estrogen (rr 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.37 to 1.63) and oral estrogen-progestogen (rr 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.44 to 1.65), relative to non-use. When assessed by duration of use, the risks with oral formulations were particularly elevated during the first year of use and were reduced subsequently. The phenomenon of depletion of susceptibles should be considered in cohort studies evaluating acute side effects of medications. This can be achieved by estimating the risk as a function not only of current use but also of duration of use. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28326633

The study aims to estimate the effect of receiving a breast cancer diagnosis on antidepressant adherence among women with depression. Using seer-medicare administrative claims, we identified women aged 65+ with newly diagnosed breast cancer between 2008 and 2011, who were diagnosed with depression and used antidepressants during the year before pre-diagnosis year. We compared antidepressant adherence among women with breast cancer to similar women without cancer using generalized estimation equations. Antidepressant adherence was estimated using the proportion of days covered 1 year before and after the index date. We included 1142 women with breast cancer and pre-existing depression and 1142 matched non-cancer patients with pre-existing depression. Mean antidepressant adherence was similar for both groups in the year before and after the index date (all around 0.71); adherence decreased by approximately 0.01 following breast cancer diagnosis in cancer group, with similar reductions among non-cancer group (p = 0.19). However, substantial proportion of patients had inadequate adherence to antidepressants in the post-diagnosis period, and almost 40% of patients in each group discontinued antidepressants over the study period. Antidepressant adherence was not associated with receiving a breast cancer diagnosis beyond what would have been expected in a similar cohort of women without cancer; however, adherence was poor among both groups. Ensuring adequate ongoing depression care is important to improve cancer care and patient quality of life in the long term. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28317314

Warfarin is still used as a first-line anticoagulant, although non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants are currently recommended to manage af. Using a large, unselected national sample of af patients, we evaluated the relationships between quality of warfarin therapy and the risks of thromboembolism, bleeding complications, and mortality. The nationwide finwaf study included 54 568 af patients taking warfarin. Time in the therapeutic range (ttr) was calculated on a continuous basis using the rosendaal method and international normalized ratio values over the previous 60 days. Adjusted cox proportional hazard models were prepared for different ttr levels and major clinical end points. The mean age of patients was 73.1 years (standard deviation 10.8), and 47% were female. The mean follow-up time was 3.2 ± 1.6 years (median 3.4). In the ttr groups of ≤40%, 60-70%, 70-80%, and >80%, the annual risk of stroke was 9.3%, 4.7%, 4.6%, and 3.1%; bleeding events 7.5%, 4.5%, 4.3%, and 2.6%; and overall mortality 20.9%, 8.5%, 6.4%, and 3.1%, respectively. All differences among the ttr groups were highly significant (p < 0.001). The quality of warfarin treatment was strongly associated with the risk of stroke and the prognosis of af patients.

An algorithm was developed to identify af in outpatients initiating oac from medico-administrative data. Among patients initiating oac in 2013 in the french healthcare databases, those treated for orthopaedic indications were excluded. Patients with a history of af or dvt/pe directly identified from available medical data, mainly hospital discharge diagnoses, were considered to be 'confirmed af or dvt/pe patients'. Demographics of these patients and their healthcare utilization data prior to oac initiation were then included in a logistic regression model discriminating af versus dvt/pe indications. The final model selected, comparing c-index, provided an algorithm identifying af from among initially unclassified patients assumed to be either af or dvt/pe outpatients. Among 256 418 patients initiating oac, 37 388 were excluded; 61 329 af and 59 859 dvt/pe patients were directly identified, leaving 88 488 unclassified patients. The final model (c-index: 0.93) included demographics, cardiologist prescriber, hospitalization for stroke, use of antiarrhythmics/beta-blockers/antihypertensive drugs and undergoing a holter/echocardiography procedure, thyroid function tests, but no d-dimer tests. With a specificity of 95% (sensitivity: 65%), 41% of the unclassified patients were assumed to be af outpatients. Similar results were obtained on 250 159 new users in 2014. This algorithm combining inpatient and outpatient claims data performed relatively well to identify af outpatients initiating oac. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28295882

In general, the case sample is available from some source (for example, hospital database, case registry, etc.); however, the reference sample is required to be drawn from the corresponding source population. The required minimum size of the reference sample is an important issue in this regard. In this work, we address the minimum sample size calculation and discuss related issues.

Clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence are required for the implementation of quality of care interventions. Reduction of error-related cost is a key potential benefit of interventions addressing medication error. The aim of this review was to describe and quantify the economic burden associated with medication error. Pubmed, cochrane, embase, cinahl, econlit, abi/inform, business source complete were searched. Studies published 2004-2016 assessing the economic impact of medication error were included. Cost values were expressed in euro 2015. A narrative synthesis was performed. A total of 4572 articles were identified from database searching, and 16 were included in the review. One study met all applicable quality criteria. Fifteen studies expressed economic impact in monetary terms. Mean cost per error per study ranged from €2.58 to €111 727.08. Healthcare costs were used to measure economic impact in 15 of the included studies with one study measuring litigation costs. Four studies included costs incurred in primary care with the remaining 12 measuring hospital costs. Five studies looked at general medication error in a general population with 11 studies reporting the economic impact of an individual type of medication error or error within a specific patient population. Considerable variability existed between studies in terms of financial cost, patients, settings and errors included. Many were of poor quality. Assessment of economic impact was conducted predominantly in the hospital setting with little assessment of primary care impact. Limited parameters were used to establish economic impact.

However, this unobservable exposure time bias is very rarely taken into account in pharmacoepidemiology. The objective was to model unobservable periods due to hospitalization and to assess their impact on risk estimates in the context of the association between benzodiazepines and mortality. A cohort study was identified using the general sample of beneficiaries in france for the period 2006-2012. Benzodiazepines incident users were matched to incident users of antidepressants/non-benzodiazepine sedatives and to controls (non-users) according to age and gender. All-cause mortality at 1 year (cox regression model) was studied using time-dependent variables (exposed/unexposed or under two hypotheses, inpatients are exposed or inpatients are unexposed), complemented with a multistate model based on observable/unobservable/death status. In each group, 57 242 patients were included. All-cause mortality was significantly higher among those exposed to benzodiazepines (adjusted hazard ratio (ahr) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.04, 1.32), as compared with controls. Use of benzodiazepines exposure as a time-dependent variable resulted in significant results after adjustment (ahr = 1.45, 95%ci = 1.16, 1.80). When inpatients were considered as unexposed, all-cause mortality was not significantly increased (ahr = 0.85, 95%ci = 0.76, 1.10), but was significantly augmented when inpatients were considered as exposed (ahr = 2.93, 95%ci = 2.46, 3.48). This study highlights the need to take account of the impact of unobservable exposure periods on risk estimates. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28266748

Subjects were invited to receive three doses of the vaccine (0, 1 and 6 months), and participants who received at least one dose were included in the analysis. Adverse events (aes), adverse drug reactions (adrs) and serious aes (saes) were recorded after each dose. All aes, adrs and saes were presented with exact 95% confidence intervals (ci) (nct01101542). Injection-site pain was the most frequent ae and adr reported by 322 subjects (10.4% [95%ci: 9.4-11.6]); the local pain was transient and lasted 4-7 days in most cases. Dysmenorrhoea and vaginitis were the most common unexpected aes reported by 30 (1.0% [95%ci: 0.7-1.4]) and 16 subjects (0.7% [95%ci: 0.3-0.8]), respectively. Pain (toe pain, leg pain and body pain [one case each]; foot pain [two cases]) was the most common unexpected adr reported by five subjects (0.2% [95%ci: 0.1-0.4]). Four subjects reported a single sae (one case each of exostosis, gastroenteritis, abortion and tonsillitis); none were fatal. All saes were assessed as unlikely to be related to vaccination; gastroenteritis, exostosis and tonsillitis resolved during the study period. This is the first post-marketing surveillance study in korea that provides 6-year safety data for hpv-16/18 as04-adjuvanted vaccine.

This descriptive epidemiological study used claims data from 1038 community pharmacies across japan. Outpatients who were ≥18 years old and receiving their initial antipsychotic prescription during 2006-2012 were evaluated. The annual trends were reported for monotherapies, polypharmacy, antipsychotic doses, and the concurrent prescription of psychotropic medications. The 152 592 outpatients included 101 133 (66%) adults (18-64 years old) and 51 459 (34%) older adults (≥65 years old). Among the adults, second-generation antipsychotic monotherapy prescriptions increased from 49% in 2006 to 71% in 2012, first-generation antipsychotic monotherapy prescriptions decreased from 29 to 14%, and antipsychotic polypharmacy decreased from 23 to 15%, respectively. Among the older adults, second-generation antipsychotic monotherapy prescriptions increased from 64 to 82%, first-generation antipsychotic monotherapy prescriptions decreased from 29 to 12%, and antipsychotic polypharmacy decreased from 7 to 6%, respectively. During the study period, >80% of the adults and >90% of the older adults received antipsychotics at risperidone-equivalent doses of <6 mg/day. Anxiolytics/hypnotics, antidepressants, antiparkinson agents, mood stabilizers, and anti-dementia agents were concurrently prescribed with antipsychotics for 70, 33, 20, 20, and 0.3% of the adults and for 43, 16, 19, 8, and 16% of the older adults, respectively. The present study evaluated large-scale claims-based datasets and found that high-dose prescriptions and antipsychotic polypharmacy among japanese outpatients were not as prevalent as has been previously thought.

Information on all 4966 cases hospitalized in 2008-2010 for acute pancreatitis was retrieved from the finnish national registers on hospital discharges and prescriptions. A total of 24 788 age and sex-matched population-based controls were randomly selected using density sampling. Ace inhibitor use between 1 january 2003 and the index date were determined by the date of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis among the cases. The incidence rate ratios of acute pancreatitis not diagnosed as biliary or alcohol-induced were modeled by conditional logistic regression and adjusted for comorbidities. A total of 1276 (26%) cases and 3946 (16%) controls had been exposed to ace inhibitors. The use of ace inhibitors was associated with an increased incidence rate of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio [or] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.59-1.95). The increase was slightly higher among current new users (or 1.86, 95%ci 1.65-2.09) and somewhat lower among current prevalent (or 1.54, 95%ci 1.35-1.75) and former users (or 1.51, 95%ci 1.31-1.74).

1118,Ertefaie A;Small Ds;Flory Jh;Hennessy S,2017,A tutorial on the use of instrumental variables in pharmacoepidemiology.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4158,"Instrumental variable (iv) methods are used increasingly in pharmacoepidemiology to address unmeasured confounding. In this tutorial, we review the steps used in iv analyses and the underlying assumptions. We also present methods to assess the validity of those assumptions and describe sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of possible violations of those assumptions. Observational studies based on regression or propensity score analyses rely on the untestable assumption that there are no unmeasured confounders. Iv analysis is a tool that removes the bias caused by unmeasured confounding provided that key assumptions (some of which are also untestable) are met. When instruments are valid, iv methods provided unbiased treatment effect estimation in the presence of unmeasured confounders. However, the standard error of the iv estimate is higher than the standard error of non-iv estimates, e.g., regression and propensity score methods. Sensitivity analyses provided insight about the robustness of the iv results to the plausible degrees of violation of assumptions. Iv analysis should be used cautiously because the validity of iv estimates relies on assumptions that are, in general, untestable and difficult to be certain about. Thus, assessing the sensitivity of the estimate to violations of these assumptions is important and can better inform the causal inferences that can be drawn from the study.

This study was conducted to determine the rate, specific causes, and outcomes of ade-related hospitalization in the usa. We used the healthcare cost and utilization project's nationwide inpatient sample dataset for the years 2008 to 2011. We selected patients with ade based on 537 classification of diseases-9 codes. Main outcome measures included yearly prevalence, cost, length of stay, and mortality of ade-related hospitalizations. Calculations were performed on weighted samples, and statistical significance was set at p-value <0.05 (two-tailed). We estimated the total hospitalizations with ade to be 9 440 757 patients (6.28% of total) from 2008 to 2011. Increasing trend was noted from 2008 (5.97%) to 2011 (6.82%) with an annual percentage change rate of 4.37. Patients with ade were significantly older (2011: mean age 61.42 vs. 48.65 years) and had more comorbidities. Steroids (14.49%), antineoplastic drugs (13.06%), anticoagulants (11.33%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (8.78%), and opiates/narcotics (6.48%) were the five most common causes of ade. Patient with ade stayed 1.89 days [95% confidence interval (ci) (1.79-1.99); p < 0.001] longer, incurred $1851.44 [95%ci ($1613.90-$2088.96), p < 0.001] higher with higher odds of mortality 1.27 [95%ci (1.24-1.29), p < 0.001]. Adverse drug event carries a significant burden of inpatient hospital care, incurs more cost, and leads to increased loss of life. Targeted policies to reduce them could potentially help decrease mortality as well as drive down cost. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28233421

Currently, there are little data on doctors' perceptions of biosimilars and in what situations they are comfortable prescribing biosimilars. In this study, we investigated medical specialists' perceptions of biosimilars and the factors associated with the acceptance of biosimilars. A national sample of 110 of 327 medical specialists working in the areas of rheumatology, dermatology, gastroenterology, oncology and haematology completed an online questionnaire examining attitudes towards prescribing biosimilars, indication extrapolation and switching patients to a biosimilar. Most specialists held positive views of biosimilars, with between 54 and 74% confident in the safety, efficacy, manufacturing and pharmacovigilance of biosimilars. Seventy-one percent of specialists agreed that they would prescribe biosimilars for all or some conditions meeting relevant clinical criteria. Specialists were less confident about indication extrapolation and switching patients from an existing biologic. Acceptance of biosimilars was significantly associated with a lower perceived time to explain a biosimilar to a patient and lower number of weekly patient appointments. The most common situations that they would not prescribe a biosimilar was where there was a lack of clinical data supporting efficacy (32%), or evidence of adverse effects (17%). Medical specialists held generally positive attitudes towards biosimilars but were less confident in indication extrapolation and switching patients from a biologic. Providing clinicians with guidance on how to explain biosimilars to patients and written patient material may help overcome some of the barriers to the use of biosimilars.

We assessed ondansetron and other antiemetic use among pregnant women delivering live births between 2001 and 2015 in 15 data partners contributing data to the mini-sentinel distributed database. We identified live birth pregnancies using a validated algorithm, and all forms of ondansetron and other available antiemetics were identified using national drug codes or procedure codes. We assessed the prevalence of antiemetic use by trimester, calendar year, and formulation. In over 2.3 million pregnancies, the prevalence of ondansetron, promethazine, metoclopramide, or doxylamine/pyridoxine use anytime in pregnancy was 15.2, 10.3, 4.0, and 0.4%, respectively. Ondansetron use increased from <1% of pregnancies in 2001 to 22.2% in 2014, with much of the increase attributable to oral ondansetron beginning in 2006. Promethazine and metoclopramide use increased modestly between 2001 (13.8%, 3.2%) and 2006 (16.0%, 6.0%) but decreased annually through 2014 (8.0%, 3.2%). Doxylamine/pyridoxine, approved for management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in 2013, was used in 1.8% of pregnancies in 2014. For all antiemetics, use was highest in the first trimester. We observed a marked increase in ondansetron use by study year, prescribed to nearly one-quarter of insured pregnant women in 2014, occurring in conjunction with decreased use of promethazine and metoclopramide.

A retrospective cohort study using the general practice research database was carried out. Women aged 10-49 years at pregnancy start who received a prescription for a statin in the 3 months before and/or during the first trimester of pregnancy were matched to up to 10 pregnancies on age at start date, diabetes and hypertension status before pregnancy. Pregnancies occurring between 1/1/1992 and 31/3/2009 were included. Pregnancy losses were identified and categorised as spontaneous (including miscarriage), induced for medical, other or unknown reasons. Freetext was used to determine the type of loss where this was not clear from the coded medical records. Two hundred eighty-one pregnancies potentially exposed to statins were identified and matched to 2643 unexposed pregnancies. About 54.45% of pregnancies potentially exposed to a statin resulted in a delivery compared with 62.81% of those not exposed. 25.27% of all pregnancies potentially exposed to a statin resulted in a spontaneous loss compared with 20.81% in those not exposed. Using a time to event analysis with exposure as a time-dependent covariate gave an adjusted hazards ratio of 1.64 (95%ci 1.10 to 2.46) of spontaneous pregnancy loss in the statin exposed group. This study is the first to report the differences in types of pregnancy loss following the potential exposure to a statin just before or early in pregnancy.

This study analyzed the nonspecific aes occurring with active-drug exposure in rpccts for a large range of medical conditions. Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials published in five prominent medical journals during 2006-2012 were searched. Only trials that evaluated orally or parenterally administered active drugs versus placebo in a head-to-head setting were selected. For aes reported from ≥10 rpccts, pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to determine the relationship between ae rates in placebo and active-drug recipients. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to compute proportions of nonspecific aes, which were truncated at a maximum of 100%, in active-drug recipients. We included 231 trials addressing various medical domains or healthy participants. For the 88 analyzed ae variables, ae rates for placebo and active-drug recipients were in general strongly correlated (r > 0.50) or very strongly correlated (r > 0.80). The pooled proportions of nonspecific aes for the active-drug recipients were 96.8% (95%ci: 95.5-98.1) for any aes, 100% (97.9-100) for serious aes, and 77.7% (72.7-83.2) for drug-related aes. Results were similar for individual medical domains and healthy participants. The pooled proportion of nonspecificity of 82 system organ class and individual ae types ranged from 38% to 100%. The large proportion of nonspecific aes reported in active-drug recipients of rpccts, including serious and drug-related aes, highlights the limitations of clinical trial data to determine the tolerability of drugs.

We linked data on birth characteristics from the medical birth registry of norway (1967-1999) and the norwegian prescription database (2004-2015). Individuals born as singletons during 1974-1984 and alive at the age of 31 were included (main analyses) (n = 450 555). Relative risks (rrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) of using different medications were estimated by log-binomial regression. Population attributable risk and attributable risk percentage (par% and ar%) due to preterm birth were calculated. Individuals born preterm used more specific medications at age 30 than those born at term. The risks of being dispensed psychotropic medications overall and the subgroups antiepileptics, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics were elevated in individuals born preterm. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, the risk was elevated in males born extremely preterm (rr 5.8; 95%ci: 2.2-15). The risk of being dispensed antiasthmatics increased by shorter gestational ages. For psychotropic medications, par% was 0.6% in males and 0.7% in females at age 30; ar% was 13% in males and 17% in females. For antiasthmatics, the corresponding figures were 1.4, 1.1, 24 and 23%. Individuals born preterm used more psychotropic medications overall and antiasthmatics around age 30 than those born at term. The proportions using these medications increased for those born at earlier gestational ages. Those born preterm, especially before 32 weeks of gestation, should be given special attention during early adulthood regarding development of symptoms and signs of certain diseases.

Limited information is available regarding the effect of prenatal exposure to analgesic opioids on long-term neurocognitive function in children. The primary aim of the study was to determine the association between prenatal exposure to analgesic opioids and language competence and communication skills at 3 years of age. The norwegian mother and child cohort study (moba) prospectively included pregnant women during the period from 1999 to 2008. Participants reported medication use at pregnancy weeks 17-18 and 30, and 6 months after birth. Children's language competence and communication skills were reported by mothers on validated scales. A total of 45 211 women with 51 679 singleton pregnancies were included. The use of analgesic opioids was reported in 892 pregnancies (1.7%). In adjusted analyses, no association between opioid use and reduced language competence or communication skills was found, or = 1.04 (95%ci: 0.89-1.22) and or = 1.10 (95%ci: 0.95-1.27), respectively. Both pain and use of paracetamol were associated with a small reduction in communication skills. No such association was found for language competence. The use of analgesic opioids in pregnant women does not seem to affect language development or communication skills in children at 3 years of age. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28168770

Nrtvss requires timely recording of outcomes in the database used. Our main objective was to examine recording delays in the clinical practice research datalink (cprd) for outcomes of interest for vaccine safety to inform the feasibility of nrtvss using these data. We also evaluated completeness of recording and further assessed reporting delays for hospitalized events in cprd. We selected guillain-barré syndrome (gbs), bell's palsy (bp), optic neuritis (on) and febrile seizures (fs), from january 2005 to june 2014. We assessed recording delays (e.g. Due to feedback from specialist referral) in stand-alone cprd by comparing the event and system dates and excluding delays >1 year. We used linked cprd-hospitalization data to further evaluate delays and completeness of recording in cprd. Among 51 220 patients for the stand-alone cprd analysis (gbs: n = 830; bp: n = 12 602; on: n = 1720; and fs: n = 36 236), most had a record entered within 1 month of the event date (gbs: 73.6%; bp: 93.4%; on: 76.2%; and fs: 85.6%). A total of 13 482 patients, with a first record in hospital, were included for the analysis of linked data (gbs: n = 678; bp: n = 4060; on: n = 485; and fs: n = 8321). Of these, <50% had a record in cprd after 1 year (gbs: 41.3%; bp: 22.1%; on: 22.4%; and fs: 41.8%). This work shows that most diagnoses in cprd for the conditions examined were recorded with delays of ≤30 days, making nrtvss possible. The pattern of delays was condition-specific and could be used to adjust for delays in the nrtvss analysis. Despite low sensitivity of recording, implementing nrtvss in cprd is worthwhile and could be carried out, at least on a trial basis, for events of interest. © 2017 the authors.

New users of cilostazol were identified in populations enrolled in five european health automated databases in the uk (the health improvement network [thin]), spain (epichron cohort and information system for the improvement of research in primary care [sidiap]), sweden (national registers), and germany (german pharmacoepidemiological research database [gepard]) between 2002 and 2012. New users were characterized according to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities, concurrent use of interacting medications, new contraindications, duration of use, and potential off-label prescribing. We identified 22 593 new users of cilostazol. The median age was between 68.0 (thin) and 73.7 (sweden) years. More than 78% of users had concomitant cardiovascular disease, and between 78.8% (gepard) and 91.6% (thin) were treated with interacting medications. Prevalence of new cardiovascular contraindications ranged from 1.5% (thin) to 11.6% (gepard), and concurrent use of two or more antiplatelet drugs ranged from 6.3% (sidiap) to 13.5% (epichron cohort). Between 39.4% (sweden) and 52.9% (thin) of users discontinued cilostazol in the first 3 months. Between 41.0% (sidiap) and 93.4% (thin) were considered to have received cilostazol according to the european medicines agency labeling. In this collaborative european study, most cilostazol users were elderly patients with a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and other comorbidity and concurrent use of interacting drugs, indicating that this is a vulnerable population at high risk of complications, especially cardiovascular events. © 2017 the authors.

The objective of this study was to compare the long-term effectiveness of the recommended therapeutic combination with those of incomplete combinations in secondary prevention of acs. This cohort study used data from a representative sample of the french national healthcare insurance system database. Patients hospitalised for an incident acs between 2006 and 2011 and aged ≥20 years at the time of acs were included in the study. Effectiveness in preventing the composite outcome acs, transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke or all-cause-death was estimated using time-fixed and time-dependent cox proportional hazards models with different definitions of exposure (at inclusion or determined daily during follow-up) and adjustment for patient characteristics, co-morbidities and co-medications. Of the 2874 patients included in the study, 33.9% were women; median age was 67 years (interquartile range: 56-77). The median duration of follow-up was 3.6 years (interquartile range: 2.2-5.3). Compared with the use of recommended combination, use of combination with three classes increased the risk of the composite outcome from 1.25 (95% confidence interval (95%ci), [1.07-1.47]) in the time-fixed model and from 1.40 (95%ci, [1.15-1.70]) or 1.42 (95%ci, [1.13-1.79]) in the time-dependent models. After acs, the use of incomplete drugs combinations compared with the recommended four drugs combination was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality.

A retrospective cohort study has been used linking pharmetrics, a commercial claims database, to a prescription database (lrx) that captures pharmacy dispensings independently of payment method, including cash transactions. We included adults with dispensings for opioids, diuretics, antiplatelet medications, or anticoagulants. To determine the degree of capture of dispensings, we calculated the number of subjects with the following: (1) same number of dispensings in both databases; (2) at least one dispensing, but not all dispensings, missed in pharmetrics; and (3) all dispensings missing in pharmetrics. Similar analyses were conducted using dispensings as the unit of analysis. To assess whether a dispensing in lrx was in pharmetrics, the dispensing in pharmetrics had to be for the same medication class and within ±7 days in lrx. A total of 1 426 498 subjects were included. Overall, 68% of subjects had the same number of dispensings in both databases. In 13% of subjects, pharmetrics identified ≥1 dispensing but also missed ≥1 dispensing. In 19% of the subjects, pharmetrics missed all the dispensings. Taking dispensings as the unit of analysis, 25% of the dispensings present in lrx were not captured in pharmetrics. These patterns were similar across all four classes of medications. Of the dispensings missing in pharmetrics, 48% involved a subject who had >1 health insurance plan. Commercial claims databases provide an incomplete picture of all prescriptions dispensed to patients. The lack of capture goes beyond cash transactions and potentially introduces substantial misclassification bias. © 2017 the authors.

Atherosclerosis risk in communities participants with ≥3 years of continuous fee-for-service medicare enrollment from 2000 to 2012 was assigned an index date 36 months after enrollment separating the time-in-observation period into the look-back and the incidence periods. Incident hf events were identified using icd-9-cm code algorithms as the first observed hospitalization claim or the second of two hf outpatient claims occurring within 12 months. Using 36 months as a referent, the look-back period was reduced by 6-month increments. For each look-back period, we calculated the incidence rate, percent of prevalent hf events misclassified as incident, and loss in sample size. We identified 9568 atherosclerosis risk in communities participants at risk for hf. For hospitalized and outpatient hf, the number of events misclassified as incident increased, and the total number of incident events decreased with increased length of the look-back period. The incident rate (per 1000 person years) decreased with increased length of the look-back period from 6 to 36 months and had a greater impact on outpatient hf; for example, from 11.2 to 10.6 for icd-9-cm 428.xx hospitalization in the primary position and 10.5 to 7.9 for outpatient hf. Our estimates can be used to optimize trade-offs between the degree of misclassification and number of events in the estimation of incident hf from administrative claims data, as pertinent to different study questions.

Descriptive, cross-sectional study, utilising a 7-day medication diary. Community-based treatment settings, australia. A sample of 1101 people prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Opioid dose data was collected via a self-completed 7-day medication diary capturing names, strengths and doses of each medication taken in the past week. Median daily dose was calculated for each opioid. Comparisons were made to the world health organization's (who) ddd metric. Who ddds ranged from 0.6 to 7.1 times the median opioid doses used by the sample. For transdermal fentanyl and oral hydromorphone, the median dose was comparable with the ddd. The ddd for methadone was 0.6 times lower than the median doses used by this sample of chronic pain patients. In contrast, the ddd for oxycodone and transdermal buprenorphine, the most commonly used strong opioids for chronic pain in australia, was two to seven times higher than actual doses used. For many opioids, there are key differences between the actual doses used in clinical practice and the who's ddds. The interpretation of opioid utilisation studies using population-level ddds may be limited, and a recalibration of the ddd for many opioids or the reporting of opioid utilisation in oral morphine equivalent doses is recommended.

We designed a cohort study using a pharmacy prescription database. Pregnant women were considered exposed when they received a prescription of ri-inducing drugs. These drugs could be either used alone (ri+/faa-) or combined with drugs exhibiting folic acid antagonism (faa, ri+/faa+). The reference group included pregnant women who did not receive any ri-inducing drugs or faa drugs. We analyzed 4116 exposed and 30 422 reference pregnancies. The hazard ratio (hr) with 95% confidence interval (ci) was 1.27 (95%ci 1.15-1.41) for pregnancies exposed to ri-inducing drugs as a whole. Considering subgroups of ri-inducing drugs, prenatal exposure to both ri+/faa+ and ri+/faa- was associated with the children's initiation of psychotropic medications, hrs being 1.35 (95%ci 1.10-1.66) and 1.26 (1.13-1.41), respectively. The hrs were increased with prolonged exposure to ri-inducing drugs, especially in the first and second trimesters. In a detailed examination of the psychotropics, the incidences of receiving antimigraine preparations and psychostimulants were significantly increased for the exposed children, compared with the reference children. The incidences of receiving antipsychotics and hypnotics were also higher for the exposed children; however, the hrs did not reach significance after adjustment. We found a significantly increased incident use of psychotropic medications among children prenatally exposed to ri-inducing drugs, especially during the first and second trimesters. This suggests a detrimental effect during critical periods of brain development. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28097730

Patients' serum paracetamol results over 14 years (2000-2013) from 20 (out of 21) regions in sweden were linked to national registers of hospital care, cause of death, and prescriptions. Paracetamol poisonings were defined by serum paracetamol levels, hospital diagnoses, or cause of death. The change in incidence of poisonings following increased availability of paracetamol was analysed by using segmental regression of time series. Of the 12 068 paracetamol poisonings, 85% were classified as intentional self-harm. Following increased availability from non-pharmacy outlets, there was a 40.5% increase in the incidence of paracetamol poisoning, from 11.5/100 000 in 2009 to 16.2/100 000 in 2013. Regression analyses indicated a change in the trend (p < 0.0001) but not an immediate jump in the incidence (p = 0.5991) following the increased availability. Adjusting for trends in hospital episodes for self-harm, suicides, and the sales volume of paracetamol did not influence the result. All-cause mortality at 30 days (3.2%) did not change over time. The incidence of paracetamol poisoning in sweden has increased since 2009, contrasting the decreased incidence in the period of 2007-2009. The change in trend was temporally associated with the introduction of availability of paracetamol from non-pharmacy outlets but did not appear to be related to sales volume of paracetamol or general trends in self-harm or suicides. © 2017 commonwealth of australia.

Professional and consumer product labeling for five adhd medications approved in australia, canada, the uk, and the usa were obtained in march/april 2016. Language describing the relationship between medication and elevated blood pressure and/or heart rate, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death was extracted verbatim and classified into one of four categories based on the described relationship between medication and adverse event: ""confirmed,"" ""unconfirmed,"" ""mixed,"" and ""not mentioned."" we judged the consistency of messages delivered to healthcare professionals and consumers as either ""consistent"" or ""inconsistent."" we obtained 20 healthcare professional labels and 20 corresponding consumer labels for the five adhd medications registered in all four countries. Not all professional and consumer labeling contained language regarding all four adverse events. Of the 80 theoretically evaluable drug-risk pairs, 38 (48%) were not evaluable because of absence of mention of the adverse event in the consumer label. For the remaining 42, the potential causal relationship was expressed consistently in professional and consumer labeling in 25 (60%) cases. The cardiovascular risk profile was not described consistently across all four countries for any of the five drugs.

We aimed to investigate risk factors of paracetamol- and propacetamol-associated adverse drug reactions (adrs) in korean individuals. All adverse hypotension cases, regardless of suspected drug, and all adrs associated with paracetamol and propacetamol use were collected from the korea adverse event reporting system database between 2011 and 2014. The seriousness, causality, and type of adr were classified. Of 4,771 cases of adverse hypotension, 403 (8.4%) were reported to be related to propacetamol. This was comparable to the rate of hypotension associated with fentanyl (454, 9.5%), the major suspected drug of hypotension. Paracetamol-associated hypotension accounted for merely 1.2% (55 cases) of all hypotension cases. Among adrs associated with propacetamol use, hypotension was the most common (37.1%), whereas cutaneous reactions were the primary paracetamol-associated adr. Propacetamol/paracetamol-associated hypotension was frequently recorded in older patients (≥54 years) (53.9 ± 25.8 vs. 42.8 ± 21.7, p < 0.001) and taking more concomitant drugs (1.9 ± 5.0 vs. 1.1 ± 3.2, p < 0.001). Also, compared with other adrs associated by propacetamol/paracetamol, hypotension was more commonly assessed as a serious outcome (27.3% vs. 11.4%, p < 0.001). Regarding concomitant medications, the risk for hypotension associated with propacetamol was significantly increased in patients simultaneously taking antibacterials (j01), cold preparations (r05), drugs for acid related disorders (a02), blood substitutes (b05), or antithrombotics (b01). Propacetamol was found to be a major suspected drug of pharmacologically associated hypotension in korea. Older and male patients taking medications in combination with propacetamol/paracetamol should undergo monitoring of their blood pressure. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28083935

A population-based case-control study.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4156,"Drug-induced agranulocytosis is a rare but life-threatening adverse drug reaction. Its epidemiology in chinese is largely unknown. This study aimed to estimate the incidence, mortality, and risk of the drugs associated with agranulocytosis in hong kong chinese. A population-based case-control study was conducted using the clinical data analysis and reporting system, a database managed by the hong kong hospital authority. Patients with drug-induced agranulocytosis from 1 january 2004 to 31 december 2013 were identified. World health organization causality assessment was used to evaluate the possible drug aetiology of each case. Odd ratios (ors) of the drug exposure were calculated using exact conditional logistic regression. A total of 155 cases of drug-induced agranulocytosis were identified. Mean age was 51.4 years, and 95 cases were female. Incidence rate was estimated to be 2.2 cases per million person-years, and the all-cause mortality of patients with drug-induced agranulocytosis was 3.9%. Among the cases, the most common associated drug groups were antithyroid drugs (41.9%), antimicrobials (20%), anticonvulsants (10.3%), and antipsychotics (6.5%). Carbimazole had the highest risk of agranulocytosis (adjusted or 416.7, 95% confidence interval (ci) 51.5-3372.9) with an incidence of 9.2 (95%ci 6.9-12.1) per 10 000 users and 3.6 (95%ci 2.7-4.8) per 10 000 user-years. Other drugs with significant risk included cephalosporins, clozapine, penicillins, phenytoin, and propyl thiouracil. The incidence and mortality in hong kong chinese were relatively low compared to caucasians. Antithyroid drugs were the most common implicated drug class, and carbimazole had the highest risk of agranulocytosis. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28083886

Data were obtained from kaiser permanente northwest and northern california. Diagnostic data from electronic health records, submitted claims, and state death records from oregon, washington, and california were linked. Individual opioid-related poisoning codes (e.g., 965.xx and x42), and adverse effects of opioids codes (e.g., e935.xx) combined with diagnoses possibly indicative of overdoses (e.g., respiratory depression), were evaluated by comparison with chart audits. Opioid adverse effects codes had low ppv to detect overdoses (13.4%) as assessed in 127 charts and were not pursued. Instead, opioid poisoning codes were assessed in 2100 individuals who had those codes present in electronic health records in the period between the years 2008 and 2012. Of these, 10/2100 had no available information and 241/2100 were excluded potentially as anesthesia-related. Among the 1849 remaining individuals with opioid poisoning codes, 1495 events were accurately identified as opioid overdoses; 69 were miscodes or misidentified, and 285 were opioid adverse effects, not overdoses. Thus, ppv was 81%. Opioid adverse effects or overdoses were accurately identified in 1780 of 1849 events (96.3%). Opioid poisoning codes have a predictive value of 81% to identify opioid overdoses, suggesting icd opioid poisoning codes can be used to monitor overdose rates and evaluate interventions to reduce overdose. Further research to assess sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value are ongoing. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28074520

Individual case safety reports (icsrs) reported by healthcare professionals to the national pharmacovigilance database 2008-2011 were related to defined daily dose (ddd) in the swedish prescribed drug register (spdr) for individual's ≥20 years. Data were stratified into five age groups. Crude and adjusted (by age standardisation of prescribed drugs) reporting rate (rr) and reporting rate ratio was evaluated as well as impact of sex-dependent drugs. Based on 9898 included icsrs, the crude results show that overall rr was almost similar for both serious and non-serious reports and indicates highest rr in the youngest age group. Women had higher rates than men, with predominance for non-serious reports, contrary to men who had a higher rr of serious ones. Standardisation led partly to the same result, but age-related distribution was adjusted, with highest overall rr in the oldest age groups. Sex-dependent drugs had marginal impact on the results. Age and sex have impact on spontaneous reporting of adrs. After adjusting for dispensed drugs and by standardisation of age-related differences in prescribed drugs, results indicate that healthcare professionals more frequently reported adrs for the oldest individuals and for women. Serious reports were more frequently reported for men. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28071845

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of concomitant use of ccbs and clopidogrel on risks of acute coronary syndrome (acs) re-hospitalization in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention. Using the taiwan national health insurance research database, we identified 51 925 patients who were admitted for newly diagnosed acs, received percutaneous coronary intervention, and used clopidogrel within 1 year after discharge. We further stratified them into three groups based on their uses of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications for acs (fully, partially, and non-compliant groups) to assess the potential modification effect of guideline compliance. For each group, we conducted a 1:1 propensity score matching to minimize selection bias. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the effect of concomitant use of ccbs (overall, subclasses, and individual ccbs) and clopidogrel on risks of acs re-hospitalization. Concomitant use of ccbs in patients discharged with clopidogrel was significantly associated with a lower risk of acs re-hospitalization in the fully compliant group (hr   = 0.82 [95% confidence interval 0.75-0.89], p < 0.001) but was associated with increased risk of acs re-hospitalization in the non-compliant group (hr   = 1.22 [1.03-1.45], p = 0.0252). Different guideline compliance of secondary prevention medications could modify the potential drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and ccbs. Concomitant use of ccbs and clopidogrel was significantly associated with increased risk of acs re-hospitalization in acs patients not compliant to guideline-recommended secondary prevention drugs.

We estimated prevalence for selected defects by vsd site and birth year and compared these estimates to those in a us and european surveillance system. We developed algorithms to enumerate >50 major structural birth defects from standardized administrative and healthcare data based on utilization patterns and expert opinion, applying criteria for number, timing, and setting of diagnoses. Our birth cohort included 497 894 infants across seven sites. The period prevalence for all selected major birth defects in the vsd from 2004 to 2013 was 1.7 per 100 live births. Cardiac defects were most common (65.4 per 10 000 live births), with one-fourth classified as severe, requiring emergent intervention. For most major structural birth defects, prevalence estimates were stable over time and across sites and similar to those reported in other population-based surveillance systems. Our algorithms can efficiently identify many major structural birth defects in large healthcare datasets and can be used in studies evaluating the safety of vaccines administered to pregnant women.

The present case-control study explores the impact of underlying indications on this potential association. Physicians collected the medical history; prior 12-month drug use was obtained from standardized telephone interviews with patients. The association between aed use and sa was explored using multivariate conditional logistic regression. The analyses were replicated after stratification on depression and neurological disorders (epilepsy, migraine, and chronic neuropathic pain). Between 2008 and 2012, 506 adults with an incident sa were recruited in suicide treatment centers from across france and socio-demographically matched to 2829 controls from primary care settings. The association between aed use and odds of sa was not significant overall (odds ratio [or], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.9-2.4). No association was observed for patients with neurological disorders (or, 1.1; 95%ci, 0.5-2.4) as opposed to patients with depression (or, 1.6; 95%ci, 1.0-2.5), but unmeasured confounding was suspected. Our results suggest that the association observed between aed use and increased odds of non-fatal sa in patients with either a lifetime history of depression or no neurological disorder may be explained by the presence of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Accounting for underlying indications is crucial in drug safety studies, as these can cause a reported association (or lack thereof) to be misleading. This may require the prospective collection of medical data at a patient level. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.",28052554

We performed natural language processing (nlp) of 743 838 operative notes recorded for 315 246 surgeries to ascertain two variables needed to study the comparative effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in cataract surgery. The first key variable was an exposure variable, intracameral antibiotic injection. The second was an intraoperative complication, posterior capsular rupture (pcr), which functioned as a potential confounder. To help other researchers use nlp in their settings, we describe our nlp protocol and lessons learned. For each of the two variables, we used sas text miner and other sas text-processing modules with a training set of 10 000 (1.3%) operative notes to develop a lexicon. The lexica identified misspellings, abbreviations, and negations, and linked words into concepts (e.g. ""antibiotic"" linked with ""injection""). We confirmed the nlp tools by iteratively obtaining random samples of 2000 (0.3%) notes, with replacement. The nlp tools identified approximately 60 000 intracameral antibiotic injections and 3500 cases of pcr. The positive and negative predictive values for intracameral antibiotic injection exceeded 99%. For the intraoperative complication, they exceeded 94%. Nlp was a valid and feasible method for obtaining critical variables needed for a research study of surgical safety. These nlp tools were intended for use in the study sample. Use with external datasets or future datasets in our own setting would require further testing.

U.s. Pregnancy exposure registries designed to evaluate safety of drugs or biologics were identified from www.clinicaltrials.gov, the fda's office of women's health website, and the fda's list of postmarketing studies. Protocols or similar documentation were obtained. We identified 35 u.s. Registries for drugs or biologic use during pregnancy. All registries assessed risk for overall major congenital malformations. Pre-specified target enrollment was stated for 18 (51%) registries, and ranged from 150 to 500 exposed pregnancies (median 300). Thirty-two (91%) registries identified at least one comparison group, but only nine (26%) planned to use an internal comparator. The most common external comparator group (n = 24, 69%) was the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program (macdp). No registries were designed to have sufficient power to assess specific malformations, despite the plausibility that most teratogens cause specific defects. Only half of the registries included a power analysis. Despite their common use, external comparators, including macdp, have important limitations. In the absence of randomized controlled trial data in pregnant women, pregnancy registries remain an important tool as part of a comprehensive pregnancy surveillance program; however, pregnancy registries alone may not be sufficient to obtain adequate data regarding risks of specific malformations.

However, the reduction in adverse events and costs associated with lower disease activity is unclear. We used corrona linked to medicare data to identify ra patients. Time varying disease activity was measured using clinical disease activity index (cdai); outcomes included all-cause hospitalization, a composite of hospitalization or emergency department (ed) visits, mortality, and medical costs. Outcome-specific cox proportional models evaluated the adjusted hazard ratios between disease activity and outcomes, controlling for potential confounders including comorbidities grouped into four patient phenotypes. Costs were analyzed with mixed models using a gaussian distribution with log transformation. Depending on outcome, 4593 ra patients contributed up to 12 001 person years. Median age was 71 years, 75% women. At baseline, approximately 50-60% of patients were in remission or low disease activity. There was a dose-response relationship between ra disease activity (remission, low, moderate, and high) and the incidence of hospitalizations (13.1, 17.8, 21.2, 27.5 per 100 py, respectively); all adjusted hazard ratios were significant: 0.68 (remission), 0.87 (low), and 1.24 (high) compared with moderate disease activity. Similar trends were observed for ed visits and mortality. The crude difference in annual medical costs between remission ($11 145) and moderate disease activity ($17 646) was $-6 500; the adjusted difference (95%ci) was $-3133 (-4737.72, -1528.43). Leveraging the benefits of linking registry and administrative data together, lower disease activity in ra was associated with incrementally reduced risks of all-cause hospitalization, ed visits, mortality, and medical costs in a dose-dependent fashion.

To address this question, we explored the feasibility of conducting an observational study using multiple us health care data sources. Retrospective cohort study to evaluate the likelihood of getting an upper 95% confidence limit ≤1.4 for the asthma mortality rate ratio and ≤0.40 per 10 000 person-years for the mortality rate difference, assuming no effect of new use of combined laba + ics (versus non-laba maintenance therapy) on asthma mortality. Ten research institutions executed centrally distributed analytic code based on a standard protocol using an extracted (2000-2010) persistent asthma cohort (asthma diagnosis and ≥4 asthma medications in 12 months). Pooled results were analyzed by the coordinating center. Asthma deaths were ascertained by linkage with the national death index. In a cohort of 994 627 persistent asthma patients (2.4 million person-years; 278 asthma deaths), probabilities of the upper 95% confidence limit for effect estimates being less than targeted values, assuming a null relation, were about 0.05. Modifications in cohort and exposure definitions increased exposed person-time and outcome events, but study size remained insufficient to attain study goals. Even with 10 data sources and a 10-year study period, the rarity of asthma deaths among patients using certain medications made it infeasible to study the association between combined laba + ics and asthma mortality with our targeted level of study precision.

The objective of this investigation is to assess consistency in the relative abuse ratios (rars) across different approaches for adjusting for drug availability. For the years 2004 through 2010, rars for each of four prescription opioids (hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, and morphine) were calculated using negative binomial regression. Measures of abuse (outcome) were misuse/abuse-related emergency department visits obtained from the drug abuse warning network. Measures of drug availability (offsets) were drug utilization estimates obtained from ims health. Separate regression models were run using each of five measures of drug utilization: unique patients (urdd), prescriptions dispensed (rx), tablets dispensed (td), kilograms (kgs) sold, and morphine-equivalents (mes) of kilograms sold. These results were compared for consistency. Aside from oxycodone-combination products, across molecules, rars adjusted by rxs, tds, and urdds were generally similar to each other while rars adjusted by kgs and mes were different. For example, compared to hydrocodone, oxycodone had statistically significantly increased rars of 3.6 (95%ci: 2.0-6.5), 3.5 (95%ci: 1.9-6.4), and 2.7 (95%ci: 1.5-5.0) when adjusted by urdds, rxs, and tds, respectively, but not when adjusted by kgs or mes.

The evaluable study cohort (n = 2748) was derived from the database of the largest health insurance provider in the slovak republic. Patients aged ≥65 years who were initiated on statin therapy following the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke during one full year (1 january 2010 to 31 december 2010) constituted this cohort. Each patient was followed for a period of 3 years from the date of the first statin prescription. Patients with a continuous treatment gap of 6 months without statin prescription were designated as non-persistent. The cox proportional hazard model was applied to determine patient-associated characteristics that influenced the likelihood of non-persistence. During the 3-year follow-up period, 39.7% of patients in the study cohort became non-persistent. Factors associated with decreased probability of a patient becoming non-persistent were age ≥75 years (hazard ratio (hr) 0.75), polypharmacy (concurrent use of ≥6 drugs) (hr 0.79), diabetes mellitus (hr 0.80), dementia (hr 0.81) and hypercholesterolemia (hr 0.50). On the other hand, the presence of anxiety disorders (hr 1.33) predicted an increased likelihood of a patient being non-persistent. Our findings suggest that patients aged ≥75 years or those with the presence of diabetes mellitus, dementia, hypercholesterolemia or polypharmacy were likely to be persistent with statin therapy, whereas those with anxiety disorders may need greater assistance with persistence of statin therapy.

Patients aged ≥70 years were included from three cross-sectional studies conducted in 1997, 2005 and 2011. Pims were analyzed according to the norwegian general practice-nursing home criteria (norgep-nh), use of single substances to avoid, combinations to avoid, and deprescribing items. Associations between sample and use of pims were examined by logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, and ward. We established pearsons r for correlations between numbers of drugs and pims. Altogether, 4373 patients (mean age 85.7 years, 73.5% women) were included. The mean overall number of drugs per patient increased from 4.7 in 1997 to 6.9 in 2011 (p < 0.001). Use of any single substances to avoid increased from 36.8% in 1997 to 39.5% in 2011 (p = 0.002), use of any combinations to avoid from 16.3% to 27.0% (p < 0.001), and use of any deprescribing items from 46.0% to 55.3% (p < 0.001). Use of codeine-analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, long-acting benzodiazepines, and first generation antihistamines decreased significantly, while use of short-acting benzodiazepines, z-hypnotics, statins, and anti-dementia drugs increased significantly. A moderate strong correlation was detected between number of drugs and the three above-mentioned pim categories, r = 0.34, r = 0.43, r = 0.37, respectively (all p < 0.001). Although several pims were less commonly prescribed in recent years, increased overall use of pims may suggests worsening of prescribing quality for nursing home patients in norway.

Our aim was to compare mortality in uk primary care patients who discontinue asa after ugib with that in patients who continue therapy. Asa users at the time of ugib and who were alive 30 days after were selected using the health improvement network. Predictors of survival were assessed using adjusted cox proportional hazards regression models. Of 547 asa users, half did not re-initiate asa during a mean follow-up of 4.1 years. Increasing age (a 10% increased risk for each yearly increase in age; hazard ratio [hr]: 1.10; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.07-1.14), female sex (hr: 1.61; 95%ci: 1.09-2.38), current smoking (hr: 2.11; 95%ci: 1.23-3.63), heavy alcohol use (hr: 3.31; 95%ci: 1.50-7.31), diabetes mellitus (hr: 1.93; 95%ci: 1.25-3.00), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hr: 1.75; 95%ci: 1.03-2.99) were significantly associated with increased mortality. Most deaths (115/139) occurred in patients taking asa for secondary prevention. In these patients, mortality tended to be lower among asa continuer periods (hr: 0.74; 95%ci: 0.34-1.62) and higher among discontinuer periods (hr: 1.37; 95%ci: 0.81-2.30) than among non-users. Current use of clopidogrel was associated with decreased mortality in this population (hr: 0.49; 95%ci: 0.28-0.86). Asa therapy for secondary prevention should continue after ugib because the risk of death tends to increase when asa is stopped. However, a significantly increased risk was not found in these patients, likely owing to the relatively small number of asa users and deaths that occurred during follow-up. Further studies with larger samples sizes are needed to confirm these findings among ugib survivors taking asa at the time of ugib. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27921360

Octreotide is used off-label in children <6 years of age for hyperinsulinism, chylothorax, and gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a lack of controlled data on efficacy or potential adverse events from this off-label use. Three pediatric hospitals participated in this study. Patients were hospitalized january 2007-december 2010 and administered octreotide for congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) at least 1 day. Variables assessed included octreotide dosage, patient demographics, medical interventions, concomitant medicines, serious adverse events (saes) including necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), and mortality. The 103 patient sample had a median gestational age of 38 weeks. During the study period, two patients died: one from nec and the other from cardiomyopathy/sepsis. There were 11 other saes in the 101 surviving patients. This study highlights potential risks in administering octreotide off-label. This study, like several other published studies, has highlighted nec in a full-term infant treated with octreotide. It is important to study the efficacy and the safety of octreotide for hyperinsulinism. In the interim, it might be prudent to prescribe octreotide in chi neonates only in the absence of other risk factors for nec. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27910218

We sought to modify two pharmacy-based comorbidity measures and compare their performance in predicting hospitalization and/or death. The reference was a diagnosis-based score. One of the two measures applied an updated approach linking specific atc codes of dispensed drugs to 22 ccs; the other used a list of 37 drug categories, without linking them to specific ccs. Using logistic regressions that took repeated measures into account and hospitalization and/or death the following year as the outcome, we assigned weights to each cc/drug category. Comorbidity scores were calculated as the weighted sum of the 22 ccs/37 drug categories. We compared the performance of both measures in predicting hospitalization and/or death with that of a diagnosis-based score based on 30 groups of long-term illnesses (ltis), a status granted in france to exempt beneficiaries with chronic diseases from copayments. We assessed the predictive performance of the scores with the quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion (qic), the c statistic and the brier score. The two pharmacy-based scores performed better than the lti score, with lower qic and brier scores and higher c statistics. Their predictive performance was very similar. While there is no clear consensus or recommendations about the optimal choice of comorbidity measure, both pharmacy-based scores may be useful for limiting confounding in observational studies among general populations of adults from health insurance databases.

We conducted an investigation of vaccination and sudden unexplained infant death (suid) and repeated it more recently after taiwan switched to acellular pertussis vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis [dtap]) in 2010. All suids aged 31-364 days during 1990-1992 and 1996-2013 were selected from the death registration databases. The case-control investigation matched each case to two controls on clinic, sex, and birth date, whereas the follow-up self-controlled case series study compared risk of death during the 30-day post-vaccination risk periods with those in the control periods within the same case. Sudden unexplained infant death was associated with never receiving dtwp (odds ratio 2.28, 95% confidence interval 1.25-4.15) in the case-control investigation. The odds ratios within 0-1, 2-7, 8-14, and 15-30 days of dtwp administration were 1.18, 0.26, 0.50, and 0.77. In the 1996-2013 self-controlled case series studies, this temporal shift between dtwp and suid was consistently observed for female (incidence rate ratio 1.70, 0.75, 1.01, and 0.84) but not male or dtap recipients. A pooled analysis showed significant risk within 2 days of receiving dtwp in female infants (incidence rate ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.60). Being unvaccinated and recent receipt of dtwp in female infants was significantly associated with suid; the latter was consistent with a temporal shift pattern without overall increase in risk. The currently used pertussis vaccine, dtap, did not increase risk of suid. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27891698
1159,Pottegård A;Hallas J,2017,New use of prescription drugs prior to a cancer diagnosis.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4145,"Cancers often have considerable induction periods. This confers a risk of reverse causation bias in studies of cancer risk associated with drug use, as early symptoms of a yet undiagnosed cancer might lead to drug treatment in the period leading up to the diagnosis. This bias can be alleviated by disregarding exposure for some time before the cancer diagnosis (lag time). We aimed at assessing the duration of lag time needed to avoid reverse causation bias. We identified all danish patients with incident cancer between 2000 and 2012 (n = 353 087). Incident use of prescription drugs was assessed prior to their cancer diagnosis as well as among population controls (n = 1 402 400). Analyses were conducted for all cancers and for breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer individually. Further, analyses were performed for a composite measure of all incident drug use as well as for nine pre-specified individual drug classes, representing drug treatment likely to be prescribed for symptoms of the given cancers. The incidence rate for new drug treatment among cancer cases was stable around 130 per 1000 persons per month until 6 months prior to cancer diagnosis where it increased gradually and peaked at 434 in the month immediately preceding the cancer diagnosis. Considerable variation was observed among cancers, for example, breast cancer showed almost no such effect. The pre-selected drug classes showed a stronger increase prior to cancer diagnoses than drugs overall. Incident use of drugs increases in the months prior to a cancer diagnosis. To avoid reverse causation, 6 months' lag time would be sufficient for most drug-cancer associations. © 2016 the authors.

The aim of this literature review is to provide an overview of criteria used for signal prioritization and of the associated decision support frameworks. A search strategy was constructed to identify relevant articles in medline/embase databases from the period from 1 january 1995 to 31 august 2015. The prioritization criteria were extracted and classified in relevant categories. From an initial set of 63 articles, 11 were retained for full review. The articles mentioned 48 criteria used in the prioritization process, with a median of six criteria per study [range: 1-16]. More than half of the criteria (63%), referred to strength of evidence while 19% related to public health impact, 14% to general public and media attention and 4% to novelty of the drug event association. Fifteen criteria were tested for predictive value with 11 showing positive results, most of them from the strength of evidence category. Six decision-making frameworks are presented, which incorporate criteria from various categories. Five of these frameworks were tested against expert decisions or by other means, but only in one database each and for a limited set of products. There is a wide range of prioritization criteria described in the literature; however, few of them demonstrated predictive value. Many criteria with predictive value were related to strength of evidence category and to novelty. There were few attempts at integrating different criteria in decision support frameworks. Five of the frameworks were tested for validity and showed usefulness, while at least three are already in use for prioritization. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27878889

Deafness, tinnitus and vertigo were reported in 576 drug-adr pairs (cases), the rest being other adrs (non-cases). Reporting of deafness was most disproportionately associated with amikacin use (ror 9.3; 95%ci 3.8-23.0), followed by kanamycin use (ror 4.3; 95%ci 1.3-14.2). Reporting of vertigo was inversely associated with capreomycin use (ror 0.1; 95%ci 0.01-0.4). Geographic region affected the reporting of ototoxicity while age and sex did not. Spontaneous reporting of deafness cases within vigibase® was most disproportionately associated with amikacin use, followed by kanamycin. There were regional variations in the global reporting of ototoxicity. These findings should be verified through a follow up study. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27868278

Beyond that, little is known about the short treatment durations that have been observed for many young antidepressant users. The present study examined antidepressant use in pediatric patients aged 0 to 17 years over time, investigated changes regarding the prescribed drugs, analyzed underlying diagnoses, and assessed the rate of off-label use. We used claims data of roughly two million individuals to calculate annual prevalence and incidence rates of antidepressant prescriptions for the years 2004 to 2011. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, and drug type. For antidepressant users, numbers of prescriptions, frequencies of disorders/diseases, and specialties of the prescribing physicians were examined. The share of off-label prescriptions was calculated for each year. The prescription prevalence of antidepressants ranged between 1.7 and 2.1 per 1000 minors. The use of tricyclic antidepressants decreased from 0.9 to 0.6 prescriptions per 1000 minors, while the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increased from 0.5 to 1.1. Of the patients with an antidepressant prescription, 46.4% only received one prescription. Depression was by far the most frequent diagnosis among all antidepressant users as well as among subjects with only one prescription. In 2011, 36.3% of all prescriptions were off-label. The high proportion of single prescriptions, even in patients with a diagnosed depression, and the high rate of off-label use are particularly noteworthy and should be further investigated in future studies.

We used a population-based retrospective cohort study. Information emerges from sidiap, a database containing anonymized information from electronic health records from 274 primary healthcare centres of the catalan health institute, catalonia (spain), with a reference population of 5 835 000 people. Population includes all adults with a new diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation registered in sidiap from 2007 to 2012. The main outcome of antithrombotics' effectiveness was stroke. The main outcomes of safety were cerebral and gastrointestinal haemorrhages. We also estimated all-cause mortality. We used multivariable cox proportional hazard models to examine association between antithrombotic treatment and main outcomes. We included 22 205 subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation; 40.8% initiated on vitamin k antagonists (vka), 33.4% on antiplatelets and 25.8% untreated. We found stroke-risk reduction with vka, hazard ratio (hr) 0.72 (95% confidence interval (ci), 0.58-0.91), also seen in patients with chads   ≥ 2, hr 0.65 (95%ci, 0.49-0.86), and cha  ds  -vasc ≥ 2, hr 0.66 (95%ci, 0.52-0.84). We observed a higher risk of digestive bleeding with antiplatelets, hr 1.32 (95%ci, 1.01-1.73). Both vka and antiplatelets were associated with reduction of all-cause mortality risk; hr 0.55 (95%ci, 0.49-0.62) and hr 0.89 (95%ci, 0.80-0.97), respectively. This study found a stroke-risk reduction associated with vka and an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with platelet-aggregation inhibitors in comparison with untreated patients. Both antithrombotic groups showed a reduction in all-cause mortality. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27868275

We applied functional data analysis, a statistical framework developed for analysing curve data, to investigate weekly temporal patterns in wastewater measurements of three prescription drugs with known abuse potential: methadone, oxazepam and methylphenidate, comparing them to positive and negative control drugs. Sewage samples were collected in february 2014 from a wastewater treatment plant in oslo, norway. The weekly pattern of each drug was extracted by fitting of generalized additive models, using trigonometric functions to model the cyclic behaviour. From the weekly component, the main temporal features were then extracted using functional principal component analysis. Results are presented through the functional principal components (fpcs) and corresponding fpc scores. Clinically, the most important weekly feature of the wastewater-based epidemiology data was the second fpc, representing the difference between average midweek level and a peak during the weekend, representing possible recreational use of a drug in the weekend. Estimated scores on this fpc indicated recreational use of methylphenidate, with a high weekend peak, but not for methadone and oxazepam. The functional principal component analysis uncovered clinically important temporal features of the weekly patterns of the use of prescription drugs detected from wastewater analysis. This may be used as a post-marketing surveillance method to monitor prescription drugs with abuse potential. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27862608

We conducted an interrupted time series population-level cohort study at group health (gh), between january 2006 and september 2014, comparing mvc risk among cot patients who were gh members receiving care in either group practice or contracted care settings. Group practice cot risk reduction initiatives were implemented in two phases: (1) altered prescribing expectations and (2) multifaceted initiatives. These initiatives did not exist in the contracted care network. We compared the adjusted quarterly rate of mvc between group practice and contracted care patients over time using a modified poisson regression model for a binary outcome. A total of 32 691 cot patients (27.4% from contracted care) met eligibility criteria and experienced a total of 1956 mvcs during study follow-up (mean, 8.1 quarters per person), of which 810 were serious injury crashes. Crash rates were not significantly different between the patient groups within any of the time periods. Analyses stratified by concurrent prescription of a sedative hypnotic or benzodiazepine found no significant difference between the group practice and contracted care patients. There was a modest elevation of mvc risk for high-dose patients relative to former cot patients who stopped receiving opioids. The risk of mvc was not mitigated in a large cohort of cot patients exposed to a health plan policy initiative that substantially lowered mean opioid dose.

However, the effects of generic drugs in acute and severe illness remain controversial. This study aims to investigate treatment costs and outcomes of generic antibiotics prescribed for adults with a urinary tract infection in outpatient settings. The data source was the longitudinal health insurance database of taiwan. We included outpatients aged 20 years and above with a urinary tract infection who required one oral antibiotic for which brand-name and generic products were simultaneously available. Drug cost and overall healthcare expense of the index consultation, healthcare cost during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were the main dependent variables. Data were compared between brand-name and generic users from the entire cohort and a propensity score-matched samples. Results from the entire cohort and propensity score-matched samples were similar. Daily antibiotic cost was significantly lower among generic users than brand-name users. Significant lower total drug claims of the index consultation only existed in patients receiving the investigated antibiotics, while the drug price between brand-name and generic versions were relatively large (e.g., >50%). The overall healthcare cost of the index consultation, healthcare expenditure during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were similar between the two groups. Compared with those treated with brand-name antibiotics, outpatients who received generic antibiotics had equivalent treatment outcomes with lower drug costs. Generic antibiotics are effective and worthy of adoption among outpatients with simple infections indicating oral antibiotic treatment. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27862588

This study described the most common documented medication allergies and their reactions among a national cohort of veterans affairs (va) inpatients. We evaluated inpatient admissions in any va medical center from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2014. Each admission was linked with allergy history preceding or upon admission. Individual drugs were aggregated into drug class category including: penicillins, sulfonamides, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, opiates, hmg-coa reductase inhibitors (""statins"") and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory inhibitors (nsaid). Results were reported in aggregate and over time. Approximately ~10.8 million inpatient admissions occurred from 2000 to 2014. We found the most commonly reported allergy drug classes were penicillins (13%, n = 1 410 080), opiates (9.1%, n = 984 978), ace inhibitors (5.7%, n = 618 075) sulfonamides (5.1%, n = 558 653), nsaids (5.1%, n = 551 216) and statins (3.6%, n = 391 983). Several allergy histories increased over time including opiates (6.2 to 11.2%), ace inhibitors (1.3 to 10.2%), statins (0.3 to 7.3%) and nsaids (3.9 to 6.0%). Rash was the most commonly documented reaction on reports for penicillins (25.5%, n = 371 825), sulfonamides (25.6%, n = 165 954) and nsaids (10.3%, n = 65 741). The most common reaction for opiates was nausea/vomiting (17.9%, n = 211 864), cough/coughing for ace inhibitors (41.0%, n = 270 537) and muscle pain/myalgia for statins (34.1%, n = 186 565). We report that penicillins and opiates are the most commonly documented drug allergies among va inpatients, but other drug classes such as ace inhibitors, statins and nsaids are becoming increasingly common. Clinicians also commonly document non-allergic adrs in the allergy section such as cough or myalgia. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27862587

The study cohort consisted of individuals, ≥65 years in 2010, residing in the region västra götaland during 2005-2010. For individuals with and without long-term use of ppi in 2010, we investigated the prevalence of an underlying diagnosis, that is, an acid-related disease during the five preceding years, as well as concomitant long-term use of antiplatelet agents or cyclooxygenase inhibitors. In all, 278 205 individuals (median age: 74 years; 55% female; median 3 drugs per person; 5% nursing home residents, 11% with multi-dose drug dispensing) were included in the analyses, 32 421 (12%) of whom were on long-term treatment with ppi in 2010. For 12 253 individuals (38%) with such treatment, no underlying rationale was found. In individuals without a disease- or a drug-related reason for ppi use, nursing home residence, number of drugs, female sex, but not multi-dose drug dispensing, were associated with long-term use of ppi; adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval): 1.63 (1.49; 1.78), 1.27 (1.26; 1.28), 1.24 (1.19; 1.29), and 0.94 (0.88; 1.01), respectively. Long-term use of ppi occurs in one out of nine individuals in the older population. For four out of ten of these, no reason for ppi use can be identified. Nursing home residence, female sex, and greater number of drugs predict non-rational long-term use of ppi. © 2016 the authors.

These methods often require iteration and post-calibration to achieve covariate balance. In comparison, entropy balance (eb) optimizes covariate balance a priori by calibrating weights using the target's moments as constraints. We measured covariate balance empirically and by simulation by using absolute standardized mean difference (asmd), absolute bias (ab), and root mean square error (rmse), investigating two scenarios: the size of the observed (exposed) cohort exceeds the target (unexposed) cohort and vice versa. The empirical application weighted a commercial health plan cohort to a nationally representative national health and nutrition examination survey target on the same covariates and compared average total health care cost estimates across methods. Entropy balance alone achieved balance (asmd ≤ 0.10) on all covariates in simulation and empirically. In simulation scenario i, eb achieved the lowest ab and rmse (13.64, 31.19) compared with ipw (263.05, 263.99) and sipw (319.91, 320.71). In scenario ii, eb outperformed ipw and sipw with smaller ab and rmse. In scenarios i and ii, eb achieved the lowest mean estimate difference from the simulated population outcome ($490.05, $487.62) compared with ipw and sipw, respectively. Empirically, only eb differed from the unweighted mean cost indicating ipw, and sipw weighting was ineffective. Entropy balance demonstrated the bias-variance tradeoff achieving higher estimate accuracy, yet lower estimate precision, compared with ipw methods. Eb weighting required no post-processing and effectively mitigated observed bias and confounding. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27859943

However, a lack of data persists in assessing whether carvedilol or bisoprolol are superior to metoprolol tartrate in clinical practice. We endeavored to compare the effectiveness of β-blockers among older adults following a primary hospital admission for hf. We conducted a cohort study using quebec administrative databases to identify patients who were using β-blockers, carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol tartrate after the diagnosis of hf. We characterized the patients by the type of β-blocker prescribed at discharge of their first hf hospitalization. An adjusted multivariate cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. We also conducted analyses by matching for a propensity score for initiation of β-blocker therapy and assessed the effect on primary outcome. Among 3197 patients with hf with a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the crude annual mortality rates (per 100 person-years) were at 16, 14.9, and 17.7 for metoprolol tartrate, carvedilol, and bisoprolol, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios of carvedilol (hazard ratio 0.92; 0.78-1.09) and bisoprolol (hazard ratio 1.04; 0.93-1.16) were not significantly different from that of metoprolol tartrate in improving survival. After matching for propensity score, carvedilol and bisoprolol showed no additional benefit with respect to all-cause mortality compared with metoprolol tartrate. Our evidence suggests no differential effect of β-blockers on all-cause mortality among older adults with hf. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27859924

Quasi-experimental design (non-randomized intervention) comparing the utilization of aliskiren + acei or arb in a primary care area-intervention (pca-i) with a primary care area-control (pca-c) following a safety alert. All physicians were provided with a list of diabetic patients (dm) on aliskiren + acei or arb. Physicians in the pca-i received also a non-dm patients list, a report with recommendations and information on the utilization of aliskiren + acei or arb in their area. Information was obtained from electronic medical records, period from may 2010 to december 2012. Interrupted time series analysis were used to assess the effect of the intervention on the number of patients on aliskiren + acei or arb. The number of dm receiving aliskiren + acei or arb at the time of the alert (23 december 2011) was 106 in the pca-i (91 non-dm) and 45 in the pca-c (25 non-dm). After the alert, a decreased in the number of patients on aliskiren + acei or arb was noted at both pcas, although the average of daily treatments ended was significantly higher in the pca-i, both in the dm group (slope after alert: -0.81, 95%ci -0.91 to -0.71 vs. -0.30, 95%ci -0.37 to -0.22) as well as in the non-dm group (-0.56, 95%ci -0.67 to -0.45 vs. -0.10 95%ci -0.17 to -0.04). The prescription of aliskiren + acei or arb decreased at both pcas, albeit such decreased was more significant at the pca-i. The intervention led to a more expeditious implementation of the safety alert recommendations. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27859873

A cross-sectional study repeated yearly was conducted using data from the french national healthcare insurance system. New benzodiazepine users were defined as users without any benzodiazepine dispensing in the year prior to the first dispensing of benzodiazepine in each year. Relative changes in incidence of use were calculated with the year 2006 as reference; confidence intervals for changes were estimated using the bootstrap method. Over the study period, the incident use of benzodiazepines decreased from 6.2% to 5.9%; this corresponded to a 5.1% decrease (95%ci: -6.8% to -4.2%) for 2012 compared to 2006. The decrease mainly concerned hypnotics (-15.5%; -21.2% to -15.3%) and appeared more pronounced in people aged 18-44 years. Incident use of anxiolytics remained stable overall during the period (4.0% of the population). Within anxiolytics, incident use of long half-life benzodiazepines (bromazepam, prazepam) decreased in favor of short half-life benzodiazepines (alprazolam, oxazepam). This change concerned patients aged 65-79 and patients aged 80 years and over. Nevertheless, in 2012, nearly one third of incident users aged 65 years and over started a treatment with a long half-life benzodiazepine, mostly bromazepam. A limited decrease in incident benzodiazepine use was observed in france between 2006 and 2012 that concerned only hypnotics. Although congruent with recommendations, this improvement appears insufficient with regard to the level of exposure to these drugs in france. New actions especially targeting anxiolytic benzodiazepine use should be undertaken to consolidate these results. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27807907

The objective of this study was to describe and discuss the safety monitoring methodology and the challenges associated with ensuring patient safety in the sls. Refinements to safety monitoring processes and infrastructure are also discussed. The study results are outside the remit of this paper. The results of the copd study were published recently and a more in-depth exploration of the safety results will be the subject of future publications. The sls used a linked database system to capture relevant data from primary care practices in salford and south manchester, two university hospitals and other national databases. Patient data were collated and analysed to create daily summaries that were used to alert a specialist safety team to potential safety events. Clinical research teams at participating general practitioner sites and pharmacies also captured safety events during routine consultations. Confidence in the safety monitoring processes over time allowed the methodology to be refined and streamlined without compromising patient safety or the timely collection of data. The information technology infrastructure also allowed additional details of safety information to be collected. Integration of multiple data sources in the sls may provide more comprehensive safety information than usually collected in standard randomised controlled trials. Application of the principles of safety monitoring methodology from the sls could facilitate safety monitoring processes for future pragmatic randomised controlled trials and yield important complementary safety and effectiveness data. © 2016 the authors pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety published by john wiley & sons ltd.",27804174

We aimed to investigate the longitudinal changes in the number of used drugs among complete responders, partial responders, and non-responders in a whole birth cohort of danish nonagenarians participating in a longitudinal survey. We obtained prescription data on all individuals born in 1905 and living in denmark when the danish 1905 cohort study was initiated in 1998 (n = 3600) using the danish national prescription registry. Drug use was assessed for complete responders, non-responders at baseline, and partial responders (i.e., dropouts) in the 4-month period preceding each wave of the study (1998, 2000, 2003, and 2005), that is, as the cohort aged from 92-93 to 99-100 years. Complete responders, non-responders, and partial responders used a similar number of drugs at baseline, on average 4.4, increasing to 5.6 at the age of 99-100 years. In all groups, the number of used drugs increased over time; partial responders had the largest increase of 0.39 drugs per year (95% confidence interval (ci): 0.33-0.44) compared with 0.32 (95%ci: 0.27-0.37) and 0.30 (95%ci: 0.25-0.35) in the other groups. Furthermore, the most frequently used drug classes (e.g., loop diuretics and paracetamol) and the drug classes with the largest change (e.g., increase: laxatives and paracetamol; decrease: benzodiazepines) were similar across response groups. The number of used drugs increased in all response groups between the age of 92 and 100 years.

We investigated adverse drug reactions (adrs) in boxed warnings for 44 oncological drug labels approved from 2004 to 2014 in both japan and the us. We applied conditional logistic regression to examine how likely it was for each adr to be included in a boxed warning. There were substantial differences in all sections of the labels. The concordance rate between us and japanese labels was 44.1% for serious adverse reactions and 30.5% for boxed warnings. Our regression analysis indicated that deaths and/or terminations related to specific adrs reported in clinical trials were significantly associated with inclusion of the adr in boxed warnings in japan, but not in the us. The boxed warnings of similar drugs seemed to affect those of follow-on drugs in both countries. Us drug labels were likely to influence japanese labels, but not vice versa. This study suggests that the observed differences are not solely due to differences in clinical outcomes between the two countries, but rather due to differences in regulatory considerations and historical factors in both local and global contexts. Further research is needed to examine the impact of these differences on public health and to determine how and to what extent we should intervene with this status quo.

We assessed whether statin use decreases the incidence of adverse influenza-related outcomes. Additionally, we used a new-user study design to minimize healthy user bias. We further examined the possibility of non-causal associations by using unrelated outcomes. We used the uk clinical practice research datalink to identify all patients aged 30 or older diagnosed with influenza-like illness during 1997-2010. Statin users were compared with propensity score-matched patients not receiving statins. The outcome was hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia or death in the 30 days following influenza diagnosis. Logistic regression estimated cumulative incidence ratios. The study cohort included 5181 statin users matched to 5181 non-users. The 30-day incidence of hospitalization or death was 3.5% in statin users and 5.2% in non-users, resulting in a 27% lower incidence with statin use (cumulative incidence ratio: 0.73, 95%ci: 0.59-0.89). New statin users were less protected against our composite outcome. The effect of statins was less pronounced among those with respiratory and cardiac disease. Statin use was shown to be associated with a non-statistically significant risk reduction of motor vehicle accident and burns. The attenuation of the effect of statins with the new-user design, supporting evidence from the assessment of effect modification, and additional sub-analyses evaluating the effect of statins on non-related outcomes suggest that the beneficial effect of statins on influenza-related adverse outcomes may be explained by a healthy user bias.

A drug utilization cohort study.",Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4110,"Following a tv documentary in 2013, there was a tremendous increase in low dose naltrexone (ldn) use in a wide range of unapproved indications in norway. We aim to describe the extent of this sudden and unprecedented increase in ldn prescribing, to characterize patients and ldn prescribers, and to estimate ldn dose sizes. Ldn prescriptions recorded in the norwegian prescription database (norpd) in 2013 and 2014, and sales data not recorded in norpd from the only norwegian ldn manufacturer were included in the study. According to norpd, 15 297 patients (0.3% of population) collected at least one ldn prescription. The actual number of users was higher as at least 23% of total sales were not recorded in norpd. After an initial wave, there was a steady stream of new and persistent users throughout the study period. Median patient age was 52 years, and 74% of patients were female. Median daily dose was 3.7 mg. Twenty percent of all doctors and 71% of general medicine practitioners registered in norway in 2014 prescribed ldn at least once. The tv documentary on ldn in norway was followed by a large increase in ldn prescribing, and the proportion of ldn users went from an insignificant number to 0.3% of the population. There was a high willingness to use and prescribe off label despite limited evidence. Observed median ldn dose, and age and gender distribution were as expected in typical ldn using patients. © 2016 the authors.

Data for t2dm patients aged 18+ years prescribed at least one anti-diabetic drug between 01/01/2000-30/06/2012 were extracted from the clinical practice research datalink. We examined the sequences in which anti-diabetic drugs were prescribed and, for patients on the most common anti-diabetic drug pathways, evaluated average hba1c values at treatment initiation and at progression to a second or third-line anti-diabetic drug class, including insulin. The cohort included 123 671 patients, 56% males, 95% aged 40+ and 79% with at least one recorded hba1c level. Metformin was the first prescription for 98 957 (80%) patients, with mean hba1c of 8.68% prior to initiation (95% confidence interval [ci] 8.67, 8.69). A total of 19 890 (16%) patients received sulphonylureas first-line (mean hba1c = 9.31%, 95%ci 9.27, 9.35). 1402 (12%) insulin users were prescribed insulin first-line (mean hba1c = 9.89%, 95%ci 9.59, 10.19). A total of 96 895 (78%) patients were managed in line with one of the treatment pathways recommended by nice. Patients prescribed insulin second-line after metformin had a mean hba1c of 10.11% (95%ci 9.83, 10.38) prior to first prescription of insulin and 9.98% (95%ci 9.73, 10.23) at baseline. Both values were significantly higher than other groups initiating new treatment. In over three-quarters of patients, anti-diabetic drugs are being prescribed per nice guidance. When insulin is being used earlier than recommended, there appears to be a need for urgent and rapid glycaemic control. © 2016 crown copyright.

1181,Suissa S;Moodie Ee;Dell'aniello S,2017,Prevalent new-user cohort designs for comparative drug effect studies by time-conditional propensity scores.,Pharmacoepidemiology And Drug Safety,10.1002/pds.4107,"Studies of the real-world comparative effectiveness of drugs conducted using computerized healthcare databases typically involve an incident new-user cohort design for head-to-head comparisons between two medications, using exclusively treatment-naïve patients. However, the desired contrast often involves one new drug compared with an older drug, of which many users of the new drug may have switched from, seriously restricting the scope of incident new-user studies. We introduce prevalent new-user cohort designs for head-to-head comparative drug effect studies, where incident new users are scarce. We define time-based and prescription-based exposure sets to compute time-conditional propensity scores of initiating the newer drug and to identify matched subjects receiving the comparator drug. We illustrate this approach using data from the uk's clinical practice research datalink to evaluate whether the newer glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (glp-1 analogs) used to treat type 2 diabetes increase the risk of heart failure, in comparison with the older similarly indicated sulfonylureas. Of the 170 031 users of antidiabetic agents from 2000 onwards, 79 682 used sulfonylureas (first use 2000), while 6196 used glp-1 analogs (first use 2007), 75% of which had previously used a sulfonylurea. After matching each glp-1 analog user to a sulfonylurea user on the time-conditional propensity scores from prescription-based exposure sets, the hazard ratio of heart failure with glp-1 use was 0.73 (95%ci: 0.57-0.93). The proposed prevalent new-user cohort design for comparative drug effects studies allows the use of all or most patients exposed to the newer drug, thus permitting a more comprehensive assessment of a new drug's safety.

To examine drug preferences, we used a structured survey of 8304 individuals entering treatment (2011-2014) for opioid use disorder followed by a more focused online survey (2014-2015) with a subset of these patients (n = 301). Our results demonstrated that both er and ir opioids were frequently abused by those with an opioid use disorder in terms of lifetime (91.0% vs. 98.7%, respectively) or past month (46.1% vs. 67.4%, respectively) abuse, but given the choice, only 4% of the sample selected er compounds as their preferred formulation. The remainder had no preference (29.9%) or a distinct preference for ir formulations (66.1%), regardless of route of administration-oral or non-oral (smoking/snorting or injecting). This preference for ir formulations seems to be related to: (i) the perceived immediacy and quality of the high (73.0%) from ir products; and (ii) they were easier to use, particularly when manipulated for non-oral abuse, than er products (31.2%). Based on these results, while most abusers have experience with both formulations, there is a greater preference for ir formulations, compared to er, regardless of route of administration. As a result, it may not be unreasonable to suggest that supply-side initiatives to restrict the diversion and abuse of prescription opioids may be just as important for both ir and er opioids.

We used the vha's linked pharmacy and patient medical records database to identify new prescriptions written for propoxyphene, fentanyl, and controlled release (cr) oxycodone between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2009. We plotted the monthly proportion of these prescriptions that complied with components of four specific safety alerts or directives for these substances issued by the vha or fda between 1/1/2001 and 12/31/2008. We modeled compliance using interrupted time series analysis and a generalized additive model with the addition of an indicator variable to flag prescriptions that followed the directive's release date. A total of 32.2 million new prescriptions for fentanyl, oxycodone cr, and propoxyphene were written for vha patients meeting inclusion criteria. Compliance with guidelines in the directives increased steadily throughout the entire study period, with no clinically meaningful inflection point near the date of each directive's release. Generalized additive modeling and interrupted time series analysis found that the indicator flag slightly improved the fit of the data, but visual inspection of the plots revealed no change at a level of practical significance. While prescribing compliance increased throughout the period, release of fda and vha alerts and guidelines did not appear to contribute to this change. Given the fivefold increase in the rate of drug-related overdose deaths since 1990, identifying effective methods to communicate safety messages and change prescriber behavior remains a priority for future work.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of men aged 66 years or older in ontario newly treated with testosterone between 1 january 2009 and 31 december 2012 using linked health administrative data. Continuous use was defined on the basis of prescription refills issued within 180 days of the preceding prescription. We studied men who received at least two consecutive trt prescriptions. We estimated the prevalence of hypogonadism, human immunodeficiency virus, specialist visits and lab tests for serum testosterone prior to initiation of trt to investigate concordance with prescribing criteria. We also performed a kaplan-meier analysis to test for differences in the median time to discontinuation among formulations. Among the 4797 men who received at least two trt prescriptions, only 38.7% met the reimbursement criteria for use prior to initiating therapy. The median time to discontinuation differed significantly among formulations and was longest among recipients of oral trt products (383 days), and lower for recipients of topical gels (319 days), injectable (283 days) and transdermal patches (160 days; log-rank test p < 0.001). A large proportion of older men in ontario do not appear to meet reimbursement criteria prior to commencing therapy, and many discontinue trt within a year of initiation.

In september 2006, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (pcv7) was introduced into the uk's routine childhood immunization programme. This study validated the pcv7 immunization status of children aged 2 years recorded in the ims disease analyses (da) database. The pcv7 vaccination uptake rate for children born in 2008 in the ims da database was calculated. A sample of 173 of the 2497 children not recorded as vaccinated was identified, and a questionnaire was sent to each of their general practitioners to ascertain the child's true pcv7 vaccination status. In the ims da data of 15 237 children born in 2008, 12 740 (83.6%) had a vaccination record of pcv7. One-hundred and eleven of the 167 questionnaires sent to the child's general practitioners were returned, giving an adjusted response rate of 111/167 (66.5%). Based on the general practitioners' responses, 71 (64%) of these children were fully vaccinated according to their general practitioner's records making the revised estimated vaccination rate for this cohort 94.1% conclusion: this validation study has shown that caution is needed if using historical ims patient-level data to analyse the effectiveness of pcv7 as there is a potential under-recording of immunization leading to under representation of vaccination rates by approximately 10%.

Given the importance of adjusting for cholesterol levels when evaluating the effect of statins, we assessed whether the protective effect of statins would remain when adjustment for cholesterol is performed. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiologic studies that reported quantitative estimates of the association between statins and incident pd and were published through february 2016. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to assess the effect of statins on pd separately among the studies that adjusted for either cholesterol or hyperlipidemia and studies that did not. Ten eligible studies that evaluated the use of statins and incident pd were identified. Among the six studies that did not adjust for cholesterol, a protective effect of statins was observed (relative risk 0.75; 95% confidence intervals (ci) 0.60 to 0.92). Excluding studies with possible bias because of reverse causation or stratifying on study design did not affect the results. No protective effect was observed among the four studies that adjusted for either cholesterol of hyperlipidemia (relative risk 0.91; 95%ci 0.68 to 1.22). The effect estimate for studies that adjusted for cholesterol was 1.04 (95%ci 0.68 to 1.59) when a study with immortal time bias was excluded. The apparent protective effect of statins on risk of pd is at least partially explained by confounding by statin indication. Immortal time bias and healthy user effects also could have contributed to biased results. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27527987

Results from dutch ae studies showed that-despite various improvement initiatives-the incidence of preventable mraes did not decline. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of mraes during hospitalizations using national patient data from records of patients admitted to dutch hospitals in 2008 and 2011/2012. Trained nurses and physicians reviewed the randomly selected records of 8071 patients admitted to one of 20 hospitals in 2008 or 2011/2012 during a two-stage review process. Patient and admission characteristics were collected. After identification of a mrae, physicians determined their potential preventability, drug type, related prescribing factors, and potential consequences. The physicians identified 928 adverse events (aes) in 857 admissions, of which 218 (15.2%) were medication-related. They judged 55 (18.4%) of these as preventable. Preventability of mraes was high in anticoagulant treatment (42.5%). Haematoma (39.0%) and intra-cerebral haemorrhage (25.5%) were common types of anticoagulant-related aes. Anticoagulant-related aes were often related to dosage factors (46.9%) and often resulted in an intervention (80.2%), of which 40.2% was judged as preventable. This study provided detailed information on mraes during hospital admissions in the netherlands. A substantial proportion of aes was medication-related (15.2%), of which 18.4% was judged to be preventable. As preventability in mraes was especially high in anticoagulant treatment (42.5%), those medications are a threat to patient safety. Future research and new safety programs should focus on prevention of aes related to this medication group. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",27193415
