The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and performance of a deterministic linkage procedure based on indirect personal identifiers included in the data sources. We identified users of glucose-lowering drugs with residence in four federal states in northern and southern germany (bavaria, bremen, hamburg, lower saxony) in the german pharmacoepidemiological research database (gepard) and assessed colorectal and thyroid cancer cases. Cancer registries of the federal states selected all colorectal and thyroid cancer cases between 2004 and 2015. A deterministic linkage approach was performed based on indirect personal identifiers such as year of birth, sex, area of residence, type of cancer and an absolute difference between the dates of cancer diagnosis in both data sources of at most 90 days. Results were compared to a probabilistic linkage using ""direct"" personal identifiers (gold standard). The deterministic linkage procedure yielded a sensitivity of 71.8% for colorectal cancer and 66.6% for thyroid cancer. For thyroid cancer, the sensitivity improved when using only inpatient diagnosis to define cancer in gepard (71.4%). Specificity was always above 99%. Using the probabilistic linkage to define cancer cases, the risk for colorectal cancer was estimated 10 percentage points lower than when using the deterministic approach. Sensitivity of the deterministic linkage approach appears to be too low to be considered as reasonable alternative to the probabilistic linkage procedure.","36129372"

Often there is interest in simultaneously testing for superiority, equivalence, inferiority, non-inferiority, and non-superiority, which can be achieved using a partition testing framework. Partition testing only requires selection of an equivalence margin and calculation of a two-sided wald confidence interval. In addition to permitting a broader range of inferences, the strengths of the approach include: mitigating publication bias, avoiding use of a clinically irrelevant nil hypothesis, and more transparent and impartial appraisal of the clinical importance of a study's findings by pre-specifying an equivalence margin. However, a challenge in implementing the approach can be the process for identifying an equivalence margin. The methodology is illustrated using a published study of the safety of ondansetron for the off-label treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Applying the method to the study results would have led to a conclusion that women exposed to ondansetron in comparison to those that are not, are equivalent with respect to risk of cardiac malformations and oral clefts. These conclusions are more in line with the magnitude of the observed effects than the conclusions resulting from a traditional inferiority/superiority testing conducted by the study authors.","36089808"

The extent of this practice in routine clinical care is however unknown. We aimed to evaluate the starting and maintenance ssri doses prescribed to patients stratified by levels of kidney function in real-world practice. Using data from the stockholm creatinine measurements (scream) project, we identified 101 409 new users of antidepressants (including 52 286 ssri users) in the region of stockholm during 2006-2019, who were ≥50 years of age and had a recent creatinine test taken in order to estimate glomerular filtration rate (egfr). Ssri dose reduction was defined as a prescribed ssri dose of ≤0.5 defined daily doses, according to current recommendations. We examined the associations between egfr and reductions in initial dose and maintenance dose of ssris using logistic regression models. Overall, reductions in initial and maintenance dose were observed among 54.1% and 34.1% of new ssri users. Nevertheless, about 40% of individuals with an egfr <30 ml/min/1.73 m  were prescribed an ssri without dose reduction. After adjusting for age and other covariates, lower egfr was associated with moderately higher odds of dose reduction, for both initial and maintenance dose. Compared to individuals with an egfr of 90-104 ml/min/1.73 m  , the adjusted odds ratios for those with an egfr <30 ml/min/1.73 m  were 1.18 (95% ci: 1.03, 1.36) for initial dose reduction, and 1.49 (1.29, 1.72) for maintenance dose reduction. Stratified analyses showed stronger associations between lower egfr and ssri dose reduction among individuals aged 50-64 years and in those receiving prescriptions from psychiatric care. Lower kidney function was moderately associated with a reduced ssri dose, independently of age. Prescribing ssris to middle-aged and older patients should not only consider patients' age but also their kidney function.","36076345"

Using data from the national poison data system for 2000-2020, population-based annual exposure rates by sex, antidepressant category, serious medical outcome, and health care facility admission were analyzed and odds ratios to assess associations of exposure type and antidepressant category with medical outcome and admission were calculated. There were 215 909 first-ranked unintentional exploratory exposures involving antidepressants among children <6 years old during the study period, averaging 10 281 annually. Most cases were <3 years old (77.8%), involved a single substance (86.9%), and did not receive treatment at a health care facility (57.6%); however, 7.9% were admitted and 3.4% had serious medical outcomes, including 13 deaths. Ssris were involved in 56.9% of all cases. Compared with ssris, bupropion (or: 5.22, 95% ci: 4.68-5.82), tcas (or: 3.74, 95% ci: 3.44-4.07), snris (or: 2.39, 95% ci: 2.11-2.71), and lithium salts (or: 2.00, 95% ci: 1.63-2.46) were more likely to be associated with a serious medical outcome. Tcas were the first-ranked substance in 7 of the 13 deaths. Although most unintentional antidepressant exposures related to pediatric exploratory behavior were inconsequential, an important minority of cases required admission to a hcf or had a serious medical outcome, including 13 deaths. Therefore, increased efforts to prevent these exposures among young children are needed, including public education and improved medication packaging.","35999648"

We aimed to prospectively investigate the incidence of adrs to first-line anti-tb drugs and related outcomes and qol. Adult patients with tb who had been treated with first-line anti-tb drugs in five korean hospitals were enrolled. Adr questionnaire surveys and blood tests were performed four times serially, and qol was assessed on the fourth tb treatment week (±2 weeks). Of 410 enrolled patients with tb (males, 62%; mean age, 52.1 ± 18.1 years [those aged ≥65 years, 26.6%]), 67.8% experienced any adrs (≥ grade 2) to tb drugs. The most common adr was fatigue (53.2%), followed by itching (42.7%) and anorexia (41.7%). Older adult patients experienced relatively more adrs, including anorexia, dyspepsia, rash, dizziness, anemia, abnormal hepatic/renal function tests, and increased uric acid levels (p < 0.05). Treatment regimens changed for 9.5% of patients owing to adrs to anti-tb drugs. Patients with any adrs and older adult patients had significantly lower qol than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Old age (odds ratio [or], 1.02) and being male (or 2.65) were independently associated with adrs, whereas active smoking (or 4.73) and a relatively long treatment phase (or 5.13) were independently associated with hepatotoxicity. Adrs to first-line anti-tb drugs were common and related to relatively low qol, especially among older adults. Although 9.5% of patients had adr-related regimen changes, most patients with adrs completed treatments successfully.","35909258"

Cardinality matching (cm), an optimization algorithm, overcomes these limitations by matching directly on the marginal distribution of covariates. This study compared the performance of psm and cm. Comparative cohort study of new users of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (acei) and β-blocker monotherapy identified from a large u.s. Administrative claims database. One-to-one matching was conducted through psm using nearest-neighbor matching (caliper = 0.15) and cm permitting a maximum standardized mean difference (smd) of 0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 between comparison groups. Matching covariates included 37 patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Observed covariates included patient demographics, and all observed prior conditions, drug exposures, and procedures. Residual confounding was assessed based on the expected absolute systematic error of negative control outcome experiments. Psm and cm were compared in terms of post-match patient retention, matching and observed covariate balance, and residual confounding within a 10%, 1%, 0.25% and 0.125% sample group. The eligible study population included 182 235 (acei: 129363; β-blocker: 56872) patients. Cm achieved superior patient retention and matching covariate balance in all analyses. After psm, 1.6% and 28.2% of matching covariates were imbalanced in the 10% and 0.125% sample groups, respectively. No significant difference in observed covariate balance was observed between matching techniques. Cm permitting a maximum smd <0.05 was associated with improved residual bias as compared to psm. We recommend cm with more stringent balance criteria as an alternative to psm when matching on a set of clinically relevant covariates.","35811396"

We sought to characterize pims by level of polypharmacy by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We performed a cross-sectional drug dispensing study using electronic health records available through the us department of veterans affairs. We extracted pharmacy fill and refill records during fiscal year 2016 (i.e., october 1, 2015-september 30, 2016) for all patients aged 49-70 who accessed care in the preceding fiscal year. Pims were defined by the combined beers and laroche (henceforth beers laroche) criteria used for older patients and the prompt criteria used for middle-aged. In the 1 499 586 patients aged 49-64, pims prevalence by prompt in patients with 0-4, 5-9, and ≥10 medications was 14.0%, 62.2%, and 86.1%, respectively, and by beers laroche was 14.3%, 63.4%, and 85.7%, respectively. In the 1 249 119 patients aged 65-70, pims prevalence by beers laroche was 14.8%, 59.9%, and 83.3%, and by prompt was 13.9%, 57.4%, and 82.0%, respectively. Meaningful differences in prevalence were shown by sex and race/ethnicity according to both set of criteria (e.g. Prompt in patients with 5-9 medications: 66.1% women vs. 59.3% men; standardized-mean-differences [smd] = 0.14; 61.7% of white vs. 54.5% of non-white; smd = 0.15). The most common pims were digestive, analgesic, antidiabetic, and psychotropic medications. Prevalence of pims was high and increased with polypharmacy. Beers laroche and prompt provided similar estimations inside and outside their target age, suggesting that pims are common among those with polypharmacy regardless of age.","35780391"

However, the prevalence of these biases in perinatal pharmacoepidemiology is not well understood. To describe the frequency of time-related biases in observational studies of medications commonly used during pregnancy (antibiotic, antifungal, and antiemetic drugs) via systematic review. We searched medline and embase for observational studies published between january 2013 and september 2020 and examining the association between antibiotic, antifungal, or antiemetic drugs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm delivery, small-for-gestational age, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. The proportion of studies with time-related biases was estimated overall and by type (immortal time bias, time-window bias). Our systematic review included 20 studies (16 cohort studies, 3 nested case-control studies, and 1 case-control study), of which 12 examined antibiotic, 6 antiemetic, and 2 anti-fungal drugs. Eleven studies (55%) had immortal time bias due to the misclassification of unexposed, event-free person-time between cohort entry and exposure initiation as exposed. No included study had time-window bias. The direction of effect varied for both studies with and without time-related bias, with many studies reporting very wide confidence intervals around the effect estimates, thus making the direction of effect less interpretable. However, studies with time-related bias were more likely to show protective or null associations compared with studies without time-related bias. Time-related biases occur frequently in observational studies of drug effects during pregnancy. The use of appropriate study design and analytical approaches is needed to prevent time-related biases and ensure study validity.","35753061"

Concerns have been raised about using exposure assessment time too close to the outcome. We investigated the association between use of α1-adrenoceptor antagonists indicated for benign prostate hyperplasia and risk of alzheimer's disease (ad) using different exposure windows. The study (24 602 cases and 98 397 matched controls) included men from the finnish nationwide nested case-control study on medication and alzheimer's disease (medalz). Cases received clinically verified ad diagnosis during 2005-2011 and were community-dwelling at the time of diagnosis. Use of tamsulosin and alfuzosin in 1995-2011 was identified from the prescription register and categorized based on whether it had occurred within 3 years before ad diagnosis (lag time) or before that. Dose-response analysis using defined daily doses of drug (ddds) was conducted. Associations were investigated with conditional logistic regression, adjusted for confounders and mediators. The use of α1-adrenoceptor antagonists before lag time associated with an increased risk of ad (or 1.24 [1.20-1.27]). After adjustment for comorbidities and concomitant drug use throughout the assessment time (confounders) and healthcare contacts within the lag period (mediators), the association weakened (aor 1.10 [1.06-1.14]). We found no evidence of dose-response-relationship when comparing the users of higher than median ddds to the users of lower than median ddds. Our findings, especially the lack of dose-response-relationship and attenuation after mediator adjustment, do not provide strong support for the previous hypothesis on α1-adrenoceptor antagonists as a risk factor for dementia.","35751619"

Consequently, there has been a recent focus on the development of data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic research. In this paper, we survey current approaches and recent advancements for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in healthcare database studies. We discuss considerations underpinning three areas for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment: (1) feature generation-transforming raw data into covariates (or features) to be used for proxy adjustment; (2) covariate prioritization, selection, and adjustment; and (3) diagnostic assessment. We discuss challenges and avenues of future development within each area. There is a large literature on methods for high-dimensional confounder prioritization/selection, but relatively little has been written on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment. Consequently, these areas have particular limitations and challenges. There is a growing body of evidence showing that machine-learning algorithms for high-dimensional proxy-confounder adjustment can supplement investigator-specified variables to improve confounding control compared to adjustment based on investigator-specified variables alone. However, more research is needed on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment when applying methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic studies.","35729705"

Reports from january 1, 2011 to december 31, 2020 were extracted from the faers. Icis-related adverse events in patients were defined as related to use of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibodies (pd-1, nivolumab and pembrolizumab), anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 inhibitors (pd-l1, atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and cemiplimab), and anti-cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (ctla-4, ipilimumab and tremelimumab). Icis-related ileus cases were identified to characterize their clinical features. Reporting odds ratios (ror) and information component (ic) were used to assess the relationship between icis and ileus. Among the 105 001 cases related to icis, 245 were reported with ici-related ileus. The affected patients were mainly elderly (median age, 64.5 years) and male (58%, n = 143). The median onset for all cases was 36 (range 0-880) days, and no statistical difference was observed between monotherapy and combination therapy (pd-1 or pd-l1 plus ctla-4) (p = 0.21). Most patients required drug withdrawal treatment (n = 113, 74%) and can achieve a recovered-resolved state (n = 72, 46%).

Some recent evidence suggests that among ansclc patients with pd-l1 + e of ≥50% receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy, very high levels of pd-l1 + e (≥90%) may be associated with better outcomes. We sought to assess whether very high pd-l1 + e (≥90%) compared to high pd-l1 + e (50%-89%) is associated with an overall survival benefit in ansclc patients receiving anti-pd-(l)1 monotherapies. We conducted a single-site retrospective cohort study of ansclc patients who initiated pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy as the first-line treatment from october 24, 2016, to august 25, 2021, and had a pd-l1 + e ≥ 50%. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from the start of the first-line pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy (index date) to date of death or last confirmed activity prior to the cohort exit date. Propensity score-based inverse probability weighting (ipw) was used to control for confounding in kaplan-meier curves and cox proportional hazard regression analysis. One hundred sixty-six patients with ansclc receiving pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy met inclusion criteria. 54% were female, 90% received pembrolizumab, median age was 68 years, 70% had non-squamous cell carcinoma, 94% had a history of smoking, 29% had a kras mutation, and 37% had very high pd-l1 + e. Unweighted covariates at cohort entry were similar between groups (absolute standardized mean differences [smds] <0.1) except for race (smd = 0.2); age at therapy initiation (smd = 0.13); smoking status (smd = 0.13), and braf mutation status (smd = 0.11). After weighting, baseline covariates were well balanced (all absolute smds <0.1). In the weighted analysis, having a very high pd-l1 + e was associated with lower mortality (weighted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% ci 0.36-0.90) and longer median survival: 3.85 versus 1.49 years. Very high pd-l1 + e (≥90%) was associated with an overall survival benefit over high pd-l1 + e (50%-89%) in patients receiving the first-line pd-(l)1 inhibitor monotherapy in a model controlling for potential confounders.

For each analytic method, we compared the average rr (across 2000 replicates) to the known risk ratio (rr) of 1.00. Smrw and drs yielded unbiased results (rr = 0.998 and 0.997, respectively). Tcps matching with replacement was also unbiased (rr = 0.999). Tcps matching without replacement was unbiased when matches were identified starting with patients with the shortest treatment history as initially proposed (rr = 0.999), but it resulted in very slight bias (rr = 0.983) when starting with patients with the longest treatment history. Similarly, creating a match pool without replacement starting with patients with the shortest treatment history yielded an unbiased estimate (rr = 0.997), but matching with the longest treatment history first resulted in substantial bias (rr = 0.903). The most biased strategy was matching after selecting one random comparator observation per individual that continued on the comparator (rr = 0.802).

Administrative health data from ontario, canada was used to measure differences in opioids dispensed and emergency department (ed) visits for opioid-related overdose, poisoning, or substance use following provincial restrictions on access to publicly insured oxycontin (february 29, 2012) and oxyneo (february 28, 2013). This study focused on the cohort of provincial drug insurance eligible people (people 65+ and select low-income populations) who were dispensed oxycodone prior to the restrictions. Difference-in-differences models with a propensity score matched comparison group of people who were dispensed non-oxycodone opioids were used to estimate the main effects. In 6 months following the delisting of oxycontin, milligrams of morphine equivalents (mmes) per person per week for all opioids fell by an average of 7.5% in people dispensed oxycodone relative to the comparison group, and an average of 13.8% in chronic recipients of oxycodone. In the 6 months following the restrictions on oxyneo, mmes per person per week fell by an average of 3.1% in all people dispensed oxycodone, and 25.2% in chronic oxycodone recipients. The decline in oxycodone dispensing among chronic oxycodone recipients corresponded with an increase in dispensing of other opioid formulations, particularly hydromorphone and fentanyl. No important differences were observed for ed visits related to opioid poisoning, overdose, or substance use disorder. Province-wide restrictions on access to long acting oxycodone had an impact on quantities of all opioids dispensed to chronic recipients of oxycodone, but small impacts on the full population of people dispensed oxycodone; the decline in use was partially offset by increases in use of other publicly-funded opioid formulations. This study suggests that policies limiting access to specific prescription opioids led to overall reductions in publicly funded prescription opioid use, particularly in chronic oxycodone recipients, without immediate evidence of changes in opioid-related ed visits.","35470515"

A cohort of new users of statins was used to demonstrate the differences between the standard survival model and the mixture cure model in the medication persistence analysis. The mixture cure model estimated effects of variables, reported as odds ratios (or) associated with likelihood of being long-term persistent and effects of variables, reported as hazard ratios (hr) associated with time to medication discontinuation among short-term persistent patients. Long-term persistent rate was estimated as 17% for statin users aged between 45 and 55 versus 10% for age less than 45 versus 4% for age greater than 55 via the mixture cure model. The hr of covariates estimated by the standard survival model (hr = 1.41, 95% ci = [1.35, 1.48]) were higher than those estimated by the mixture cure model (hr = 1.32, 95% ci = [1.25, 1.39]) when comparing patients with age greater than 55 to those between 45 and 55.

We followed them for up to 30 days after their second dose of an mrna vaccine to identify encounters for myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis. We compared two identification methods: a method that searched all encounter diagnoses using a brief text description (e.g., icd-10-cm code i40.9 is defined as 'acute myocarditis, unspecified'). We searched the text description of all inpatient or outpatient encounter diagnoses (in any position) for ""myocarditis"" or ""pericarditis."" the other method was developed by the centers for disease control and prevention's vaccine safety datalink (vsd), which searched for emergency department visits or hospitalizations with a select set of discharge icd-10-cm diagnosis codes. For both methods, two physicians independently reviewed the identified patient records and classified them as confirmed, probable or not cases using the cdc's case definition. The encounter methodology identified 14 distinct patients who met the confirmed or probable cdc case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis with an onset within 21 days of receipt of covid-19 vaccination. When we extended the search for relevant diagnoses to 30 days since vaccination, we identified two additional patients (for a total of 16 patients) who met the case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis, but those patients had been misdiagnosed at the time of their original presentation. Three of these patients had an icd-10-cm code of i51.4 ""myocarditis, unspecified;"" that code was omitted by the vsd algorithm (in the late fall of 2021). The vsd methodology identified 11 patients who met the cdc case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis. Seven (64%) of the 11 patients had initial care for myopericarditis outside of a kpnw facility and their diagnosis could not be ascertained by the vsd methodology until claims were submitted (median delay of 33 days; range of 12-195 days). Among those who received a second dose of vaccine (n = 146 785), we estimated a risk as 95.4 cases of myopericarditis per million second doses administered (95% ci, 52.1-160.0). We identified additional valid cases of myopericarditis following an mrna vaccination that would be missed by the vsd's search algorithm, which depends on select hospital discharge diagnosis codes. The true incidence of myopericarditis is markedly higher than the incidence reported to us advisory committees in the fall of 2021.

Sensitivity analyses were performed for three subgroups: (1) individuals symptomatic at time of positive test; (2) individuals tested during the pilot phase of rollout; and (3) individuals tested daily. Among 4989 same-day poc/naat pairs, 4957 (99.4%) were concordant, with 93.1% positive concordance and 99.6% negative concordance. Based on adjudicated case status, the false negative rate was 0.2% and false positive rate was 2.9%. In 43 instances, the immediate turnaround of results by poc allowed isolation of infected individuals 1 day sooner than lab-based testing. Positive/negative concordance in sensitivity analyses were relatively stable. Rt-pcr poc testing provided timely results that were highly concordant with lab-based naat in population surveillance. Expanded use of effective rt-pcr poc can enable rapid isolation of infected individuals and reduce covid-19 infection in the community.","35225407"

Patients who visited the queen mary hospital in 2005-2018 with ild were identified using the following icd-9 codes: post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis (ppf; icd-9: 515), idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis (ifa; icd-9: 516.3), connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (ctd-ild; icd-9: 517.2, 517.8, 714.81), sarcoidosis (icd-9: 135) and extrinsic allergic alveolitis (eaa; icd-9: 495). A random selection was conducted in cases with diagnostic code of ppf and ifa, where a relative higher case number was identified. All the cases of ctd-ild, sarcoidosis and eaa were included in validation for relatively small case number. Two hundred and sixty nine cases were validated using medical record review by a respiratory specialist. The overall positive predictive value (ppv) was 79% (95% ci, 74%-84%).

Therefore, the pattern of medication use should be monitored routinely. The aim of this study was to investigate the population-based prevalence of polypharmacy and the patterns of medication use in southwestern iran. We also investigated correlates between polypharmacy and patterns of medication use. Data from the khuzestan comprehensive health study (kchs) which consists information of 30 506 with age range to 20 to 65 years were used. Crude and age-standardized prevalence of polypharmacy and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated for different subpopulations. Multivariable poisson regression modeling was applied, and adjusted prevalence ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated. The anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system (first and second levels) was used for drug classification in different groups based on age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Out of 30 506 adults, 93.3% were not on any medications, and age- and gender-standardized prevalence of polypharmacy was 0.24%. The lowest estimated prevalence was among arab participants (0.13%). The prevalence of polypharmacy was 1.57% among elderly people, and 4.78% among patients with heart diseases. Socioeconomic status was not associated with polypharmacy (prevalence ratio: 0.95; p = 0.573) but was significantly associated with patterns of medications use for alimentary tract and metabolism and nervous system diseases. The most common drug classes were cardiovascular system (3.93%), alimentary tract and metabolism (2.79%), nervous system (1.01%), systemic hormonal preparations (0.69%), and blood and blood-forming organs (0.38%).

Using health claims data of the years 2004-2016 from the german pharmacoepidemiological research database, 160 273 patients aged ≥50 with incident dementia were identified and followed for 4 years. According to the incident icd-10 codes patients were assigned to the categories ad, vd or od. Changes between categories during follow-up were calculated. Overall, 18.8% had incident ad (vd: 21.5%, od: 59.7%). Fifteen thousand eight hundred forty-two patients had only one dementia diagnosis during 4 years (ad: 7.4%, vd: 12.4%, od: 9.8%). Among those with more than one diagnosis, the incident diagnosis matched the last diagnosis in 65.1% (ad), 53.9% (vd) and 73.8% (od) of patients. Changes in the diagnostic category were higher in patients with ad (mean: 5.1) than in patients with vd (3.6) or od (3.3). Patients with stable ad diagnoses during the observation period were younger (median: 76 vs. 79 years) and had less inpatient treatment days (median: 14 days) than patients with changes from an ad diagnosis to another category or from another category to ad (27 days).

Three pregnancy cohorts were identified from 16 health-plans in the sentinel system: 1) hospital admissions for live-birth, 2) hospital admissions for stillbirth, and 3) medical chart-confirmed stillbirths. Fertility procedures and prenatal tests, recommended within specific ga windows were evaluated for inclusion in our ga algorithm. Our ga algorithm was developed against a validated delivery-based ga algorithm in live-births, implemented within a sample of chart-confirmed stillbirths, and compared to national estimates of ga at stillbirth. Our algorithm, including fertility procedures and 11 prenatal tests, assigned a ga at delivery to 97.9% of live-births and 92.6% of stillbirths. For live-births (n = 4 701 207), it estimated ga within 2 weeks of a reference delivery-based ga algorithm in 82.5% of pregnancies, with a mean difference of 3.7 days. In chart-confirmed stillbirths (n = 49), it estimated ga within 2 weeks of the clinically recorded ga at delivery for 80% of pregnancies, with a mean difference of 11.1 days. Implementation of the algorithm in a cohort of stillbirths (n = 40 484) had an increased percentage of deliveries after 36 weeks compared to national estimates.

Mathematically we demonstrate how a standard sampling of controls, where controls are sampled among all subjects without an event at end-of-study, leads to a biased effect estimate. We propose to add the requirement that controls initiate treatment before the calendar time of event of their matched case to circumvent this. The standard and proposed sampling methods are compared in a simulation study and in an empirical data example examining the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage on the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. When the controls are sampled the standard way, the case-time-control design confers a bias because cases and controls have a different time-trend of exposure. The bias has been upwards in all the scenarios we have investigated. The requirement we add to be a potential control ensures that cases and controls have the same time-trend of exposure when treatment and outcome are independent. The simulation study confirms that the proposed sampling method removes the bias between treatment and outcome. The proposed sampling method lowered the odds-ratio estimate from 3.72 to 3.26 in the data example. The proposed sampling method makes it possible to use the case-time-control design in a cohort of subjects with registered use of a drug when outcome prevents further treatment.","35088482"

However, variable selection and unmeasured confounding are particularly challenging when analyzing large healthcare data. Machine learning methods may help address these challenges. The objective was to evaluate the capacity of such methods to select confounders and reduce unmeasured confounding bias. A simulation study with known true effects was conducted. Completely synthetic and partially synthetic data incorporating real large healthcare data were generated. We compared bayesian adjustment for confounding (bac), generalized bayesian causal effect estimation (gbcee), group lasso and doubly robust estimation, high-dimensional propensity score (hdps), and scalable collaborative targeted maximum likelihood algorithms. For the hdps, two adjustment approaches targeting the effect in the whole population were considered: full matching and inverse probability weighting. In scenarios without hidden confounders, most methods were essentially unbiased. The bias and variance of the hdps varied considerably according to the number of variables selected by the algorithm. In scenarios with hidden confounders, substantial bias reduction was achieved by using machine-learning methods to identify proxies as compared to adjusting only by observed confounders. Hdps and group lasso performed poorly in the partially synthetic simulation. Bac, gbcee, and scalable collaborative-targeted maximum likelihood algorithms performed particularly well. Machine learning can help to identify measured confounders in large healthcare databases. They can also capitalize on proxies of unmeasured confounders to substantially reduce residual confounding bias.","34953160"

For this observational cross-sectional study, all french psychiatrists were invited to enrol patients who had initiated pp3m in the previous 4 months. Snapshot data were collected at a routine consultation, without any modification of clinical practice. This population of 350 patients with schizophrenia started on pp3m predominantly included single men, living independently with a diagnosis of schizophrenia for a median of 9.3 years. Demographic characteristics were broadly comparable to those reported in other studies on lais. Investigators cited treatment simplification (96.9%) and patient comfort (93.3%) as the most common reasons for switching to pp3m; enhancing adherence was mentioned less often (61.1%) with most patients previously considered as adherent, and a majority of them expressing a positive attitude to their treatment. One-third of patients accepted the psychiatrist's proposal to initiate pp3m treatment without any discussion, and relatives were involved in the therapeutic decision-making process in only 23.7% of cases. After initiation, few changes were seen in professional follow-up frequency or concomitant pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities except for a decrease in antipsychotic polytherapy. Pp3m is mostly prescribed in adherent patients with fairly stable schizophrenia, and the longer dosing interval does not substantially affect patient care.","34897888"

Ticagrelor users had a higher incidence (per 1000 person-years) of respiratory bleeding (24.6 [95% confidence interval (ci): 22.1-27.3]; vs clopidogrel users: 14.4 [13.1-15.8]) and dyspnea (25.9 [23.3-28.7]; vs clopidogrel users: 16.8 [15.4-18.4]). Epistaxis accounted for 83-93% of respiratory bleeds. Adjusted analyses found increased risks of gout and acute renal failure with ticagrelor. Clopidogrel users were older with a higher prevalence of concomitant medications than ticagrelor users. Our study showed increased incidences of dyspnea and respiratory bleeding (mainly epistaxis) among current ticagrelor users compared with clopidogrel users, and increased risks of gout and acute renal failure after adjustment.","34802175"

We retrospectively identified inpatients who underwent surgery for gastric, colon, or liver cancer between april 2016 and march 2018 at four hospitals. Chart reviews were conducted to identify postsurgical infections. We used bootstrap analysis with backwards variable elimination to select independent variables from routinely collected diagnosis and procedure data. Selected variables were used to create a score predicting the chart review-identified infections, and the performance of the score was tested. Among the 746 eligible patients, 96 patients (13%) had postoperative infections. Three variables were identified as predictors: diagnosis of infectious disease recorded as a complication arising after admission, addition of an intravenous antibiotic, and bacterial microscopy or culture. The prediction model had a c-statistic of 0.885 and pseudo-r  of 0.358. A cut-off of one point of the score showed a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 72%, and a cut-off of two points showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 91%.

We aimed to analyze the nationwide trend of gastric acid-suppressing agents and analgesics. We obtained nationwide consumption data of analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [nsaids], opioids, others) and gastric acid-suppressing agents (proton pump inhibitors [ppi] and histamine-2 receptor antagonists [h2ras]) between years of 2014-2018 from iqvia turkey. Drug utilization was measured by defined daily dose (ddd)/1000 inhabitants/day (did) unit. Drug sales data were further used to test the correlation of ppis and h2ras to analgesics. During the study period, analgesic utilization increased from 65.7 to 67.4 did. Nsaids constituted 82.7%-84.9% of all analgesic utilization. The consumption of nsaids increased by 3.1%, and the most commonly consumed analgesic was diclofenac (18.5 ± 1.5 did), constituting 25.4%-29.0% of all analgesics. Ppi utilization was found to regularly raise from 52.1 did in 2014 to 72.0 did in 2018 with an overall increment of 38.2%. Use of h2ras was found to increase from 11.4 did in 2014 to 14.0 did in 2018. The physician visit-adjusted utilization of both antirheumatic nsaids and non-antirheumatic analgesics showed significantly moderate-strong positive correlations with ppis (r: 0.63, 0.48-0.76 and r: 0.63, 0.47-0.75, respectively) and h2ras (r: 0.61, 0.44-0.73 and r: 0.57, 0.41-0.71, respectively). The utilization trend exhibited a dramatic increase of the gastric acid-suppressing agents -more pronounced for ppis, with a modest increase in analgesics.

Using quebec healthcare administrative databases, we formed a cohort of 55 230 patients newly treated with oral anticoagulants between 2010 and 2016. The duration of dispensations was defined using two approaches: the recorded days supplied value, and the longitudinal coverage approximation (data-driven) that may account for individual variation in drug usage patterns. Propensity scores adjusted cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (hr) of major bleeding with dabigatran or rivaroxaban versus warfarin. Using the days supplied, the mean (and standard deviation) dispensation durations for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin were 19 (15), 19 (14), and 13 (12) days, respectively. Using the data-driven approach, the durations were 20 (16), 19 (15), and 15 (16) days, respectively. The choice of the approach had no impact on the hr estimates. In our settings, the data-driven approach closely approximated the recorded days supplied value for the standard dose therapies such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban. For warfarin, the data-driven approach captured more variability in the duration of dispensations compared to the days supplied value, which may better reflect the true drug-taking behavior of warfarin.

This approach would be of interest to students and investigators with initial training in pharmacoepidemiology. We illustrate the approach using a study about parkinson's disease. We described the exposure specifications according to the study question. Next, we refined the exposure measure by linking it to knowledge about four major concepts in drug safety and effectiveness studies: drug use patterns, duration, timing, and dose. We then used this knowledge to guide the ultimate choice of exposure measure: time-varying, cumulative 6-month exposure to tamsulosin (a drug used to treat prostate hyperplasia). The proposed approach links exposure specifications to four major concepts in drug safety and effectiveness studies.

In this nationwide observational study, we performed descriptive analyses of a cohort comprising all danish antihypertensive treatment users january 2016 through september 2020 (n = 1 316 476) with special focus on hydrochlorothiazide users (n = 309 743). Data were retrieved from the danish nationwide health registries, including the danish national prescription registry. The use of hydrochlorothiazide dropped by 44% from january 2016 to september 2020, with the proportion of all antihypertensive fills constituted by hydrochlorothiazide dropping from 12.7% to 7.2%. This decline was more pronounced among younger patients and patients with a history of skin cancer. Simultaneously, the monthly rate of new hydrochlorothiazide users in denmark dropped from ≈2350 throughout 2017 to 652 during 2020. The publication of an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer led to an estimated excess of up to 11 510 physical and 22 870 e-mail/phone consultations to general practitioners. No evidence for increased risk of adverse outcomes was found. The publication of increased risk of skin cancer with hydrochlorothiazide use has led to a marked decline in the use of hydrochlorothiazide in denmark. A temporary increase in rate of gp contacts was also observed. This highlights the potential impact from disseminating research findings to patients and clinicians.","34435407"

Potential cases were identified from the hospital administration system. The main outcome required at least one of the following: any type of specific in-hospital code (t78.2, t88.6, and t80.5) or specific outpatient code in combination with a symptom code or in-hospital non-specific code (t78.4, t88.7, and y57.9) in combination with two symptom codes. Ppv were calculated with 95% confidence interval. Sensitivity analyses modified type of codes, unit of analysis, verification criteria and time period. The most specific algorithm used only primary codes for ana (numbers added in brackets). Four hundred and sixteen eligible cases were evaluated, and 78 (37) potential ana cases were identified. Ppv were 62.8% (95% ci 51.1-73.5) (main) and 77.4% (58.9-90.4) (most specific). Ppv from all modifications ranged from 12.9% to 80.6%. The sensitivity of the main algorithm was 66.2%, specificity 91.5%, and negative predictive value 92.6%. Corresponding figures for the most specific algorithm were 32.4%, 98.0%, and 87.0%. The ppv of the main algorithm seems of acceptable validity for use in comparative safety research but will underestimate absolute risks by about a third.

The aim of this study was to determine the degree of correspondence between the ukrr-mpi and aki international classification disease-10 (icd-10) n17 coding in hospital episode statistics (hes) and whether hospital n17 coding correlated with 30-day mortality and emergency re-admission after aki. Aki e-alerts in people aged ≥18 years, collated in the ukrr-mpi during 2017, were linked to hes data to identify a hospitalised aki population. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyse associations between absence/presence of n17 codes and clinicodemographic features. Correlation of the percentage coded with n17 and 30-day mortality and emergency re-admission after aki were calculated at hospital level. In 2017, there were 301 540 adult episodes of hospitalised aki in england. Aki severity was positively associated with coding in hes, with a high degree of inter-hospital variability-aki stage 1 mean of 48.2% [sd 14.0], versus aki stage 3 mean of 83.3% [sd 7.3]. N17 coding in hes depended on demographic features, especially age (18-29 years vs. ≥85 years or 0.22, 95% ci 0.21-0.23), as well as sex and ethnicity. There was no evidence of association between the proportion of episodes coded for aki with short-term aki outcomes. Coding of aki in hes is influenced by many factors that result in an underestimation of aki. Using e-alerts to triangulate the true incidence of aki could provide a better understanding of the factors that affect hospital coding, potentially leading to improved coding, patient care and pharmacoepidemiologic research.","34418198"

Based on all pairs of last prescription and index date, we estimated prescription durations using the rwtd with robust variance estimation. In simulation studies with increasing misspecification we investigated bias, root mean square error (rmse) and coverage probability of the rwtd using multiple index dates (1, 5, 10, and 20). We applied the method to danish data on warfarin prescriptions from 2013 to 2014 stratifying by and adjusting for sex and age. In simulation scenarios without misspecification, the relative bias was negligible (-0.04% to 0.01%) and nominal coverage probabilities almost retained (93.8%-95.4%). Rmse decreased with the number of random index dates (e.g., from 1.3 with 1 index date to 0.6 days with 5). With misspecification, the relative bias was higher irrespective of the number of index dates. Precision increased with the number of index dates, and hence coverage probabilities decreased. When estimating durations of warfarin prescriptions in denmark, precision increased with number of index dates, in particular in strata with few patients (e.g., men 90+ years: width of 95% confidence interval was 16.2 days with 5 index dates versus 35.4 with 1).

Children <18 years of age, having current asthma and receiving an incident analgesic prescription were identified from a large medicaid managed care plan during years 2013 through 2018. Current asthma was defined as both receiving an asthma diagnosis and filling an anti-asthmatic medication during the 12-month period prior to the analgesic medication initiation. A scoring algorithm was applied to associate analgesic prescription with procedures and diagnoses according to perceived need for analgesia and time proximity. Of the 9529 children meeting the inclusion criteria, 2681 (28.1%) received an opioid prescription. Opioid analgesic dispensing was most common among children who had an outpatient surgery/procedure (29.4%), trauma (19.4%) dental procedure (18.4%), and respiratory infection (10.6%).

However, the granularity of the available covariate data may not be sufficiently fine, for example when covariates are measured for participants only when their exposure levels change. To illustrate the impact of choices regarding the frequency of measuring time-varying covariates, we simulated data for a large target trial and for large observational studies, varying in covariate measurement design. Covariates were measured never, on a fixed-interval basis, or each time the exposure level switched. For the analysis, it was assumed that covariates remain constant in periods of no measurement. Cumulative survival probabilities for continuous exposure and non-exposure were estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for time-varying confounding, with special emphasis on the difference between 5-year event risks. With monthly covariate measurements, estimates based on observational data coincided with trial-based estimates, with 5-year risk differences being zero. Without measurement of baseline or post-baseline covariates, this risk difference was estimated to be 49% based on the available observational data. With measurements on a fixed-interval basis only, 5-year risk differences deviated from the null, to 29% for 6-monthly measurements, and with magnitude increasing up to 35% as the interval length increased. Risk difference estimates diverged from the null to as low as -18% when covariates were measured depending on exposure level switching. Our simulations highlight the need for careful consideration of time-varying covariates in designing studies on time-varying exposures. We caution against implementing designs with long intervals between measurements. The maximum length required will depend on the rates at which treatments and covariates change, with higher rates requiring shorter measurement intervals.","34251702"

Exposure and confounders were measured and analysed in a time-dependant way. Risk estimates were pooled using a random effect model. 421 523 patients were included. The risk of major bleeding for the group of doacs compared to vkas showed a pooled hr of 0.94 (95% ci: 0.87-1.02). Rivaroxaban showed a modestly increased risk (hr 1.11, 95% ci: 1.06-1.16). Apixaban and dabigatran showed a decreased risk of respectively hr 0.76 (95% ci: 0.69-0.84) and hr 0.85 (95% ci: 0.75-0.96). This study confirms that the risk of major bleeding of doacs compared to vkas is not increased when combining all doacs. However, we observed a modest higher risk of major bleeding for rivaroxaban, whereas for apixaban and dabigatran lower risks of major bleeding were observed compared to vkas.","34173286"

As such, chronic conditions and age could modify the effect of vaccines. This study aimed at assessing the potential effect modification of influenza vaccine effectiveness (ive) by age and chronic conditions. We used eight-season data from the portuguese vaccine effectiveness study. Every season, physicians at primary care units recruited patients with influenza-like illness. Clinical data and swabs were collected for reverse transverse polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) detection of influenza. Trivalent inactivated ive was estimated as 1 - odds ratio (or) of being vaccinated in cases (rt-pcr positive for influenza) versus negative controls. Ors were obtained using a multivariable conditional logistic regression model, paired by week of onset within each season. Confounders were assessed by designing a specific causal diagram. Age (< 65 or ≥65 years) and chronic conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, chronic hepatic disease, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, and congenital or acquired immunodeficiency) were studied as effect modifiers by including an interaction term in the regression models. Significance was established at 5%. Point estimates indicate a higher ive in the chronic condition strata compared to that in the no chronic condition strata. Regarding age, different results were obtained considering the virus type and (sub)type. When comparing the ≥65 years with the <65 years of age strata, we observed a higher ive against a(h1n1)pdm09, an equal ive against a(h3n2) and a lower ive against b virus. However, all interaction terms were statistically insignificant, and this may be due to a small sample size.

Studies with both protocol and report were included and data was extracted from these documents to describe study characteristics and variables involved in the sampling methodology. Out of 1092 studies finalised between june 2017 and may 2019, 17 studies were eligible for review. Thirteen were surveys, three chart reviews and one combined both methodologies. All the 17 studies recruited hcps/sites and 8 of them also recruited patients. The most common rationale for country sampling was market uptake (10/17), while for hcp/site sampling, it was representativeness of the prescribing practices (14/17). Only a minority of the studies (4/17) provided supporting evidence to inform this theoretical framework. Hcp/site sampling frames were mainly network of physicians (5/17) or hcp databases (5/17), with only one study providing a detailed description of the sampling frame. Hcps were selected mainly using probabilistic sampling (10/17) and patients using non-probabilistic sampling (6/8). Only a few studies compared participating with non-participating hcps/sites (5/17) and patients (3/8). Eight studies reported that their results were generalisable. Overall, the study documents provided insufficient details to understand the rationale behind the sampling decisions.

Algorithms were developed using icd-10-cm diagnosis codes to identify potential stillbirths among females aged 12-55 years between july 2016 and june 2018. A random sample of medical charts (n = 169) was identified for chart abstraction and adjudication.

An online repeated, cross-sectional survey from 2018 to 2020 was used to estimate the number of adults in the united states who used prescription drugs in the general population and compared to estimated number of prescriptions dispensed over an equivalent time period. Joinpoint regression was used to quantify thresholds. A sample of respondents was retested to estimate reliability statistics. A model with a single threshold was the best fit, with the estimated threshold of 565 000 (95% ci: 9500-11 600 000) prescriptions dispensed per year. Above the threshold, there was a significant association between dispensing and estimates (p < 0.001); below the threshold, the relationship was not significant (p = 0.912).

However, current data on the care of refugees and migrants in initial reception centers is pending. This article provides data on prescription frequencies of various antibiotics and associated diagnoses. In this retrospective observational study, patient data of 3255 patients with 6376 medical contacts in two initial reception centers in germany were analyzed. Patient data, collected by chart review, included sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses, and prescriptions. Antibiotic prescription behavior and corresponding physician-coded diagnoses were analyzed. Nineteen percent of all patients in our study received systemic antibiotics during the observation period, with children below the age of 10 years receiving antibiotics most frequently (24%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were penicillins (65%), macrolides (12%), and cephalosporins (7%). The most frequent diagnoses associated with antibiotic prescription were acute tonsillitis (26%), bronchitis (21%), infections of the upper respiratory tract (14%), and urinary tract infections (10%). In case of acute bronchitis 74% of the antibiotic prescriptions were probably not indicated. In addition, we found a significant number of inappropriate prescriptions such as amoxicillin for tonsillitis (67%), and ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazol for urinary tract infections (49%). Regarding inappropriate prescription of antibiotics in refugee healthcare, this study shows a rate ranging from 8% for upper respiratory tract infections to 75% for acute bronchitis. Unnecessary use of antibiotics is a global problem contributing to gratuitous costs, side effects, and antimicrobial resistance. This research contributes to the development of stringent antibiotic stewardship regiments in the particularly vulnerable population of migrants and refugees.","33886141"

The methods and code-lists used to identify congenital malformations, and the methods and results of validations, were examined. We retrieved 54 eligible studies; 36 identified congenital malformations from primary care data and 18 from secondary care data alone or in combination with birth and/or death records. Identification in secondary care data relied on codes from the 'q' chapter for congenital malformations in icd-10. In contrast, studies using primary care data frequently used additional codes outside of the 'p' chapter for congenital malformation diagnoses in read, although the exact codes used were not always clear. Eight studies validated diagnoses identified in primary care data. The positive predictive value was highest (80%-100%) for congenital malformations overall, major malformations, and heart defects although the validity of the reference standard used was often uncertain. It was lowest for neural tube defects (71%) and developmental hip dysplasia (56%). Studies identifying congenital malformations from primary care data provided limited details about the methods used. The few validation studies were limited to diagnoses recorded in primary care.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact on the reporting trends in vaccine reports and on signal detection for vaccines. For assessment of the impact on the reporting trends, we performed the joinpoint trend analysis and descriptively considered number of vaccine reports grouped by the timing of the regulation change. For assessment of the impact on signal detection, we performed signal detection using dataset during the pre or postperiod of the regulation changes, and compared their agreement rates, which was calculated with a reference set for vaccines, created by the global research in paediatrics project. We retrieved 467 635 spontaneous reports, including 12 287 vaccine reports from april 2004 to march 2019. The average number of vaccine reports per year increased from 231 reports during the preperiod to 1227 during the postperiod. The joinpoint trend analysis found two joinpoints and differentiated three trends, significant increased trend of which was observed when regulations had changed. For signal detection, the agreement rate was improved when using data during the postperiod. We concluded that the regulation changes increased the number of vaccine reports, and could have improved signal detection performance for vaccines by accelerating accumulation of reports, while more spontaneous reports are necessary to optimize signal detection.","33733540"

Since the same surgery codes are used for bariatric and other gastrointestinal surgery we assessed code distribution patterns used in patients with bariatric versus other gastrointestinal surgery by presence of other conditions such as obesity and gastrointestinal cancer. We developed algorithms to identify bariatric surgery and calculated validity measures (ie, positive/negative predictive value [ppv/npv], sensitivity, and specificity) of each in cprd gold compared with hes (gold standard). Among 7 357 007 available patients we identified 10 190 patients who had a total of 14 046 potential bariatric surgery codes in cprd gold and/or hes. Surgery code patterns differed between bariatric surgery and assumed other gastrointestinal surgery. The sensitivity of cprd gold bariatric surgery coding improved from an overall of 56% to 69-71% when applying stricter algorithms (ie, in obese patients or obese, gastrointestinal disease/complication free patients) but ppvs remained at 53%-55%. Npvs and specificities of cprd gold bariatric surgery coding achieved ≥99.8% for all algorithms. Our results suggest that using cprd gold and hes data and a wide selection of surgery codes will result in the most complete and accurate capture of bariatric surgery events.

This prospective study was conducted in the emergency department of our hospital from april 1, 2017 to december 31, 2019. Ades of patients admitted to the emergency department were collected by a clinical pharmacist during daily pharmacy rounds. Of 4020 cases admitted to the emergency department, 198 emergency ade-related hospitalizations (4.93%) were noted, which were classified into certain (n = 0, 0%), probable (n = 122, 61.6%), and possible (n = 76, 38.4%). The ade was serious in 93.9% of the 198 cases. Ten cases were fatal, and two cases were life-threatening. More than 80% of the emergency ade-related hospitalization cases were of patients over 60 years. The pharmacological agents implicated in the hospitalizations were oral antiplatelet agents (20.7%), oral hypoglycemic agents (16.7%), insulin (11.1%), and antihypertensive agents (9.1%). The average length of ade-related hospital stay was 10 (7.0-14.0) days. Ade-related costs ranged from $1684.68 to $4531.35 for each hospitalization. The length of ade-related hospital stay and associated costs were statistically significant. Most ades (n = 146, 73.7%) were preventable. Most emergency ade-related hospitalizations in older adults resulted from lack of medication monitoring or inappropriate medication. Improved management of medicines by clinical pharmacists has the potential to reduce ade-related hospitalizations in older adults in china.","33630347"

The design was a repeated cross-sectional study in 1986, 1996, 2006 and 2016. At each wave, demographic and socio-professional characteristics, self-reported consumption of medications during the week before the occupational medical visit, and perceived difficult working conditions and extraprofessional problems were collected among a sample of workers. Factors associated with consumption of any drug and of main therapeutic classes were investigated through multivariate logistic regression models, using 2016 as the reference for investigating temporal trends. Prevalence of use of any drug was significantly higher in 2016, with marked changes observed in comparison with 1986: absolute decrease of psychotropic (-5.1%, p < 0.0001), antibiotics (-2.7%, p < 0.0001) and cardiovascular drug use (-3.8%, p < 0.0001), increase of analgesic use (+8.3%, p < 0.0001). Difficult working conditions, age and female gender were independently associated with analgesic drug use, and extraprofessional problems and female gender associated with psychotropic drug use. This analysis of self-reported drug use in the working environment illustrates the global patterns of medication use in a french active population over 3 decades.

We applied machine learning methods to predict lea among diabetes patients treated with canagliflozin. Using claims data from a 5% random sample of medicare beneficiaries, we identified 13 904 diabetes individuals initiating canagliflozin between april 2013 and december 2016. The samples were randomly and equally split into training and testing sets. We identified 41 predictor candidates using information from the year prior to canagliflozin initiation, and applied four machine learning approaches (elastic net, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [lasso], gradient boosting machine and random forests) to predict lea risk after canagliflozin initiation. The incidence rate of lea was 0.57% over a median 1.5 years follow-up. Lasso produced the best prediction, yielding a c-statistic of 0.81 (95% ci: 0.76, 0.86).

Using premier research database (october 2007-september 2017), we identified adults who were hospitalized for inpatient surgical procedures (n = 6 068 133). For each month, we calculated proportion of patients admitted that month who were administered (1) opioids, (2) acetaminophen, (3) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsads), and (4) gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin) during the postoperative period, defined as inpatient postoperative days 1-7, unless discharged earlier. For patients administered opioids, we estimated total and average daily postoperative opioid dose in morphine milligram equivalents (mmes). Monthly measures were standardized to the distribution of surgeries and the length of postoperative stay within each surgery during the last year of available data. Overall, 90.8% of patients were administered opioids postoperatively; mean total postoperative dose was 304 mmes (median 130). Both the frequency and the amount of opioids administered remained stable over 2007-2017. Postoperative use of acetaminophen increased from mean standardized monthly prevalence of 78% in 2007-2008 to 85% in 2017, while the use of nsaids remained stable at a standardized mean of 37%. The use of gabapentinoids increased from below 10% in 2007-2008 to the mean standardized monthly prevalence of 23% in 2017. Despite growing awareness of risks associated with postoperative opioid use, we observed no change in postoperative utilization of opioids in us hospitals. Increasing the use of non-opioid pain management approaches could constitute an important target in our efforts to curtail us opioid epidemic.","33368798"

To establish the relation between cognitive impairment and the anticholinergic drug burden we recorded the acb score for each patient at baseline. The relations between acb score and dementia or mmse scores were also examined after exclusion of patients taking any antipsychotic. A sample of 2140 elderly people was eligible for analysis. A significant dose-effect relationship was observed between total acb score and diagnosis of dementia in univariate and multivariate models. Patients in acb class ≥4 had about 4.5 times the risk of diagnosis of dementia. A relation was also found between higher acb scores and lower mmse scores; patients who scored 4 or more had a mean of 6.4 points lower than those not taking anticholinergic drugs. The dose-effect relationship between acb score and diagnosis of dementia was not maintained after exclusion of patients using antipsychotics, while the association between higher acb scores and lower mmse scores was still present, with patients in acb class ≥4 having a mean score about 4.4 lower.

Antibiotic utilization and change in utilization during the study period was calculated using linear regression (β coefficient). Eighteen hospitals had antibiotic utilization data available. Hospitals were primarily urban (72%) with an average of 209 total beds and 22 intensive care unit beds. Mean number of pharmacists in these hospitals was nine with a mean pharmacist: bed ratio of 0.05. While all hospitals had antimicrobial stewardship programs established during the study period, only 78% and 22% had infectious diseases (id) physician and id pharmacist on staff, respectively. A decrease in antipseudomonal β-lactams (excluding carbapenems) and fluoroquinolones was observed (β coefficients = -1.2 and -2.6, respectively), all other antibiotic classes had increased utilization. Overall antibiotic utilization increased over 5 years. The increase in narrow-spectrum β-lactams utilization along with the reduction in the use of antipseudomonal β-lactams and fluoroquinolones indicate appropriate antimicrobial stewardship. Institutional antibiotic utilization should be evaluated for appropriateness to limit the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics in an effort to reduce resistance development.","33094502"

This retrospective observational study was based on a series of patients from the ms expert center in rennes, france. We used a time-dependent propensity score defined as the linear predictor of a cox model estimating the hazard of being treated at each time from ms onset.

A multi-center, cohort study was conducted using claims databases of five large italian geographic areas. Yearly mean direct healthcare costs per patient were estimated, stratifying by ckd stage. The total yearly cost and potential savings related to esa use were estimated: (a) considering 25/50/75% of originator esa substitution with biosimilars; (b) eliminating inappropriate esa dispensing.

The secondary gold standard of allergic rhinitis was self-reported physician diagnosis. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), negative predictive value, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% ci) for each register-based algorithm in the two time periods. Sensitivity (≤0.40) was low for all algorithms irrespective of definition of allergic rhinitis (gold standard) or time period. The highest ppvs were obtained for algorithms requiring both antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids; yielding a ppv of 0.69 (0.62-0.75) and a corresponding sensitivity of 0.10 (0.09-0.12) for the primary gold standard of allergic rhinitis in 2012 to 2015. Algorithms based on both antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids yielded the highest ppvs. However, the ppvs were still moderate and came at the expense of low sensitivity when applying the strict primary gold standard (sige and nasal symptom).","32964608"

We present examples of external control groups that demonstrate some of the issues that arise and make recommendations to address them through careful assessment of the data source fitness for use, design, and analysis steps. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and context that produce a trial population may result in trial patients with different clinical characteristics than are present in an external comparison group. If these differences affect the risk of outcomes, then a comparison of outcome occurrence will be confounded. Further, patients who continue into lte may differ from those initially entering the trial due to treatment effects. Application of appropriate methods is needed to make valid inferences when such treatment or selection effects are present. Outcome measures in a trial may be ascertained and defined differently from what can be obtained in an external comparison group. Differences in sensitivity and specificity for identification or measurement of study outcomes leads to information bias that can also invalidate inferences. This review concentrates on threats to the valid use of external control groups both in the scenarios of single arm trials and lte of randomized controlled trials, along with methodological approaches to mitigate them.","32964514"

Many of these studies reporting remarkable effectiveness were shown to be affected by different time-related biases. We describe these biases and illustrate their effects using a cohort of patients treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). The quebec healthcare databases were used to form a cohort of 124 030 patients with copd, 50 years or older, treated between 2000 and 2015. Inhaled corticosteroids (ics) and long-acting bronchodilators were used as exposures, with diverse outcomes, including lung cancer, acute myocardial infarction and death, to illustrate protopathic, latency time, immortal time, time-window, depletion of susceptibles, and immeasurable time biases. Protopathic bias affected bronchodilator-defined cohort entry with an incident rate of lung cancer of 23.9 per 1000 in the first year, compared with around 12.0 in the subsequent years. When latency and immortal times were misclassified, ics were associated with decreased incidence of lung cancer (hazard ratio [hr] 0.32; 95% ci: 0.30-0.34), compared with 0.50 (95% ci: 0.48-0.53) after correcting for immortal time bias and 0.96 (95% ci: 0.91-1.02) after also correcting for latency time bias. Time-window, depletion of susceptibles and immeasurable time biases also affected the findings similarly. Many observational studies of new indications for older drugs reporting unrealistic effectiveness were affected by avoidable time-related biases. The apparent effectiveness often disappears with proper design and analysis. Future studies should consider these time-related issues to avoid severely biased results.","32783283"

We quantified multiple medicine use by calculating the number and proportion of people experiencing polypharmacy (the use of 5 or more unique medicines) and hyper-polypharmacy (the use of 10 or more unique medicines). We found that 9.0 million australians used at least one pbs medicine on september 25, 2018; equating to 27.5 million medicines in use across australia. ""cardiovascular system"", ""nervous system"" and ""alimentary tract and metabolism"" medicines comprised the top three medicine groups.

This survey was a cross-sectional analysis performed at the primary, secondary and tertiary health care levels in kosova. We included 930 registered tuberculosis patients within three levels of this health system in our study. Furthermore, we interviewed 62 physicians and 71 nurses at tb health facilities.

The representative age group was 19 to 29 years (30.49%), followed by a group of patients aged >60 years (23.23%). Among 930 patients treated with tb drugs, the total incidence of adverse aes was 29.03%. Female tb patients had a higher rate of aes than did male patients (33.56% vs 28.84%, respectively). The highest incidence of registered aes was recorded in the gastrointestinal system (270, 80.83%), followed by the central nervous system (cns, 7.50%) and was lower in other organ systems. The reporting of anti-tb drug effects by medical staff (tb medical doctor and tb medical nurse) at different levels of tb medical settings occurred among 62.90% of medical doctors and 81.69% of nurses. Only 53.23% of medical doctors and 46.48% of nurses completed pharmacovigilance training. The pharmacovigilance approach in health system of kosova is not comprehensible and not systematic. The relatively low incidence of aes among tb patients is due under reporting of these by medical staff.

The tightening of pbs criteria from 1 april 2015 to curb off-label prescribing remained effective and selective over 3 years yet total national testosterone prescribing continued with little change, reflecting a shift to private prescriptions. The continuation of off-label testosterone prescribing for unproven indications suggests that long-term androgen dependence is created in men without pathological hypogonadism who commence testosterone.

We used descriptive analysis and generalized linear models to analyzed pims and the predictors, and marginal effects methods were applied to estimate the mean adjusted pims prevalence. Overall, 4 528 884 elderly patient visits from 2014 to 2018 were eligible for inclusion. A total of 719 757 pims were detected, with 14.1% of the visits contained at least one pim. Pim prevalence was significantly correlated with age, number of prescribed medications and number of diagnoses. Overall, 6.0 per thousand elderly patients in chis were exposed to at least one high-risk pim, while 117.5 per thousand were exposed to at least one low-risk pim. In 2018, 20% of gps were responsible for more than half of overall pim visits. Prescribing of pims for older adults is common in chis in china, especially for patients who are aged, having multiple medications and diagnostic diseases. Strategies should be developed to enhance prescribing quality for geriatric patients, with special targeting of doctors responsible for a high number of pims.","32515047"

We conducted two nested case-control studies by analyzing the taiwan national health insurance research database from 2008 to 2013 among diabetic patients continuously receiving sulfonylureas. Cases were defined as patients with severe hypoglycemia and those with a composite outcome of severe hypoglycemia, altered consciousness, and fall-related fracture in the first and second study, respectively. In both studies, each case was individually matched up to 10 randomly-selected controls. Conditional logistic regressions were employed to estimate odds ratios (ors). We identified 1343 cases and 11 597 controls as well as 2848 cases of composite events and 24 808 controls among 46 317 sulfonylurea users. Concurrent use of amiodarone with sulfonylureas was associated with a 1.56-fold (95% ci: 0.98-2.46) increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, despite not statistically significant. Notably, an approximately 2-fold increased risk of severe hypoglycemia was observed with amiodarone therapy lasting for >180 days (adjusted or: 2.08; 95% ci: 1.01-4.30) or at a daily dose greater than 1 defined daily dose (adjusted or: 2.21; 95% ci: 1.25-3.91) when concurrently administrating sulfonylureas. A significantly increased risk of hypoglycemia-related composite events was also found with amiodarone concurrently used with sulfonylureas (adjusted or: 1.59; 95% ci: 1.13-2.24). Concurrent use of amiodarone and sulfonylureas is associated with an increased risk of serious hypoglycemia among diabetic patients, with an elevated risk for amiodarone used in a long-term or at a high daily dose.","32483856"

We estimated the occurrence of ed visits from zolpidem-attributed adrs using nationally representative, public health surveillance of medication harms (national electronic injury surveillance system-cooperative adverse drug event surveillance project, 2010-2017). We estimated the number of zolpidem prescriptions using iqvia national prescription audit, 2010-2017. We calculated rates of ed visits for zolpidem-attributed adrs per 10 000 dispensed zolpidem prescriptions and identified time trends and potential inflection points using joinpoint regression. For comparison, we repeated these analyses for sedating antidepressants commonly used to treat disordered sleep (trazodone, doxepin, and mirtazapine). The best-fit regression model for rates of ed visits for zolpidem-attributed adrs by 6-month intervals identified a single inflection point in the second half of 2014 (  = .024) with a 6.7% biannual decrease from 2010 to 2014 ([-13.1%, 0.3%],   = .059) and a 13.9% biannual increase from the second half of 2014 through 2017 ([-1.1%, 31.3%],   = .068).

Retrospective cohort study utilising national pharmaceutical dispensing and hospital admissions data 2007 to 2015. Patient follow-up included 90-day periods following the dispensing of nsaids. Risk for each adverse outcome in maori, pacific, european, and asian patients was estimated using multivariable poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, comorbidity and concurrent drug use. 3 023 067 patients were dispensed nsaids between 2008 and 2015. Their total intended duration of nsaid treatment encompassed 2 353 140 patient-years. Maori, pacific and asian patients were younger than european patients (all p < .001). After adjusting for other risk factors, maori (rate ratio: 2.54, 95% confidence interval: 2.23-2.90) and pacific patients (3.17, 2.69-3.74) were more likely to be hospitalised for ugib than europeans (reference), and heart failure (maori: 2.48, 2.24-2.74; pacific: 1.97, 1.69-2.30).

The parametric waiting time distribution (wtd) has been proposed as a method to estimate such durations. However, when prescription durations vary due to seasonal stockpiling, wtd estimates will vary with choice of index date. To counter this, we propose using random index dates. Within a calendar period of a given length, δ, we randomly sample individual index dates. We include the last prescription redemption prior to the index date in the analysis. Only redemptions within distance δ of the index date are included. In a simulation study with varying types and degrees of stockpiling at the end of the year, we investigated bias and precision of the reverse wtd with fixed and random index dates, respectively. In addition, we applied the new method to estimate durations of norwegian warfarin prescriptions in 2014. In simulation settings with stockpiling, the reverse wtd with random index dates had low relative biases (-0.65% to 6.64%) and high coverage probabilities (92.0% to 95.3%), although when stockpiling was pronounced, coverage probabilities decreased (2.7% to 85.8%). Using a fixed index date was inferior. The estimated duration of warfarin prescriptions in norway using random index dates was 131 (130; 132) days. In the presence of seasonal stockpiling, the wtd with random index dates provides estimates of prescription durations, which are more stable, less biased and with better coverage when compared to using a fixed index date.","32436295"

Ovid medline, embase, all ebm, and web of science were systematically searched from 1999 to february 2019, and the reference lists of the included papers were also searched for gray literature to identify any interventions and strategies that aimed to increase adr reporting. Two reviewers screened the papers for eligibility based on the inclusion criteria and extracted their key data and analyzed them descriptively. Ninety out of 14 501 papers met the selection criteria. Using computerized registration and active surveillance can increase adr reporting significantly. Educational interventions performed individually or combined with sending reminders and/or feedback, awards, and providing easier reporting channels can improve adr reporting over a short to medium term. Multiple interventions may have more impact than single-component interventions. Multiple interventions could cause a greater increase in adr reporting rates than single interventions. Although educational interventions appear to be effective, few studies have reviewed their long-term effects to ascertain whether the improvements are sustained over time.

Therefore, to better elucidate the potential causal impact of fq on aa, we quantitatively evaluated the potential confounding effect of smoking on this observed association. We conducted a series of quantitative bias analyses using three previously published approaches: the e-value approach, the rule-out approach, and the array approach. We additionally conducted a numerical comparison between the rule-out approach and the e-value approach. For an apparent relative risk of 2, the e-value is 3.41, suggesting that smoking needs to be associated with both fq and aa with a minimal magnitude of 3.41 to explain away the observed twofold fq-aa association. The array approach found that the prevalence of smoking among fq users would need to be at least 2.9 times higher (43%) than the nonusers (15%), assuming smoking increases the risk of aa by 7.6-fold. A numerical comparison demonstrated that the results from the rule-out approach are similar to that of the e-value approach when there is a lack of prior data on bias parameters. Using three different approaches, we demonstrate that the strengths of association between smoking and both fq and aa need to be unusually strong to fully account for the twofold increased risk between fq and aa. Therefore, it is unlikely that smoking alone would explain away the association reported in the epidemiologic studies.","32406104"

The aim of this report is to describe the integration of two types of real-world evidence, spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (adr), and observational health data (ohd) in the assessment of a post-authorization safety signal of ischemic colitis. Assessment of the statistical signal of ""nintedanib - colitis"" was undertaken using data from vigibase, ohd from the observational heath data sciences and informatics (ohdsi) collaborative, published literature, and openly available regulatory documents. Evidence synthesis was performed to support bradford hill criteria in causality assessment.

Ohd was used to calculate incidence rates of colitis in new users of nintedanib across multiple populations, supportive of consistency, and further evidence for strength of association. Literature review identified support for biological plausibility and analogy. Signal assessment was supplemented with characterization of real-world users and exploration of potential risk factors using ohd. An integrated approach using two forms of real-world data, spontaneous reports of adrs and data from observational databases allowed a comprehensive and efficient signal assessment of nintedanib and colitis.

A four-state health state transition model was used to assess the optimal time to initiate statins after a risk assessment, in order to prevent the highest number of cardiovascular events, for a given risk profile (age, gender, risk) and adherence rate. A clinical practice research datalink dataset linked to hospital episodes statistics and office for national statistics was used to inform the transition probabilities in this model, taking into account observed statin discontinuation and re-continuation patterns. Our results suggest, if statins are initiated in a cohort of 50-year old men with a 10% 10-year risk, we prevent 4.78 events per 100 individuals. If we wait 10 years to prescribe, at which point 10-year risk scores are at 20%, we prevent 5.45 events per 100 individuals. If the observed discontinuation rate was reduced by a sixth, third or half in the same cohort, we would prevent 7.29, 9.01 or 10.22 events per 100 individuals. In certain scenarios, extra cardiovascular disease events could be prevented by delaying statin initiation beyond a risk of 10% until reaching a age (59 for men, 63 for women), based on statin discontinuation rates in england.

Although rwe may be more reflective of real-world clinical practice, it cannot provide conclusive evidence of the safety and efficacy of cannabis medicines. While acknowledging its limitations, rwe may nonetheless provide some guidance on safety and adverse events of cannabis medicines. Rwe has already had a significant impact on the regulation of cannabis medicines.","32281186"

The purpose of this study is to examine primary and secondary adherence following the reduction in copays due to the introduction of generic ais. Using surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-medicare data, we identified 50 054 women diagnosed with incident breast cancer between 2008 and 2013. We compare women whose copays would change and those whose would not, due to the receipt of cost-sharing subsidies before and after generics were introduced using a difference-in-difference (dind) analysis. To examine primary and secondary nonadherence, we rely on a multistate model with four states (not yet initiated, user, not using, and death). We adjusted for baseline factors using inverse probability treatment weights and then simulated adherence for 36 months following diagnosis. The generic introduction of ais resulted in patients initiating ais faster (dind = -4.7%, 95%ci = -7.0, -2.3; patients not yet initiating treatment at 6-months), being more adherent (dind ranging in absolute increase of 8.1%-10.4%) and being less likely to not be using the therapy (dind range in absolute decrease of 1.2% at 6 months to 8.8% at 24 months) for women that do not receive a subsidy after generics were available.

The primary outcome was first recurrent ischemic stroke within a year after hospital discharge, while the secondary composite outcomes were (a) stroke recurrence and all-cause mortality and (b) stroke recurrence and cardiovascular mortality. The cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association between medication adherence and outcomes. Adjusted hazard ratios (ahrs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis) were reported. Among ischemic stroke patients prescribed with antithrombotics (n = 1139) or statins (n = 1160) at hospital discharge, about one-third were highly adherent to their medications. Patients with lower medication adherence tended to be younger, were admitted to private ward classes, and were without hypertension. Compared with the patients with high medication adherence, the risk of stroke recurrence was higher in patients with very low antithrombotic (ahr = 4.65; 95% ci: 1.45-14.89) or statin (ahr = 3.44; 95% ci: 0.93-12.74) adherence.

The amount of buprenorphine distributed from 2007 to 2017 was obtained from the drug enforcement administration's automated reports and consolidated ordering system. Data were expressed as the percent change and milligrams per person in each state. The formulations and cost for prescriptions covered by medicaid (2008 to 2018) were also examined. Buprenorphine distributed to pharmacies increased about 7-fold (476.8 to 3179.9 kg) while the quantities distributed to hospitals grew 5-fold (18.6 to 97.6 kg) nationally from 2007 to 2017.

More recently, a new paradigm is emerging-specifically within the context of preauthorization regulatory decision-making-for some novel uses of real-world evidence (rwe) from a variety of real-world data (rwd) sources to answer certain clinical questions. Traditionally reserved for rare diseases and other special circumstances, external controls (eg, historical controls) are recognized as a possible type of control arm for single-arm trials. However, creating and analyzing an external control arm using rwd can be challenging since design and analytics may not fully control for all systematic differences (biases). Nonetheless, certain biases can be attenuated using appropriate design and analytical approaches. The main objective of this paper is to improve the scientific rigor in the generation of external control arms using rwd.

Since the bse epidemic has been declining markedly, the us food and drug administration reevaluates the vcjd risk via use of bovine heparin. We developed a computational model to estimate the vcjd risk to patients receiving bovine heparin injections. The model incorporated information including bse prevalence, infectivity levels in the intestines, manufacturing batch size, yield of heparin, reduction in infectivity by manufacturing process, and the dose-response relationship. The model estimates a median risk of vcjd infection from a single intravenous dose (10 000 usp units) of heparin made from us-sourced bovine intestines to be 6.9 × 10  (2.5-97.fifth percentile: 1.5 × 10  -4.3 × 10  ), a risk of 1 in 145 million, and 4.6 × 10  (2.5-97.fifth percentile: 1.1 × 10  -2.6 × 10  ), a risk of 1 in 22 million for canada-sourced products.

A total of 693 of 50 127 (1.38%) opioid-naïve women met the criteria for chronic opioid use following hysterectomy. The baseline variables and initial opioid prescription characteristics predicted the pattern of long-term opioid use with moderate discrimination (c statistic = 0.70). Significant predictors of chronic opioid use included initial opioid daily dose (≥60 mme vs <40 mme, aor: 1.43, 95% ci: 1.14-1.79) and days' supply (4-7 days vs 1-3 days, aor: 1.28, 95% ci: 1.06-1.54; ≥8 days vs 1-3 days, aor: 1.41, 95% ci: 1.05-1.89).

All patients (cases) had been treated for injuries from january 2014 to december 2016. One-to-four case-control matching was performed for age, sex, calendar day of injury (index date), and follow-up duration. A conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate the odds ratio (or) for pregabalin use within 180 days prior to the index date between the matched cases and controls, with adjustment for comorbidities and relevant drug categories associated with a risk of injury. To minimize within-individual confounding, we also performed a case-crossover analysis to compare the odds of pregabalin use between a 30-day hazard period immediately before the injury and five consecutive 30-day control periods within individuals with injury. Among the 2 324 974 people in the nested cohort, we identified 18 084 cases with injury and 71 885 matched controls. The proportion of pregabalin use was 1.7% (304/18 084) and 1.1% (803/71 885), respectively. The adjusted or for injury was 1.22 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.06-1.40).

The aim of this case-crossover study was to apply association rule (ar) analysis to ascertain drug combinations contributing to the risk of aki in adults aged 65 years and older. We sourced a nationwide representative sample of new zealanders aged ≥65 years from the pharmaceutical collections and hospital discharge information. Prescription records (2005-2015) of drugs of interest were sourced from new zealand pharmaceutical collections (pharms). We classified medication exposure, as a binary variable, at individual drug level belonging to medication classes including antimicrobials, antihistamines, diuretics, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Several studies have associated the drugs of interest from these medication classes with aki in older adults. We extracted the first-time coded diagnosis of aki from the national minimal data set. A unique patient identifier linked the prescription data set to the event data set, to set up a case-crossover cohort, indexed at the first aki event. Ars were then applied to identify frequent drug combinations in the case and the control periods (l-day observation with a 35-day washout period), and the association of aki with each frequent drug combination was tested by computing a matched odds ratio (mor) and its 95% confidence interval (ci). We identified 55 747 individuals (mean age 82.14) from 2005 to 2014 with incident aki and exposed to at least one of the drugs of interest. Ars identified several medication classes including antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids are associated with aki. The frequently used medicines associated with aki are trimethoprim (mor = 1.68; 95% ci = [1.54-1.80]), ondansetron (mor = 1.43; 95% ci = [1.25-1.64]), codeine phosphate plus metoclopramide (mor = 1.37; 95% ci = [1.11-1.63]), and norfloxacin (mor = 1.24; 95% ci [1.05-1.42]).

The objective was to assess which factors remained determinants of antidementia drug prescriptions. A cross-sectional study was performed in 2013. Patients suffering from dementia, aged 65 and over, identified in the french national health insurance database were included. Because we anticipated a high correlation between age, comorbidities, and health care use, we first identified the patients' health status by a latent class analysis. Second, we performed adjusted logistic regression models. The explanatory variables were patients' health status, gender, prescription of nonpharmacological treatments (physical and speech therapies), prescription of psychotropic drugs, and access to health care. Among the 3873 patients included, 38% received antidementia drugs. Three latent classes of patients with different health status were identified. Patients with poor health status received significantly fewer antidementia drugs (p < .001). Patients with speech therapy or antidepressant drugs received significantly more antidementia drugs (p < .001), whereas patients with physical therapy received significantly fewer antidementia drugs (p = .006). Antidementia drugs were less likely to be prescribed for patients with poor health status. This result is encouraging for these frail patients who are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of treatments. At the same time, this result encourage targeting specifically patients in good health status for the use of a decision aid, in an attempt to limit prescriptions by involving patients and families.","32067291"

A wash-out period for rasb of 6 months preceding admission was used. Hospital data were linked with drug dispensation data and cause of death data. The associations between time-dependent rasb exposure and all-cause death and hf death, respectively, were examined by cox regression models. Interactions by gender and age were also investigated on the multiplicative and additive scales. Thirty thousand seven hundred twenty-one patients were analysed. Fifty-one percent were women. Median age was 83. Fifty-three percent of women and 64% of men received rasb after the index hospitalisation. Younger patients were more likely to receive rasb than older ones. One-year mortality was 28%. Rasb was associated with an overall hazard ratio (hr) for all-cause death of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.75), and an hr of 0.85 (0.77-0.93) for hf death.

This retrospective cohort study used individually linked surgery and prescription opioid dispensing data from ontario, canada to create a population-based sample of 135 659 opioid-naïve adults who underwent one of four surgical procedures (laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, knee meniscectomy, or breast excision) between 2013 and 2017. Patient age, in years, was categorized as 18 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, and 75 and over. Postoperative opioid prescriptions were identified as those filled on or within 6 days of surgical discharge date. For those who filled a prescription, we assessed the total morphine milligram equivalent (mme) dose, types of opioids, and any subsequent opioid prescriptions filled within 30 days of surgical discharge date. Results were presented stratified by surgical procedure. For three of the four surgical procedures we assessed, the proportion of patients who filled a postoperative opioid prescription decreased with age (p < 0.001 for trend), and there was a small shift in the type of opioid (more codeine or tramadol and less oxycodone; p < 0.001 for trend). However, the total mme dose of the initial prescription(s) filled showed minimal age-related trends.

Factors studied include age, sex, self-rated health, education, smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions. Polypharmacy was reported by 10% of participants overall, with higher prevalence among older (≥60 years) vs middle aged (<60 years) participants (overall: 20.9% vs 6.0%, p < .0001; for those reporting any medication use: 30.2% vs 15.9%, p < .0001).

Our example study used medicaid analytic extract (max) data to estimate the relative risk (rr) for prenatal serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) exposure and cardiac defects. Smoking and obesity are known confounders poorly captured in databases. Nhanes collects information on lifestyle factors, depression, and prescription medications. External adjustment requires information on the prevalence of confounders and their association with snri use; which was obtained from the nhanes. It also requires estimates of their association with the outcome, which were based on the literature and allowed us to correct the rr using sensitivity analyses. In max, the rr for the association between prenatal snri exposure and cardiac defects was 1.51 unadjusted and 1.20 adjusted for measured confounders and restricted to women with depression. In nhanes, among women of childbearing age with depression, the prevalence of smoking was 60.2% (95% confidence interval 43.2, 74.3) for snri users and 44.1% (39.6, 48.8) for nonusers of antidepressants. The corresponding estimates for obesity were 59.2% (43.2, 74.3) and 40.5% (35.9, 45.0), respectively. If the associations between smoking and obesity with cardiac defects are independent from each other and from other measured confounders, additional adjustment for smoking and obesity would move the rr from 1.20 to around 1.10. National surveys like nhanes are readily available sources of information on potential confounders and they can be used to assess and improve the validity of rr estimates from observational studies missing data on known risk factors.","31863536"

We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature (january 2007 to july 2018). We included studies examining opioid use for more than 30 days. We classified operationalization of ltot based on criteria used in the definitions. We extracted ltot predictors from multivariate models in studies of opioid-naïve individuals. The search retrieved 5,221 studies, and 34 studies were included. We extracted 41 unique variations of ltot definitions. About 36% of definitions required a cumulative duration of opioid use of 3 months. Only 17% of definitions considered consecutive observation periods, 27% used days' supply, and no definitions considered dose. We extracted 76 unique predictors of ltot from seven studies of opioid-naïve patients. Common predictors included pre-existing comorbidities (21.1%), non-opioid prescription medication use (13.2%), substance use disorders (10.5%), and mental health disorders (10.5%). Most ltot definitions aligned with the chronic pain definition (pain more than 3 months), and used cumulative duration of opioid use as a criterion, although most did not account for consistent use. Definitions were varied and rarely accounted for prescription characteristics, such as days' supply. Predictors of ltot were similar to known risk factors of opioid abuse, misuse, and overdose. As ltot becomes a central component of quality improvement efforts, researchers should incorporate criteria to identify consistent opioid use to build the evidence for safe and appropriate use of prescription opioids.","31851773"

This review explores how hybrid study designs that include features of rcts and studies with real-world data (rwd) can combine the advantages of both to generate rwe that is fit for regulatory purposes. Some hybrid designs include randomization and use pragmatic outcomes; other designs use single-arm trial data supplemented with external comparators derived from rwd or leverage novel data collection approaches to capture long-term outcomes in a real-world setting. Some of these approaches have already been successfully used in regulatory decisions, raising the possibility that studies using rwd could increasingly be used to augment or replace traditional rcts for the demonstration of drug effectiveness in certain contexts. These changes come against a background of long reliance on rcts for regulatory decision-making, which are labor-intensive, costly, and produce data that can have limited applicability in real-world clinical practice. While rwe from observational studies is well accepted for satisfying postapproval safety monitoring requirements, it has not commonly been used to demonstrate drug effectiveness for regulatory purposes. However, this position is changing as regulatory opinions, guidance frameworks, and rwd methodologies are evolving, with growing recognition of the value of using rwe that is acceptable for regulatory decision-making.","31823482"

Elderly ≥66 years, hospitalized for a first ami between january 1, 2006, and december 31, 2011 and covered by the public drug plan were identified. Exposure to grd (i.e. Simultaneous use of 1) antiplatelet, 2) beta-blocker, 3) lipid-lowering and 4) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin ii receptor blocker drugs) was assessed 30 and 365 days following hospital discharge. Associations between deprivation index and grd exposure were estimated with log-binomial regressions adjusting for potential confounders. Exposure to grd was 52.2% and 48.0%, 30 and 365 days after hospital discharge, respectively. No statistically significant association was observed in multivariate analysis for both time points. Thirty days post hospital discharge, adjusted prevalence ratio of non-exposure to grd was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.95-1.02) for most materially deprived vs. Least deprived and 1.04 (95% ci: 0.99-1.08) for most socially deprived vs. Least deprived. Similar results were observed for 365 days. Exposure to grd after a first urgent ami among older adults insured by the public drug plan in the province of quebec is relatively low.

We applied the algorithm to the notes of another 731 potential cases (423 from kpsc; 308 from other sites) with relevant codes (icd-9-cm diagnosis codes for anaphylaxis, vaccine adverse reactions, and allergic reactions; healthcare common procedure coding system codes for epinephrine administration). Nlp results were compared against a reference standard of chart reviewed and adjudicated cases. The algorithm was then separately applied to the notes of 6 427 359 kpsc vaccination visits (9 402 194 vaccine doses) without relevant codes. At kpsc, nlp identified 12 of 16 true vaccine-related cases and achieved a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 98.5%, positive predictive value (ppv) of 66.7%, and negative predictive value of 99.0% when applied to notes of patients with relevant diagnosis codes. Nlp did not identify the five true cases at other sites. When nlp was applied to the notes of kpsc patients without relevant codes, it captured eight additional true cases confirmed by chart review and adjudication. The current study demonstrated the potential to apply rule-based nlp algorithms to clinical notes to identify anaphylaxis cases. Increasing the size of training data, including clinical notes from all participating study sites in the training data, and preprocessing the clinical notes to handle special characters could improve the performance of the nlp algorithms.

We identified pregnancies in women aged 15 to 49 years registered in the database for pharmacoepidemiological research in primary care (bifap) between 2002 and 2015. The algorithm applied sequential cycles that searched in hierarchical order for indicators of conception, delivery or pregnancy loss, and other codes suggestive of pregnancy. Length of pregnancy was assessed by searching for last menstrual period (lmp) date, gestational age, and outcomes of pregnancy. Prescription of specific drugs during the pre-pregnancy period and first trimester and time trends during pregnancy were evaluated. We identified a total of 155 419 pregnancies during the study period (77.5% completed pregnancies, 21.5% pregnancies losses, 0.8% ectopic pregnancies, and 0.2% stillbirths). Excluding vitamins and supplements, 43.8% of women received at least one prescription during the pre-pregnancy period and 68.4% during the first trimester.

These elements are index day of incident exposure's determination of look-back or follow-up periods, exposure duration algorithms, heparin exposure exclusion, propensity score model variables, and cox proportional hazard model stratification. We covaried these elements using a fractional factorial design, resulting in 24 risk estimates for one outcome. We repeated eight of these combinations for two additional outcomes. We measured design effects on cohort sizes, follow-up time, and risk estimates. Small changes in specifications of index day and exposure algorithm affected the risk estimation process the most. They affected cohort size on average by 8 to 10%, follow-up time by up to 31%, and magnitude of log hazard ratios by up to 0.22. Other elements affected cohort before matching or risk estimate's precision but not its magnitude. Any change in design substantially altered the matched control-group subjects in 1:1 matching. Exposure-related design elements require attention from investigators initiating, evaluating, or wishing to replicate a study or from analysts standardizing definitions. The methods we developed, using factorial design and mapping design effect on causal estimation process, are applicable to planning of sensitivity analyses in similar studies.","31736149"

The use of acs in 2012 was quantitatively assessed by calculating standardized prescribed doses. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of the high use of strong acs (≥90 doses). Almost half of the subjects (47.2%) used more than 15 doses of strong acs during 2012. 17.0% of the subjects had an annual cumulative use of strong acs over 90 doses. Morbidities such as depression (odds ratio [or], 95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.56, 2.48-2.63), parkinson's disease (2.41, 2.26-2.56), genitourinary diseases (2.12, 2.07-2.16), polypharmacy (3.28, 3.21-3.36), and low income (1.29, 1.25-1.33) were strong predictors of their high use. Antihistamines (chlorpheniramine) and antidepressants (amitriptyline) greatly contributed to the total prescription of strong acs. Despite the vulnerability of older people to the adverse reactions of strong acs, their use seems to be at a high level in terms of cumulative usage among some elderly. More attention should be paid to older people with predictive factors of high use of strong acs. Key points despite the susceptibility of older people to negative anticholinergic effects, high use of strong anticholinergic agents was is quite frequent; 17.0% of the elderly had an annual cumulative use of these drugs ≥90 doses. Parkinson's disease, depression, genitourinary diseases, low income, and polypharmacy strongly predicted the high use of strong anticholinergic agents. A few strong anticholinergic agents, including antihistamines (chlorpheniramine) and antidepressants (amitriptyline), accounted for the majority of medications prescribed. Understanding the predictors of their high use by medical practitioners may result as more appropriate anticholinergic medications.","31692168"

After inverse probability of treatment weighting, we compared adherence (proportion of days covered [pdc]) and persistence (no gaps ≥30 and ≥60 consecutive days in therapy) to tki therapy. Patients initiating generic imatinib consistently had higher average pdc per month and over the 6-month follow-up period than initiators of branded imatinib. Average 6-month pdc was 92% (95%ci:89%-94%) for generic initiators and 85% (95%ci:83%-86%) for brand initiators.

We conducted a simulation study and a real-world analysis using the uk's clinical practice research datalink to evaluate multiple imputation for confounders that are systematically missing from a subset of data sites in mock distributed data networks. The simulation study addressed univariate missing data, while the real-world analysis addressed multivariate missing data. Both studies were designed as retrospective cohort studies of the effect of current statin use on the risk of myocardial infarction among patients with newly treated type 2 diabetes. In our simulation study, multiple imputation repaired bias from missing bmi in all scenarios, with a median bias reduction of 118% in the default scenario. In our real-world study, the multiply imputed analysis (hazard ratio [hr]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.69-1.08) was closer to the analysis that considered the true confounder values (hr: 0.85; 95% ci, 0.66-1.10) than the analysis that ignored them (hr: 0.93; 95% ci, 0.73-1.20).

Brintellix was renamed to trintellix in may 2016. Using brilinta and brintellix as a proof-of-concept feasibility use case, we assessed whether drug name confusion errors between the pair could be identified in electronic health care data via the combination of a claims-based algorithm and limited manual claims data review. Using data from the sentinel system, we defined potential errors as brintellix users without an on- or off-label indication for brintellix, without a dispensing for a drug with the same indications as brintellix, and with an on- or off-label indication for brilinta between -365 and +30 days after index brintellix dispensing; the reverse was done for brilinta. We manually reviewed claims profiles of potential cases. We identified 27 (0.1%) potential errors among 21 208 brintellix users; 16 appeared to be likely errors based on claims profile review.

We evaluated six randomized trials (five open-label and one double-blind) of anticancer therapies with varying levels of pro completion submitted to the food and drug administration (fda). We applied complete case analysis (cca), multiple imputation (mi), and principal stratification to evaluate pro results for quality of life (qol) and the domains of physical, role, and emotional function (pf, rf, and ef). Assignment to potential principal strata was by the expectation maximization algorithm using patient baseline characteristics. Completion rates in the experimental arm ranged from 66% to 94% and 51% to 95% in the control arm. Four trials had negligible completion differences between arms (1%-2%), and two had large differences favoring the experimental arm (15%-17%). For trials with negligible completion differences, principal stratification results were similar to cca and mi results for all domains. Notable differences in point estimates may be observed in trials with large differences in completion rates. However, in the examined trials, the confidence intervals for the principal stratification estimates overlapped with the ones obtained using cca. The principal stratification estimand may be a useful additional analysis, especially if pro completion differs between arms.","31410963"

Data on dispensed hypnotics and anxiolytics were obtained from the norwegian prescription database (norpd). As measures of validity, we calculated sensitivity and specificity using both self-reports and prescription records as the reference standard. Furthermore, we calculated cohen's kappa. Current self-reported medication use was compared with prescription data in time windows of both 100 and 200 days preceding questionnaire completion. The highest sensitivity was observed for current sleep medication use in the 100-day time window (sensitivity = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.74, 0.79) when using prescription records as the reference standard. Sensitivity was generally lower for tranquilizers compared with sleep medications. Cohen's kappa showed the highest agreement for the 200-day time window with substantial agreement for sleep medications (kappa = 0.64; 95% ci: 0.62, 0.67) and moderate agreement for tranquilizers (kappa = 0.45; 95% ci: 0.41, 0.48). The present study suggests moderate to substantial agreement between self-reported use of sleep medications and tranquilizers and dispensed drugs in a general adult population. The magnitude of agreement varied according to drug category and time window. Since self-reported and registry-based use of these drug classes does not match each other accurately, limitations of each data source should be considered when such medications are applied as the exposure or outcome in epidemiologic studies.","31407838"

Npds, which collects data on all calls to us poison control centers, and drug-involved mortality (dim), which combines information from literal text of us death certificates and national vital statistics systems, were queried for opioid-involved fatal cases from 2010 to 2015. Characteristics of the two case series were compared. Dim contained 154 016 opioid-involved overdose deaths, and npds contained 2524 fatal opioid exposures, a ratio of 61:1. The number of opioid deaths remained stable in npds but increased in dim over the 6-year period. On average, deaths involving opioids with higher mean dosage strength (in morphine milligram equivalents) per unit among dispensed prescriptions were more likely to be captured in dim relative to npds, as compared with those with a lower mean dosage strength per unit. The increase in fentanyl-related deaths seen in dim since 2013 was not observed in npds. Npds is a valuable drug safety surveillance resource due to its timeliness and drug specificity. However, it captures only a small fraction of opioid-involved fatal poisonings, and comparisons with data derived from death certificate literal text indicate that caution is warranted in making inferences about opioid-involved fatality trends over time or comparisons across opioids.","31402548"

For trial participants, aecopd episodes reported in ecrf were compared with algorithmically derived moderate/severe aecopd episodes identified in ehr. Episode characteristics (frequency, duration), sensitivity, and positive predictive value (ppv) were calculated. A match between ecrf and ehr episodes was defined as at least 1-day overlap. In the primary effectiveness analysis population (n = 2269), 3791 ehr episodes (mean [sd] length: 15.1 [3.59] days; range: 14-54) and 4403 moderate/severe aecopd ecrf episodes (mean length: 13.8 [16.20] days; range: 1-372) were identified. Ecrf episodes exceeding 28 days were usually broken up into shorter episodes in the ehr. Sensitivity was 63.6% and ppv 71.1%, where concordance was defined as at least 1-day overlap. The ehr algorithm performance was acceptable, indicating that ehr-derived aecopd episodes may provide an efficient, valid method of data collection. Comparing ehr-derived aecopd episodes with those collected by ecrf resulted in slightly fewer episodes, and ecrf episodes of extreme lengths were poorly captured in ehr.

Three alternative approaches, derived from different perspectives, implement restriction by trimming observations in the tails of the propensity score (ps). Across approaches, we compared the relationships between the overlap in treatment-specific ps distributions and the size of the balanced study population after trimming. The three trimming approaches considered were absolute trimming to the range 0.1<ps<0.9, asymmetric trimming to include subjects in both treatment groups with ps above the 5th percentile of the distribution in the target group and below the 95th percentile in the comparison group, and restriction to preference score values between 0.3 and 0.7. Comparisons of approaches used simulated pss from beta distributions and two example studies. The magnitude of the c-statistic strongly predicted (r  ≥.95) the percent of the balanced study population remaining. The balanced study population was largest under trimming at absolute ps levels, unless the target treatment was uncommon. Fewer than half of original study subjects remained after preference score trimming if c≥.80 and after asymmetric trimming if c≥.85. In examples, trimming improved the precision of estimated risk differences and identified apparent treatment effect heterogeneity in the ps tails where covariate balance was limited. Relative amounts of trimming in examples reflected the simulation results.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of different exposure definitions on the association between amiodarone use and the risk of acute pancreatitis. Using data from the dutch pharmo database network, incident amiodarone users were compared to incident users of a different type of antiarrhythmic drug. Eighteen different definitions were applied to define amiodarone exposure, including dichotomized, continuous and categorized cumulative definitions with lagged effects to account for the half-life of amiodarone. For each exposure definition, a cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (hr) of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. This study included 15,378 starters of amiodarone and 21,394 starters of other antiarrhythmic drugs. Adjusted hrs for acute pancreatitis ranged between 1.21-1.43 for dichotomized definitions of exposure to amiodarone, between 1.13-1.22 for dose definitions (per ddd) and between 0.52-1.72 for cumulative dose definitions, depending on the category. Accounting for lagged effects had little impact on estimated hrs. This study demonstrates the relative insensitivity of the association between amiodarone and the risk of acute pancreatitis against a broad range of different exposure definitions. Accounting for possible lagged effects had little impact, possibly because treatment switching and discontinuation was uncommon in this population.","31373736"

A nationwide cohort was conducted using 554 844 women with singleton and first recorded pregnancies regardless of previous pregnancy history from the danish medical birth register from 1996 to 2015. Exposure was recorded by use of the danish national prescription register and defined as women who had redeemed a prescribed nitrosatable drug in the first 22 weeks of pregnancy. The reference group was women with no redeemed prescribed nitrosatable drug in this time period. We categorized nitrosatable drugs as secondary amines, tertiary amines, and amides. Cox hazard regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (ahrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for stillbirth. Among the 84 720 exposed women, 348 had a stillbirth compared with 1690 stillbirths among the 470 124 unexposed women.

We used data from the epical2 cohort study. Hfref patients who had completed prescriptions at discharge and at 6-month follow-up were included and followed for 36 months. The following medication agents were considered adherent to guidelines: renin-angiotensin system (ras) blockers [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (acei) or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (arb)] plus a β-blocker (bb) or ras blocker plus bb plus mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (mras). The evolution of drug prescriptions and the adherence to esc guidelines were assessed by using sequence analysis and clustering approaches. Patient characteristics associated with nonadherence were identified by logistic regression analyses. A typology of four therapeutic clusters was obtained, among which two clusters were adherent to recommendations and two were not. The adherent clusters consisted of bitherapy (ras blockers-bb) and tritherapy (ras blockers-bb-mra) for about 64% of patients and remain stable over time. The nonadherent clusters consisted of nonprescription of bb for about 22% of patients or nonprescription of ras blocker for about 14%. The main reason for nonprescription of bb was a concomitant obstructive airway disease (asthma or copd) but was a concomitant chronic kidney disease for nonprescription of ras blocker. Adherence to guideline-recommended medications while being hospitalized is of great importance because prescriptions are quite stable over time after discharge. Hfref patients are most often older, with various comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease or asthma/copd, which importantly limit physicians' ability to prescribe recommended drugs, leading to suboptimal adherence to guidelines.","31339629"

Therefore, we developed a new algorithm to establish a pregnancy register in the uk clinical practice research datalink (cprd) gold primary care database. We compiled over 4000 read and entity codes to identify pregnancy-related records among women aged 11 to 49 years in cprd gold. Codes were categorised by the stage or outcome of pregnancy to facilitate delineation of pregnancy episodes. We constructed hierarchical rule systems to handle information from multiple sources. We assessed the validity of the register to identify pregnancy outcomes by comparing our results to linked hospitalisation records and office for national statistics population rates. Our algorithm identified 5.8 million pregnancies among 2.4 million women (january 1987-february 2018). We observed close agreement with hospitalisation data regarding completeness of pregnancy outcomes (91% sensitivity for deliveries and 77% for pregnancy losses) and their timing (median 0 days difference, interquartile range 0-2 days). Miscarriage and prematurity rates were consistent with population figures, although termination and, to a lesser extent, live birth rates were underestimated in the register. The pregnancy register offers huge research potential because of its large size, high completeness, and availability. Further validation work is underway to enhance this data resource and identify optimal approaches for its use.","31197928"

Supporting patients with tools could improve their confidence in discussions with health professionals and encourage reporting of suspected adrs to regulators. This study describes development and preliminary validation of an instrument: side effect patient assessment tool (se-past). Se-past was developed from survey and interview data involving patients experiencing suspected adrs. It included 10 statements enabling causality assessment, covering timing, additional information sources, and experiences, with four options: yes/no/don't know/not applicable. Scoring and weighting resulted in four categories of causal association: highly probable, probable, possible, unlikely. Validation involved obtaining feedback from 31 individuals experiencing an adr. Further validation involved online distribution through patient support groups and comparison of reported symptoms to known adrs. Validators found se-past easy to read (31), to understand (27), and to complete (29). A total of 294 respondents completed se-past online, with 98% completing eight or more causality assessment statements. Symptoms were categorised as highly probable (46; 16%), probable (80; 62%), possible (44; 15%), and unlikely (21; 7%). A total of 221 respondents identified one suspected medicine, with 95% of these reporting at least one symptom known to be an adr. Of 227 providing feedback, 139 (61%) found se-past useful, 160 (71%) felt motivated to discuss their experience with a health professional, and 136 (60%) were encouraged to report to the regulator. Se-past was easily completed and understood by people experiencing suspected adrs and could be useful in encouraging patient reporting to health professionals and agencies.","31197912"

The overall ppv was 47.0% (95% confidence interval [ci], 36.9-57.2). However, the ppvs for the three categories of diagnostic information in the dpc data (""main diagnosis,"" ""diagnosis causing admission,"" and ""most resource-intensive diagnosis"") were each more than 70% after excluding inappropriate patients. Additionally, the ppv focused on these three categories was 76.3% (95% ci, 59.8-88.6). Prescribed drugs with side effects of gi perforation were more frequently detected in ""definite a/b"" cases (p = .028).

We examined all filled opioid prescriptions between 2015 and 2016 from the arkansas prescription drug monitoring program. We calculated patient-to-prescriber travel times and number of prescribers bypassed for each prescription, adjusted for payment method. Opioid recipients traveling further than the nearest urban area and bypassing more prescribers than 99% of other recipients from the same zip code were identified as doctor hoppers. We calculated odds ratios to evaluate how doctor hopping and doctor shopping correspond to high-risk opioid uses. Approximately 0.72% of all opioid recipients in arkansas engaged in doctor hopping two or more times during the study period. Rates of doctor hopping varied spatially but were more common in rural areas. Doctor shopping was more common in urban areas. Both hopping and shopping were significantly associated with higher odds of engaging in high-risk opioid use. The combination of doctor hopping and doctor shopping metrics can predict high-risk use better than either metric alone and may allow for earlier detection than doctor shopping alone. Doctor hopping is positively associated with high-risk opioid use and is distinct from and complementary to doctor shopping.

Following ethics approval and piloting, a self-complete questionnaire was mailed to all registered community pharmacies in wales, uk (n = 713). A follow-up mailing was sent to nonresponders after 2 weeks. A response rate of 52% (n = 372) was achieved, of whom 57% had never submitted a yellow card. Key barriers to reporting were not seeing adrs, difficulty identifying the causative drug, not being sure which adrs to report, and lack of time. Key facilitators were being able to report through dispensary software and having clearer guidelines about what to report. Differences between those who had previously reported adrs and those who had not suggested lack of confidence and uncertainty about what to report were more of a barrier for nonreporters. Conversely, reporters wanted feedback on reports, ability to keep reports on their dispensary records, and remuneration to aid them with reporting. While the respondents generally expressed positive attitudes towards adr reporting, a number of barriers and potential facilitators were nevertheless identified. Clearer support and guidance for reporting, such as through a ""champions"" scheme similar to that run in welsh hospitals, may help current nonreporters to engage.","31131966"

We reviewed the output at each of five main processing steps common in both study programs: cohort identification, propensity score estimation, propensity score matching, patient follow-up, and risk estimation. Our findings point to several design features that warrant greater investigator attention when performing observational database studies: (a) treatment of recorded events (eg, diagnoses, procedures, and dispensings) co-occurring on the index date of study drug dispensing in cohort eligibility criteria and propensity score estimation and (b) construction of treatment episodes for study drugs of interest that have more complex dispensing patterns.

Ignoring these challenges may lead to biased estimation of drug-related risks highlighting the need for adequate statistical techniques. We reanalyze updated data of a recently published study provided by the german embryotox pharmacovigilance institute. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect of discontinuation of vitamin k antagonist phenprocoumon on the risk of spontaneous abortion. We outline multistate methodology as a powerful method removing bias in probability estimation inherent to commonly used crude proportions. We incorporate time-dependent discontinuation and competing pregnancy outcomes as separate states in a multistate model, which enables the formulation of hazard-based cox proportional hazard models and the application of so-called landmark techniques.

In yearly cohorts, we identified factors independently associated with disenrollment by using log-binomial regression models to estimate risk ratios (rr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). Among 2 053 100 unique patient years, the annual proportion of within-year disenrollment remained steady across years (range, 13% to 14%) whereas the annual proportion of end-of-year disenrollment varied widely (range, 8% to 26%). Independent predictors of within-year disenrollment were related to health status, including age, comorbidities, frailty, hospitalization, emergency room visits, use of durable medical equipment, use of preventive care, and use of prescription medications. In contrast, independent predictors of end-of-year disenrollment were related to health plan characteristics including insurance plan type and geographic characteristics.

It has been previously demonstrated that utilizing information from an internal randomly selected validation sample can help mitigate this bias. Using a monte carlo simulation-based approach, we study the properties of misclassification bias-adjusted odds-ratio estimators in a contingency table setting. We consider two methods of internal validation sampling; namely, simple random sampling and sampling conditional on the original (possibly incorrect) outcome status. Additional simulation studies are conducted to investigate these sampling approaches in a multi-table setting. We demonstrate that conditional validation sampling, across a range of subsampling fractions, can produce better estimates than those based on an unconditional simple random sample. This approach allows for greater flexibility in the chosen categorical composition of the validation data, as well as the potential for obtaining a more efficient estimator of the odds-ratio. We further demonstrate that this relationship holds for the mantel-haenszel misclassification bias-adjusted odds-ratio in stratified samples. Recommendations for the choice of validation subsampling fraction are also provided. Careful consideration when choosing the sampling scheme used to draw internal validation samples can improve the properties of the outcome misclassification bias-adjusted odds-ratio estimator in a (multiple) contingency table.","30746841"

Using taiwan's national health insurance research database, we identified patients who were newly prescribed with dpp-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones (tzds), or acarbose between 1 march 2009 and 31 december 2012. The exposure of studied drugs was categorized into five exclusive categories: dpp-4 inhibitor, tzd, acarbose, combined use, or non-use, and assessed in a time-varying manner. Time-dependent cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between dpp-4 inhibitors and the risk of arthralgia. Particularly, we tested the impact of different cumulative duration, timing, and individual substance of dpp-4 inhibitors use on risk of arthralgia. A corresponding nested case-control study using conditional logistic regression was conducted to verify this association. An increased risk of arthralgia was observed during the first year after initiating dpp-4 inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.35; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.04-1.75) but the risk declined with cumulative use. This duration-response relation was not found in tzds use and acarbose use. In the nested case-control study, there was a slightly increased risk of arthralgia (aor = 1.08; 95% ci, 1.04-1.12) associated with current dpp-4 inhibitor use.

Previous evaluations of abuse in the community have relied on population averaged interrupted time series poisson models with utilization offsets. However, competing interventions and secular trends complicate interpretation of time-series analyses. An alternative research design, trend-in-trend, accounts for heterogeneity in per capita opioid dispensing and unmeasured time-varying confounding, which provides a causal evaluation, provided that underlying assumptions are met. Trend-in-trend can be modeled using a logistic regression framework. In logistic regression, exposure was any product-specific outpatient dispensing by three-digit zip code and calendar quarter, for 22 opioids. The outcome was any product-specific abuse case ascertained from poison centers and drug treatment programs, covering 94% of the us population, between july 2009 and december 2016. Product-specific odds ratios compared places without dispensing with places with any dispensing; the causal contrast represents the odds of product-specific abuse in the community given exposure. Dispensing of new and low-volume opioids varied considerably across the country, with no region showing high of all products. Of 22 opioids analyzed, the three with approved labeling as intended to deter abuse ranked near the lowest in both absolute (population-adjusted rates: 1.7, 0.9, and 8.2 per million people per quarter, respectively) and relative measures (trend-in-trend ors: 1.96, 1.79, 1.69, respectively).

Data for both aforementioned formulation categories were converted into defined daily doses (ddd)/1000 population/day and examined descriptively and by segmented regression analyses (to identify significant breakpoints in trends). Tramadol use strongly increased in all provinces until 2009. After 2009, tramadol dispensing levels either decelerated their increase or plateaued; ""strong opioid"" dispensing levels, in comparison, increased strongly until 2011 and decelerated or decreased for the remaining period.

We used data on gold-standard and ehr-derived second breast cancers in a cohort of women with a prior breast cancer diagnosis from 1993 to 2006 enrolled in kaiser permanente washington. We simulated an exposure that was independent of the true outcome status. A surrogate outcome was then simulated with varying sensitivity and specificity according to exposure status.

Type i error rates were substantially inflated above the nominal level (5%) for even modest departures from nondifferential misclassification. Holding sensitivity in exposed and unexposed groups at 85%, a difference in specificity of 10% between the exposed and unexposed (80% vs 90%) resulted in a 36% type i error rate.

Safety signals were most frequently identified for new drugs that had been on the market for less than 5 years, but some signals were still identified for old drugs (≥20 years), and most of them were statistically significant. The proportion of the signals for ""serious"" events was significantly higher in the group of nonsignals by ror (fisher's exact test, p = 0.032).

In the any diagnosis approach, cases were defined by primary or secondary diagnostic codes for pancreatic cancer in outpatient or inpatient records. In the any inpatient diagnosis approach, cases were defined using only diagnoses in hospital discharge abstracts. In the algorithm approach, cases were identified by an algorithm that combined the first two approaches. Comparing each approach to the ocr, we calculated the expected value and 95% confidence interval (ci) of the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv). We also compared the event dates using each approach with those recorded in the ocr.

Main measures were the number of prescriptions, patients, tablets, and morphine milligram equivalents of opioids and nonopioid analgesics pre and post the policy change. We used logistic regression to assess the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and these measures. The schedule change was associated with significant declines in opioid prescriptions (20.9%, from 421 798 to 333 627) and the number of patients using opioids (11.4%, from 307 974 to 272 804).

Using previously developed methods, we extracted features from unstructured narrative data using nlp and applied rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to identify anaphylaxis among 62 potential cases previously classified by human experts as anaphylaxis (n = 33), not anaphylaxis (n = 27), and unknown (n = 2). The rule-based and similarity-based approaches demonstrated almost equal performance (recall 100% vs 100%, precision 60.3% vs 57.4%, f-measure: 0.753 vs 0.729). Reasons for misclassification included the inability of the algorithms to make the same clinical judgments as human experts about the timing, severity, or presence of alternative explanations; and the identification of terms consistent with anaphylaxis but present in conditions other than anaphylaxis. Although precision needs to be improved before these algorithms could be used without human review, we demonstrated that applying rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to unstructured narrative information from clinical records can be used for classification of anaphylaxis in the sentinel system. Further development and assessment of these methods in the sentinel system are warranted.","30152575"

We included all adults, who filled their first prescription of montelukast and antidepressants within an interval of 1 year. In the absence of an association between montelukast and antidepressant use, a symmetrical distribution of prescriptions is expected before and after montelukast initiation (ie, a sequence ratio [r  ] of 1.0). We subcategorized the subjects after the severity of underlying asthma disease. In total, 4450 subjects filled their first prescriptions of both montelukast and antidepressants within a 1-year interval: 2434 redeemed their first prescription of montelukast before antidepressants, and 2016 redeemed the medications in the opposite order (r  1.21 [95% ci 1.14-1.28]). We found r  above unity in groups with long-acting asthma treatment, but no increase in antidepressant prescription, when stratifying by the asthma severity. We found a weak association between the use of montelukast and the risk of being prescribed an antidepressant, unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Stratified analyses suggest that this association may relate to asthma, rather than to montelukast.","30136330"

A major drawback of this method is the inability to distinguish between new and non-new users of drugs, which for the study of hypersensitivity reactions is of utmost importance. We have explored an approach in which the exposure to the drugs of interest in the source population is inferred from a primary health care database (bifap), which helped us to identify drug initiators among all users and additionally adjust for potential confounders. A total of 44 sjs/ten cases from the registry and 44 000 controls randomly sampled from bifap and matched with cases for index date were included. We estimated the adjusted ors (aors) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) of sjs/ten associated with the new use of 13 drugs (for which we had at least two exposed cases) through a conditional logistic regression model.

We stated a cpa hypothesis that the substance-event combination is more likely to be a signal when the 2 following criteria are fulfilled: prr- is greater than 1 with at least 5 cases, and cpa method detects at least 2 successive change points of prr- which made consecutively increasing segments. We tested this hypothesis by 95 test cases identified from a drug safety reference set and 2 validated signals from eudravigilance database: cpa was applied on prr-. For benfluorex and avi, change points detected by cpa on prr- were more meaningful compared with monthly counts of reports: more change points detected and detected earlier.

Proportions of pregnant women using different medications in association with pregnancy, and annual relative change in medication use during 2005 to 2015, were calculated. In norway, 60% of pregnant women used prescription medications during pregnancy (2005-15), increasing from 57% in 2005 to 62% in 2015. The annual relative increase was 0.9% (95% ci: 0.8-1.0). In the first trimester, approximately 17% of the women used medications regarded as potentially teratogenic during 2005 to 2015, increasing from 15% to 19%. Overall, this proportion was higher in the first than in the second (8.9%) and third (8.0%) trimesters, and higher than in the 3 months after pregnancy (14%). The annual relative increase of medications regarded as potentially teratogenic in the first trimester was 2.5% (95% ci: 2.3-2.7). The proportion of women using potentially teratogenic medications in the first trimester of pregnancy have increased during the last decade. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of pregnancy when prescribing potentially teratogenic medication to women of fertile age and focus this in the consultations. The increasing trends call for the need of routine surveillance of adverse birth outcomes linked to medication use in pregnancy.","29920833"

An algorithm for processing prescription data was developed and tested using data from the clinical practice research datalink (cprd). The impact of varying assumptions was examined by estimating the association between 2 exemplar medications (oral hypoglycaemic drugs and glucocorticoids) and cardiovascular events after preparing multiple datasets derived from the same source prescription data. Each dataset was analysed using cox proportional hazards modelling. The algorithm included 10 decision nodes and 54 possible unique assumptions. Over 11 000 possible pathways through the algorithm were identified. In both exemplar studies, similar hazard ratios and standard errors were found for the majority of pathways; however, certain assumptions had a greater influence on results.

We demonstrate how pharmacoepidemiologists, in particular, may use altmetrics to understand scholarly impact and knowledge translation by providing a case study of a drug-safety study conducted by the canadian network of observational drug effect studies. A common approach to measuring research impact is the use of citation-based metrics, such as an article's citation count or a journal's impact factor. ""alternative"" metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly supported as a complementary measure of research uptake in the age of social media. Altmetrics are nontraditional indicators that capture a diverse set of traceable, online research-related artifacts including peer-reviewed publications and other research outputs (software, datasets, blogs, videos, posters, policy documents, presentations, social media posts, wiki entries, etc). Compared with traditional citation-based metrics, altmetrics take a more holistic view of research impact, attempting to capture the activity and engagement of both scholarly and nonscholarly communities. Despite the limited theoretical underpinnings, possible commercial influence, potential for gaming and manipulation, and numerous data quality-related issues, altmetrics are promising as a supplement to more traditional citation-based metrics because they can ingest and process a larger set of data points related to the flow and reach of scholarly communication from an expanded pool of stakeholders. Unlike citation-based metrics, altmetrics are not inherently rooted in the research publication process, which includes peer review; it is unclear to what extent they should be used for research evaluation.","29575351"

We developed a practical methodological framework, explicitly describing all steps involved: acquisition of relative or absolute risks and background event incidence rates, selection of disability weights and durations, and computation of the years lived with disability (yld) measure, with appropriate estimation of uncertainty. We present a worked example, in which yld is computed for 3 recognized adverse reactions following 3 childhood vaccination types, based on background incidence rates and relative/absolute risks retrieved from the literature. Yld provided extra insight into the health impact of an adverse event over presentation of incidence rates only, as severity and duration are additionally incorporated. As well as providing guidance for the deployment of daly methodology in the context of adverse events associated with vaccination, we also identified where data limitations potentially occur.

We performed a cohort study using the university of groningen iadb.nl prescription database (www.iadb.nl). We selected all elderly (≥60 years) who had ever been prescribed metoprolol and had a first co-prescription of paroxetine/fluoxetine, citalopram (weak cyp2d6 inhibitor), or mirtazapine (negative control) from 1994 to 2015. The exposure group was metoprolol and paroxetine/fluoxetine co-prescription, and the other groups acted as controls. The outcomes were early discontinuation and dose adjustment of metoprolol. Logistic regression was applied to estimate adjusted odds ratios (or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). Combinations of metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine, metoprolol-citalopram, and metoprolol-mirtazapine were started in 528, 673, and 625 patients, respectively. Compared with metoprolol-citalopram, metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine was not significantly associated with the early discontinuation and dose adjustment of metoprolol (or = 1.07, 95% ci:0.77-1.48; or = 0.87, 95% ci:0.57-1.33, respectively). In comparison with metoprolol-mirtazapine, metoprolol-paroxetine/fluoxetine was associated with a significant 43% relative increase in early discontinuation of metoprolol (or = 1.43, 95% ci:1.01-2.02) but no difference in the risk of dose adjustment.

Events adjudicated by regards study investigators were used as the gold standard. Stepwise selection was used to choose predictors from medicare data for inclusion in the algorithms. C-index, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv) were used to assess algorithm performance. Net reclassification index (nri) was used to compare the algorithms with an approach of classifying all deaths within 28 days following hospitalization for myocardial infarction and stroke to be fatal cvd. Data from 2,685 regards participants with linkage to medicare, who died between 2003 and 2013, were analyzed. The c-index for discriminating fatal cvd from other causes of death was 0.87. Using a cut-point that provided the closest observed-to-predicted number of fatal cvd events, the sensitivity was 0.64, specificity 0.90, ppv 0.65, and npv 0.90. The algorithms resulted in positive nris compared with using deaths within 28 days following hospitalization for myocardial infarction and stroke. Claims-based algorithms for discriminating fatal chd and fatal stroke performed similarly to fatal cvd.

This study examines the role of benzodiazepine and opioid prescriptions on overdose-both individually and synergistically-using data from medicare part d, a source of prescription drug claims for about 35 million americans. Prescribing data from the medicare part d public use files for 2013, 2014, and 2015 (approximately 3.5 billion prescription drug claims) are geolocated using the prescriber's national provider identifier to calculate the proportion of claims for opioids and benzodiazepines in each county. These rates are matched with overdose data and controls to compile an analytic dataset of 9105 county-years. Multinomial logistic regression is used to estimate the probability that a county experiences higher rates of overdose fatalities. A 1% increase in the benzodiazepine proportion of claims is associated with 1.2 odds of high, versus low, overdose (p < .1) and 1.4 odds of very high overdose (p < .05). Moreover, there was a substantial interaction between opioids and benzodiazepines (p < .001). A county with 6% benzodiazepine prescriptions and 12% opioid prescriptions has a .58 predicted probability of very high overdose, significantly higher (p < .001) than the .33 probability for a county with 12% opioid prescriptions but 3% benzodiazepine prescriptions. These findings shed light on the polydrug epidemiology of the overdose epidemic. Overdose deaths are highest where elevated opioid and benzodiazepine claims coexist. Overdose levels may reflect polydrug use and misuse, requiring clinical and policy responses beyond reducing opioid prescriptions.","29537112"

The aim of this study is to assess the risk of enteropathy associated with arbs and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ace-i) by using data from large administrative and claim databases. We obtained data from italian local health-care units and a large german claim database and included patients treated with olmesartan, other arbs, and ace-i. In the absence of a specific diagnosis code for sle, international classification of diseases codes for im were used. Analysis implemented a poisson regression with robust error variance procedure, which allowed accounting for different clusters (local health-care units and countries) and correctly estimating the standard error for the relative risk of rare event occurrence. Patients were divided into 3 groups: olmesartan (25.591, 5.5%), other arbs (104.901, 22.5%), and ace-i patients (334.951, 72.0%). Baseline characteristics were similar overall.

When international classification of diseases codes for coeliac disease were included, no differences were observed. We could not confirm previous findings of a higher risk of malabsorption in olmesartan-only patients, and drug-induced enteropathy should be considered the result of exposure to the class of arbs rather than a specific drug-related effect.","29457309"

The recommended childhood immunization schedule includes multiple vaccines in a visit. A key concern is safety of concomitant (same day) versus separate day vaccination. This paper addresses a methodological challenge for observational studies using a self-controlled design to investigate the safety of concomitant vaccination. We propose a process for distinguishing which of several concomitantly administered vaccines is responsible for increased risk of an adverse event while adjusting for confounding due to relationships between effect modifying risk factors and concomitant vaccine combinations. We illustrate the approach by re-examining the known increase in risk of seizure 7 to 10 days after measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccination and evaluating potential independent or modifying effects of other vaccines. Initial analyses suggested that dtap had both an independent and potentiating effect on seizure. After accounting for the relationship between age at vaccination and vaccine combination, there was little evidence for increased risk of seizure with same day administration of dtap and mmr; incidence rate ratio, 95% confidence interval 1.2 (0.9-1.6), p value = θ.226. We have shown that when using a self-controlled design to investigate safety of concomitant vaccination, it can be critically important to adjust for time-invariant effect modifying risk factors, such as age at time of vaccination, which are structurally related to vaccination patterns due to recommended immunization schedules.","29441647"

There were 1 488 869 and 2 224 420 incident ppi users in the before [pre] and after [post] periods, respectively. Users with 1 year or more of exposure decreased (8.4% vs 7.5%), as did mean days supplied/user (130.4 to 113.7 d among all users and 830.8 to 645.4 d among users with 1 y or more of exposure). Osteoporosis screening and interventions did not appear to increase, but the proportion of patients with fractures decreased (4.4% vs 3.1%). Prevalent user results were similar. This analysis demonstrated the ability to use sentinel tools to assess the effectiveness of a label change and accompanying communication at the population level and suggests an influence on subsequent dispensing behavior.","29392851"

Participants were free of baseline cardiovascular disease, and we excluded users of statins at baseline. Statin initiation was defined as a report of current use at any of the 4 subsequent exams. Primary outcomes were the change in left ventricular mass index (lvmi; % predicted by height, weight, and sex) and mass-to-volume ratio. Associations were estimated in a propensity score-matched analysis. A total of 3113 participants (53% female; 40% european-american, 25% african-american, 22% hispanic-american, and 13% chinese-american) were eligible; 2431 returned for follow-up cmr imaging after a median of 9.4 years. Statin therapy (moderate dose, 76%) was started by 36% of participants (n = 872). We excluded 42 participants with incident myocardial infarction. Compared with nonuse, statin use was associated with less 10-year progression in lvmi (-2.35 percentage points; 95% ci, -4.24 to -0.47; p = .01) and mass-to-volume ratio (-0.03 absolute difference; 95% ci, -0.07 to -0.00; p = .02); effects were small in magnitude. A dose response was observed: higher statin dose was associated with less lvmi progression. In contrast to previous small studies, we found very modest associations between statin use and indices of left ventricular remodeling over 10 years in this prospective study of a diverse cohort.","29380457"

Online 1-week diary study of 1326 ibuprofen users. Nsaids were identified by list-based prompting; respondents were not required to know their medications were nsaids. Details of hourly use were recorded by respondents daily. Deviations from dosing directions were programmatically determined afterwards. An exit survey obtained information on demographics, medical history, physical and mental health status, attitudes regarding label reading and dosing behavior, and knowledge of product label instructions. Most diary users (90%) took over-the-counter ibuprofen during the week; 37% also took non-ibuprofen nsaids. Most did not recognize all products taken as nsaids. Edl occurred among 11% of users for ibuprofen, 4% of users for other nsaids, and on 9.1% of nsaid usage days. Edl was associated with deviations from detailed dosing directions, particularly exceeding the 1-time dose, which occurred more often with medications with 1-pill doses. Personal characteristics associated with edl included male sex, ongoing pain, poor physical function, daily smoking, having the attitudes of ""choosing my own dose"" and not starting with the lowest dose, and poor knowledge of the recommended 1-time and 24-hour doses. The prevalence of edl among nsaid users is nontrivial, and it is associated with potentially modifiable factors.

These studies are restricted to live births due to a reliance on algorithms for estimating gestational age that are based on codes associated with live delivery. Conditioning on live birth may induce selection bias when studying the effect of a drug on a pregnancy complication if fetal death is a competing risk for the complication or is caused by the complication. We simulated a population of 100,000 pregnancies and estimated the impact of selection bias on relative estimates for the effect of antidepressant exposure on the outcome of preeclampsia. We assumed that the exposure, outcome, and covariates increased the risk of fetal loss. A downward bias in the risk ratio was consistently observed when conditioning on live births. When an unmeasured covariate was assumed to be a common cause of fetal death, antidepressant use, and preeclampsia, the direction of bias varied depending on the strength of the confounding relationship coupled with the selection bias. Despite the very low prevalence of stillbirth, the strength of the relationship between antidepressant use and stillbirth had a substantial impact on bias. Conditioning on live birth can be problematic when studying pregnancy complications. Simple quantitative selection bias analysis in populations restricted to live births may not fully account for selection bias.","29341340"

We obtained records of prescribed opioid dispensings (2006-2015) subsidised under australia's pharmaceutical benefits scheme. We used dispensing claims to quantify annual changes in use according to 3 volume-based metrics: ddd/1000 pop/day, ome/1000 pop/day, and dispensings/1000 pop. We estimated the number of persons dispensed at least one opioid in a given year (persons)/1000 pop using data from a 10% random sample of pharmaceutical benefits scheme-eligible australians. Total opioid use increased according to all metrics, especially ome/1000 pop/day (51% increase) and dispensings/1000 pop (44%). Weaker opioid use remained stable or declined; strong opioid use increased. The rate of persons accessing weaker opioids only decreased 31%, and there was a 238% increase in persons dispensed only strong opioids. Strong opioid use also increased according to dispensings/1000 pop (140%), ome/1000 pop/day (80%), and ddd/1000 pop/day (71% increase). Our results suggest that the increases in total opioid use between 2006 and 2015 were predominantly driven by a growing number of people treated with strong opioids at lower medicine strengths/doses.

We investigated how the amount of pre and post approval exposure influences the detection of post-approval safety issues. A cohort of innovative drugs approved in europe was followed for the period of 2012-2016. The main outcome of interest was a new safety issue in the period.

For each study season, we obtained an average guillain-barré syndrome/seizures age-sex-adjusted rate from the 5 previous seasons and then used this rate to calculate the expected number of events, assuming a 42-day risk-window. Calculations were performed for detecting rate ratios of 1.5 to 10. We compared power and timeliness considering combinations of the presence/absence of delays in recording outcomes and in receiving data. The r-package sequential was used. In general, there was ≥80% power to detect increases in risk of ≥4 at the end of the season. Assuming absence of delays slightly improved power (a maximum increase of 4%) but did not noticeably reduce time to detect a signal. Removing delays in data availability is insufficient to significantly improve the performance of a nrtvss system using cprd. Expansion of cprd data is required. Key points the clinical practice research datalink (cprd) can be used to implement near real-time vaccine safety surveillance, but there is limited power to detect signals for rare outcomes. Delays in recording outcomes and in receiving data might limit power and timeliness of a system. We assessed the influence of these sources of delays to inform data providers of the steps required to improve a system using cprd data. Removing delays in recording outcomes and receiving data is unlikely to significantly improve the performance of a system using cprd data. Expansion of the data available is needed.","29193554"

However, little is known about prescription drug use for high-risk pregnancies. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of redeemed prescriptions in danish pregnant women with and without previous psychiatric history. A danish population-based descriptive study of 981 392 pregnancies ending in live-born singletons by 586 988 women aged 15 to 55 years between 1997 and 2012, of which 113 449 (11.6%) pregnancies were by women with a psychiatric history prior to the index pregnancy. All prescription drugs redeemed during pregnancy were identified, and dispensing patterns among the women were reported by therapeutic classes of drugs, calendar year of childbirth, and trimester. Overall, women with psychiatric history prior to pregnancy were more likely to fill a prescription (75.8%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 75.5-76.0%), compared with women with no psychiatric history (64.5%; 95% ci, 64.4-64.6%). The difference was observed even when psychotropic drug use was excluded and in all therapeutic classes except for antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs. The most commonly prescribed drugs were anti-infectives. Approximately 44.7% (95% ci, 44.5-45.0%) of women with psychiatric history and 31.3% (95% ci, 31.2-31.4%) of women with no psychiatric history redeemed more than one therapeutic class of drugs. Women with a psychiatric history were more likely to redeem prescriptions during pregnancy across almost all drug classes, especially anti-infectives. Two thirds of all women redeemed at least one prescription drug during pregnancy and one third more than one drug class. Key points we mapped prescription drug use of almost 600 000 women during almost one million pregnancies with focus on women with a history of psychiatric disorder before conception compared with women with no such history. Pregnant women with a previous psychiatric disorder were more likely to redeem prescription drugs compared with pregnant women without a previous psychiatric disorder. The observed overall difference was not due to obvious differences in psychotropic drug use. The difference was evident across calendar years, all trimesters, and almost all drug classes, but to a large extent in anti-infectives, among those mainly antibiotics. Two thirds of pregnant women redeemed prescription drugs during pregnancy, and one third redeemed more than one drug class. Health professionals should be aware of comorbid conditions requiring multiple drug use during pregnancy with the risk of unknown fetal effects.","29171114"

Drugs use were categorized as 0 to 1 drug (very low drug use), 2 to 4 drugs (low drug use), 5 to 9 drugs (polypharmacy), and 10 or more drugs (excessive polypharmacy). To assess whether or not prevalence of patients in relation to drug use distribution changed overtime, adjusted prevalence ratios (prs) was estimated with log-binomial regression models. Among 2120 patients recruited in 27 wards continuously participating to data collection, 1882 were discharged alive and included in this analysis. The proportion of patients with very low drug use (0-1 drug) at hospital discharge increased overtime, from 2.7% in 2010 to 9.2% in 2016. Results from a log-logistic adjusted model confirmed the increasing pr of these very low drug users overtime (particularly in 2014 vs 2012, pr 1.83 95% ci 1.14-2.95). Moreover, from 2010 to 2016, there was an increasing number of patients who, on polypharmacy at hospital admission, abandoned it at hospital discharge, switching to the very low drug use group.

However, there is an underlying continuous probability of exposure, and by insisting on a dichotomy, researchers unwillingly force a nondifferential misclassification into their analyses. We have recently developed a model whereby probability of exposure can be modeled, and we tested this on an empirical case of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid)-induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ugib). We used a case-controls data set, consisting of 3568 cases of severe ugib and 35 552 matched controls. Exposure to nsaid was based on 3 different conventional dichotomous measures. In addition, we tested 3 probabilistic exposure measures, a simple univariate backward-recurrence model, a ""full"" multivariable model, and a ""reduced"" multivariable model. Odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals for the association between nsaid use and ugib were calculated by conditional logistic regression, while adjusting for preselected confounders. Compared to the conventional dichotomous exposure measures, the probabilistic exposure measures generated adjusted ors in the upper range (4.37-4.75) while at the same time having the most narrow confidence intervals (ratio between upper and lower confidence limit, 1.46-1.50). Some ors generated by conventional measures were higher than the probabilistic ors, but only when the assumed period of intake was unrealistically short. The pattern of high ors and narrow confidence intervals in probabilistic exposure measures is compatible with less nondifferential misclassification of exposure than in a dichotomous exposure model. Probabilistic exposure measures appear to be an attractive alternative to conventional exposure measures.","29024218"

The clinical, public health, and economic impacts of pdmps must be evaluated, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. In addition to assessing patient outcomes, qualitative research should examine how clinicians use and interpret pdmp information.

We performed interrupted time-series analyses to estimate changes in new prescription rates and nested case-control studies to compare characteristics of new users before and after removal of a black triangle. Prescribing rates to the 33 441 new users of these new drugs were highest shortly after initial approval and declined subsequently; there were no increases in rates of new prescriptions after a black triangle's removal (new prescriptions/million/month postlabel: escitalopram -1.5 [95% ci, -1.9 to -1.2]; tadalafil and vardenafil: -0.1 [95% ci, -0.6 to 0.4]). Among drugs in the same class, loss of a patent had more impact on prescribing rates than loss of a black triangle. People who began taking black triangle drugs were less likely to be young or to have multiple comorbidities or recent hospitalization compared with those starting the same drugs after the label's removal. However, these differences generally reflected secular trends seen also in similar, unlabeled medicines. Accelerated drug approvals could cause more uncertainty about drug effectiveness and safety, but specific labeling of newly approved medicines is unlikely to promote more judicious prescribing.","28857309"

Community pharmacies in manitoba were invited to participate in a mail-out survey to identify the use of blister packaging for up to 25 patients who had a solid oral medication dispensed from april 1, 2012 to march 31, 2014. Eligible medications were identified using the population-based province-wide retail pharmacy network. Algorithms for identifying the use of blister packaging were determined by comparing the proportion of fills that confirmed blister pack use between different days supply quantities. Twenty-seven out of 32 pharmacies that agreed to participate completed the survey. The total number of prescriptions in the analysis was 2045 of which 131 (6.4%) were dispensed in blister packaging. Overall, prescriptions dispensed in days divisible by 7 yielded a 72.5% sensitivity, 86.6% specificity, 30.3% ppv, and 97.9% npv compared with prescriptions dispensed in other quantities. A 28-day to 30-day comparison yielded an 87.9% sensitivity, 96.1% specificity, 64.6% ppv, and 99.0% npv. While the npv was high, the ppv for identifying blister packaging using the days supply field in pharmacy claims data was modest given the low prevalence in blister pack use. The best predictor occurred when 28 days was compared with 30 days. Key points blister packs are arranged in 4 × 7 compartments and are often used to improve adherence, but no studies have examined whether it was possible to identify the use of blister packs using the days supply field in pharmacy claims data.

Reformulation of these products with abuse-deterrent properties is one approach for addressing this problem. Fda has approved several extended-release opioid analgesics with abuse-deterrent labeling, the bases of which come from pre-market studies. As all opioid analgesics must be capable of delivering the opioid in order to reduce pain, abuse-deterrent properties do not prevent abuse, nor do pre-market evaluations ensure that there will be reduced abuse in the community. Utilizing data from various surveillance systems, some recent post-market studies suggest a decline in abuse of extended-release oxycodone after reformulation with abuse-deterrent properties. We discuss challenges stemming from the use of such data. We quantify the relationship between the sample, the population, and the underlying sampling mechanism and identify the necessary conditions if valid statements about the population are to be made. The presence of other interventions in the community necessitates the use of comparators. We discuss the principles under which the use of comparators can be meaningful. Results based on surveillance data need to be interpreted with caution as the underlying sampling mechanisms can bias the results in unpredictable ways. The use of comparators has the potential to disentangle the effect due to the abuse-deterrence properties from those due to other interventions. However, identifying a comparator that is meaningful can be very difficult.","28833803"

Results indicate higher abuse for hydrocodone ir combination products than other opioid categories per 100 assessments but lower per prescriptions dispensed. Hydrocodone ir combination products had similar abuse prevalence to all extended-release and long-acting opioids when considering abuse measured per morphine milligram equivalents dispensed. An upward trend in hydrocodone ir combination product abuse was observed among adult substance abusers comparing the period prior to and after drug enforcement administration rescheduling of these products in october 2014. Most individuals reported oral abuse of hydrocodone ir combination products, but snorting, reported by 23% of hydrocodone ir combination product abusers, also appears to be a route of abuse that may have public health relevance. Given their high prescription volume, hydrocodone ir combination products, even at a relatively low prevalence of abuse, may contribute substantially to the overall problem of prescription opioid abuse.

Medications that are used occasionally, such as antibiotics, had a lower concordance (0.51). Women with a turkish or other non-western background were more likely to demonstrate discordance between pharmacy records and self-reported data compared with women with a dutch background (turkish: odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.29; other non-western: odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.71). Further research is needed to assess how the cultural or ethnic differences may affect the concordance or discordance between both medication sources. The results of this study showed that the use of multiple sources is needed to have a good estimation of the medication use during pregnancy.","28744981"

We analyzed serious safety issues appended to drug package inserts (pis) in japan in 2012. The issues were characterized according to drug class, adverse event, years since drug approval, initiator of regulatory actions, revised section of pi, and evidence source. We also quantified the durations from signal detection to tentative decision and from tentative decision to regulatory action. We identified 144 serious safety issues during the study period, and the majority of evidence originated from spontaneous reports (83.5%). The pmda initiated regulatory actions for half of all safety issues, and the median duration from drug approval to regulatory action was 8 years (interquartile range [iqr], 3-26.5 years). The median duration was 49 days (iqr, 0-362 days) from signal detection to tentative decision and 84 days (iqr, 63-136 days) from tentative decision to regulatory action. Several safety issues involving older drugs and multiple products had protracted decision-making durations. Most safety issues led to prompt regulatory actions predominantly based on spontaneous reports. Some safety issues that were not easily detected by the spontaneous reporting system were identified years after approval. In addition, several safety issues required assessments of multiple drug products, which prolonged the decision-making process.","28722235"

This paper presents a qualitative comparison of the 2 methods. We review and critically assess similarities and differences of sw and dce based on 6 aspects: comprehension by study participants, cognitive biases, sample representativeness, ability to capture heterogeneity in preferences, reliability and validity, and robustness of the results. The sw choice task can be more difficult, but the workshop context in which sw is conducted may provide more support to patients who are unfamiliar with the end points being evaluated or who have cognitive impairments. Both methods are similarly prone to a number of biases associated with preference elicitation, and dce is prone to simplifying heuristics, which limits its application with large number of attributes. The low cost per patient of the dce means that it can be better at achieving a representative sample, though sw does not require such large sample sizes due to exact nature of the collected preference data. This also means that internal validity is automatically enforced with sw, while the internal validity of dce results needs to be assessed manually. Choice between the 2 methods depends on characteristics of the benefit-risk assessment, especially on how difficult the trade-offs are for the patients to make and how many patients are available. Although there exist some empirical studies on many of the evaluation aspects, critical evidence gaps remain.","28696023"

This descriptive study identified and included all patients prescribed with antipsychotic in hong kong from 2004 to 2014 using the clinical data analysis and report system. This study calculated and reported the prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing in patient groups of interest, the percentage with diagnoses of mental disorders were derived, and the prevalence of antipsychotic by dosage forms. The study included 10 109 206 prescriptions of any antipsychotics to 256 903 patients. Over the study period, the prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing increased from 1.06% to 1.54% in the general population, from 0.10% to 0.23% in children (3-17 years old), and from 2.61% to 3.26% in older patients (≥65 years old). The prevalence of second-generation antipsychotics increased, but the prevalence of first-generation antipsychotics did not. Prevalence of antipsychotic prescribing in prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum timeframes varied from 0.18% to 0.38%. The percentage of incident prescriptions with a diagnosis of psychosis decreased from 54.1% to 47.5%. Antipsychotics have been increasingly prescribed in the general population, children, and older patients. There is an increase in second-generation antipsychotic prescribing. Over half of incident users had a recent diagnosis of a nonpsychotic mental disorder in 2014, suggesting that off-label prescribing of antipsychotics might be common.","28665012"

In this paper, we present a web application called codemapper, which assists in the mapping of case definitions to codes from different vocabularies, while keeping a transparent record of the complete mapping process. Codemapper builds upon coding vocabularies contained in the metathesaurus of the unified medical language system. The mapping approach consists of three phases. First, medical concepts are automatically identified in a free-text case definition. Second, the user revises the set of medical concepts by adding or removing concepts, or expanding them to related concepts that are more general or more specific. Finally, the selected concepts are projected to codes from the targeted coding vocabularies. We evaluated the application by comparing codes that were automatically generated from case definitions by applying codemapper's concept identification and successive concept expansion, with reference codes that were manually created in a previous epidemiological study. Automated concept identification alone had a sensitivity of 0.246 and positive predictive value (ppv) of 0.420 for reproducing the reference codes. Three successive steps of concept expansion increased sensitivity to 0.953 and ppv to 0.616. Automatic concept identification in the case definition alone was insufficient to reproduce the reference codes, but codemapper's operations for concept expansion provide an effective, efficient, and transparent way for reproducing the reference codes.","28657162"

In addition to disproportionate reporting patterns, it also accounts for the completeness, recency, and geographic spread of individual case reporting, as well as the availability of case narratives. Previous retrospective analysis suggested that vigirank performed better than disproportionality analysis alone. The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate its prospective performance. The evaluation of vigirank was based on real-world signal detection in vigibase. In may 2014, vigirank scores were computed for pairs of new drugs and who adverse reaction terminology critical terms with at most 30 reports from at least 2 countries. Initial manual assessments were performed in order of descending score, selecting a subset of drug-adverse drug reaction pairs for in-depth expert assessment. The primary performance metric was the proportion of initial assessments that were decided signals during in-depth assessment. As comparator, the historical performance for disproportionality- guided signal detection in vigibase was computed from a corresponding cohort of drug-adverse drug reaction pairs assessed between 2009 and 2013. During this period, the requirement for initial manual assessment was a positive lower endpoint of the 95% credibility interval of the information component measure of disproportionality, observed for the first time. 194 initial assessments suggested by vigirank's ordering eventually resulted in 6 (3.1%) signals.

Interrupted time series analyses were used to assess the impact of the 2004 black-box warning on the prescribing levels of ads. The 2004 black-box warning had a significant and immediate effect on the prescribing of ad. However, this drop was not sustained, and 5 years after the advisory ad prescribing rates reversed direction and started to rise. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors dominated as the most common ad prescribed throughout the study period, increasing from 66% prior to the black-box warning to 83.12% after 2009. The black-box warning effectively reduced ad prescribing in primary care for approximately 5 years before a reversal back to a positive rate of prescribing.

In this study, we aimed to document the aefis following the use of pentavalent vaccine recently introduced into the national programme on immunization and compare with those of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (dtwp) vaccine which it replaced. This was a retrospective cohort study on infants with at least 2 immunization visits who commenced immunization between june 2011 and may 2013 at the child welfare clinic of institute of child health, university of benin, nigeria.

Rates of gabapentin diversion per 100 000 population were calculated for each quarter from 2002 through 2015. Qualitative data are drawn from a brief questionnaire completed by a subsample of survey respondents and were organized and presented by theme. In total, 407 new cases of diverted gabapentin were reported during the time period, with diversion rates steadily increasing from zero cases in the first 2 quarters of 2002 to a high of 0.027 cases per 100 000 population in the fourth quarter of 2015. Qualitative data suggest that gabapentin is being misused in conjunction with prescription opioids and that gabapentin and heroin are being combined and consumed together.

The most accurate algorithm for men combined information from ltd status, outpatient anticancer drugs, radiotherapy sessions and primary or related discharge diagnosis of cancer, although it underestimated the cancer incidence (standardized incidence ratio (sir) 0.85 [0.80-0.90]). For women, the best algorithm used the same definition of the algorithm for men but restricted hospital discharge to only primary or related diagnosis with an additional inpatient procedure or drug reimbursement related to cancer and gave comparable estimates to those from registries (sir 1.00 [0.94-1.06]). The algorithms proposed could be used for cancer incidence monitoring and for future etiological cancer studies involving french healthcare databases.

These algorithms were evaluated against a validated bedside assessment, the confusion assessment method, and a validated delirium severity scale, the cam-s. Delirium occurred in 66 patients (36%), of which 14 (21%) had hyperactive or mixed features and 15 (23%) had severe delirium. Icd diagnosis codes for delirium were present in 15 patients (8%). Antipsychotics were used in 13 patients (7%). Icd diagnosis codes alone and antipsychotics use alone had comparable sensitivity (18% vs. 18%) and specificity (98% vs. 99%). Defining delirium using either icd diagnosis codes or antipsychotics use, sensitivity improved to 30% with little change in specificity (97%). This algorithm showed higher sensitivity for hyperactive or mixed delirium (64%) and severe delirium (73%). Requiring both icd diagnosis codes and antipsychotics use resulted in perfect specificity but low sensitivity (6%). Delirium-identification algorithms in claims data have low sensitivity and high specificity. Defining delirium using icd diagnosis codes or antipsychotics use performs better than considering either type of information alone. This information should inform the design and interpretation of claims-based comparative effectiveness and safety research. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.","28485014"

Each month of the study, more than 80 000 patients received a zolpidem-containing product and approximately one-tenth as many received eszopiclone. The two dscs did not affect the downward trajectory of new zolpidem prescriptions. However, there was an increase in use of lower-dose forms of zolpidem (30% increase, p < 0.001), coupled with a reduction in higher-dose forms (13% decrease, p = 0.03), so that the average dose decreased after the dscs (from 9.7 mg to 9.4 mg, p < 0.001), a change that was not seen with eszopiclone (from 2.74 mg to 2.74 mg, p = 0.45).

Children born to mothers who used β2aa during pregnancy were categorized as exposed, and all other children were included in the unexposed group. Cases of asds were identified from the danish psychiatric central register and the danish patient register. Incidence rate ratio (irr) and 95% confidence interval were estimated by poisson regression models. Among 751 888 children in the cohort, 9098 (1.21%) received a diagnosis of asds. We observed an increased risk of asds in the exposed children (irr = 1.28, 1.11-1.47), especially for those who were exposed during the second trimester period (irr = 1.38, 1.14-1.67).

Simulation studies have recommended expanding the look-back approach to all available data (aad) for binary indicators of diagnoses, procedures, and medications, but there have been few real data analyses using this approach. The objective of the study is to explore the impact on treatment effect estimates and covariate prevalence of expanding the look-back period within five validated studies in the aetion system, a rapid cycle analytics platform. We reran the five studies and assessed covariates using (i) a fixed window approach (usually 180 days before treatment initiation), (ii) aad prior to treatment initiation, and (iii) aad with a categorized by recency approach, where the most recent occurrence of a covariate was labeled as recent (occurring within the fixed window) or past (before the start of the fixed window). For each covariate assessment approach, we adjusted for covariates via propensity score matching. All studies had at least one covariate that had an increase in prevalence of 15% or higher from the fixed window to the aad approach. However, there was little change in treatment effect estimates resulting from differing covariate assessment approaches. For example, in a study of acute coronary syndrome in high-intensity versus low-intensity statin users, the estimated hazard ratio from the fixed window approach was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.98, 1.25) versus 1.21 (1.07, 1.37) when using aad and 1.19 (1.05, 1.35) using categorized by recency. Expanding the baseline period to aad improved covariate sensitivity by capturing data that would otherwise be missed yet did not meaningfully change the overall treatment effect estimates compared with the fixed window approach.

We selected 3331 beneficiaries (women: 2272; men: 559) for whom we requested 3625 medical records. Overall, we received 1738 [47.9% (95%ci 46.3%, 49.6%)] of the requested medical records. We observed small differences in the characteristics of the total population with aesis compared with those randomly selected for retrieval; however, no differences were seen between those selected and those retrieved. We retrieved 54.7% of records requested from hospitals compared with 26.3% of records requested from physician offices (p < 0.001). Retrieval did not differ by sex or vital status of the beneficiaries. Our national medical record validation study of claims-based algorithms produced a modest retrieval rate.

The cdars is a database developed by the hong kong hospital authority for research purpose. We used icd-9 code algorithm for identifying major osteoporotic fracture, including vertebral fracture, humerus fracture, forearm/wrist fracture, and hip fracture, in cdars in 2005-2016. As high positive predictive value (ppv) is critically important in epidemiology research, we sought to determine the ppv of fracture diagnostic code in terms of icd-9 relative to the radiography imaging and clinical notes. A total of 380 major osteoporotic fracture cases (vertebral fracture: 101 cases; humerus fracture: 81 cases; forearm/wrist fracture: 94 cases; and hip fracture: 104 cases) were randomly selected and validated. In 380 fracture cases, the overall ppv was 96.8%. In subgroup analysis, ppv of 100% was observed for hip, humerus, and forearm/wrist fractures, whereas ppv of 86% was observed for vertebral fracture. The use of icd-9 code algorithm to identify major osteoporotic fracture in cdars is a valid tool with a very high ppv.

From this cohort, 964 patients who experienced fracture were identified (i.e., cases). Up to five controls were randomly selected for each case from the underlying cohort. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the risk of fracture associated with adherence to statins, which was measured from the proportion of days covered (pdc) by treatment. A set of sensitivity analyses was performed in order to account for sources of systematic uncertainty. Compared with patients with low adherence (pdc ≤ 40%), those on intermediate (pdc 41-80%) and high (pdc > 80%) adherence exhibited a risk reduction of 21% (95% confidence interval 6% to 23%) and 25% (7% to 40%). Similar effects were observed among patients younger and older than 80 years, as well as among men, while there was no evidence that adherence to statins affected the risk of fracture among women.

A set of keywords flagged terms potentially indicative of abpa in free-text comments of patients' emrs to produce a grid on the basis of keywords' hit or miss. The grid was examined for occurrence and concurrence of keywords to discern patterns of concurrence potentially indicative of an underlying diagnosis of abpa. The analyses included 3 653 169 free-text items from 21 054 patients.

The study was performed in efemeris database (54 918 mother-children pairs). An estimation of adaptation to extrauterine life was assessed using several criteria especially cardio-respiratory symptoms. A proxy variable called ""neonatal pathology"" was created. The occurrence of this event was studied using two approaches: the standard method comparing exposed and unexposed newborns, the trajectory method comparing the different profiles of exposure. Around 5% of newborns (n = 2768) were identified to be exposed to anxiolytics or hypnotics during pregnancy. Using the standard method, 6.2% of exposed newborns developed a ""neonatal pathology"" against 4.8% of unexposed newborns (odds ratios [or] = 0.9[0.8-1.2], p = 0.7). With the trajectory method taking into account evolution of exposure during pregnancy and treatment intensity, four profiles of pregnant women were identified. A significant difference in the rates of ""neonatal pathologies"" was observed between profiles (p = 0.0002).

We compared antidepressant adherence among women with breast cancer to similar women without cancer using generalized estimation equations. Antidepressant adherence was estimated using the proportion of days covered 1 year before and after the index date. We included 1142 women with breast cancer and pre-existing depression and 1142 matched non-cancer patients with pre-existing depression. Mean antidepressant adherence was similar for both groups in the year before and after the index date (all around 0.71); adherence decreased by approximately 0.01 following breast cancer diagnosis in cancer group, with similar reductions among non-cancer group (p = 0.19). However, substantial proportion of patients had inadequate adherence to antidepressants in the post-diagnosis period, and almost 40% of patients in each group discontinued antidepressants over the study period.

Seventy-one percent of specialists agreed that they would prescribe biosimilars for all or some conditions meeting relevant clinical criteria. Specialists were less confident about indication extrapolation and switching patients from an existing biologic. Acceptance of biosimilars was significantly associated with a lower perceived time to explain a biosimilar to a patient and lower number of weekly patient appointments. The most common situations that they would not prescribe a biosimilar was where there was a lack of clinical data supporting efficacy (32%), or evidence of adverse effects (17%). Medical specialists held generally positive attitudes towards biosimilars but were less confident in indication extrapolation and switching patients from a biologic. Providing clinicians with guidance on how to explain biosimilars to patients and written patient material may help overcome some of the barriers to the use of biosimilars.

A retrospective cohort study using the general practice research database was carried out. Women aged 10-49 years at pregnancy start who received a prescription for a statin in the 3 months before and/or during the first trimester of pregnancy were matched to up to 10 pregnancies on age at start date, diabetes and hypertension status before pregnancy. Pregnancies occurring between 1/1/1992 and 31/3/2009 were included. Pregnancy losses were identified and categorised as spontaneous (including miscarriage), induced for medical, other or unknown reasons. Freetext was used to determine the type of loss where this was not clear from the coded medical records. Two hundred eighty-one pregnancies potentially exposed to statins were identified and matched to 2643 unexposed pregnancies. About 54.45% of pregnancies potentially exposed to a statin resulted in a delivery compared with 62.81% of those not exposed. 25.27% of all pregnancies potentially exposed to a statin resulted in a spontaneous loss compared with 20.81% in those not exposed. Using a time to event analysis with exposure as a time-dependent covariate gave an adjusted hazards ratio of 1.64 (95%ci 1.10 to 2.46) of spontaneous pregnancy loss in the statin exposed group. This study is the first to report the differences in types of pregnancy loss following the potential exposure to a statin just before or early in pregnancy.

This cohort study used data from a representative sample of the french national healthcare insurance system database. Patients hospitalised for an incident acs between 2006 and 2011 and aged ≥20 years at the time of acs were included in the study. Effectiveness in preventing the composite outcome acs, transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke or all-cause-death was estimated using time-fixed and time-dependent cox proportional hazards models with different definitions of exposure (at inclusion or determined daily during follow-up) and adjustment for patient characteristics, co-morbidities and co-medications. Of the 2874 patients included in the study, 33.9% were women; median age was 67 years (interquartile range: 56-77). The median duration of follow-up was 3.6 years (interquartile range: 2.2-5.3).

Incident hf events were identified using icd-9-cm code algorithms as the first observed hospitalization claim or the second of two hf outpatient claims occurring within 12 months. Using 36 months as a referent, the look-back period was reduced by 6-month increments. For each look-back period, we calculated the incidence rate, percent of prevalent hf events misclassified as incident, and loss in sample size.

We designed a cohort study using a pharmacy prescription database. Pregnant women were considered exposed when they received a prescription of ri-inducing drugs. These drugs could be either used alone (ri+/faa-) or combined with drugs exhibiting folic acid antagonism (faa, ri+/faa+). The reference group included pregnant women who did not receive any ri-inducing drugs or faa drugs. We analyzed 4116 exposed and 30 422 reference pregnancies. The hazard ratio (hr) with 95% confidence interval (ci) was 1.27 (95%ci 1.15-1.41) for pregnancies exposed to ri-inducing drugs as a whole. Considering subgroups of ri-inducing drugs, prenatal exposure to both ri+/faa+ and ri+/faa- was associated with the children's initiation of psychotropic medications, hrs being 1.35 (95%ci 1.10-1.66) and 1.26 (1.13-1.41), respectively. The hrs were increased with prolonged exposure to ri-inducing drugs, especially in the first and second trimesters. In a detailed examination of the psychotropics, the incidences of receiving antimigraine preparations and psychostimulants were significantly increased for the exposed children, compared with the reference children. The incidences of receiving antipsychotics and hypnotics were also higher for the exposed children; however, the hrs did not reach significance after adjustment. We found a significantly increased incident use of psychotropic medications among children prenatally exposed to ri-inducing drugs, especially during the first and second trimesters. This suggests a detrimental effect during critical periods of brain development. Copyright © 2017 john wiley & sons, ltd.","28097730"

Patients with drug-induced agranulocytosis from 1 january 2004 to 31 december 2013 were identified. World health organization causality assessment was used to evaluate the possible drug aetiology of each case. Odd ratios (ors) of the drug exposure were calculated using exact conditional logistic regression. A total of 155 cases of drug-induced agranulocytosis were identified. Mean age was 51.4 years, and 95 cases were female. Incidence rate was estimated to be 2.2 cases per million person-years, and the all-cause mortality of patients with drug-induced agranulocytosis was 3.9%.

The objective of this investigation is to assess consistency in the relative abuse ratios (rars) across different approaches for adjusting for drug availability. For the years 2004 through 2010, rars for each of four prescription opioids (hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, and morphine) were calculated using negative binomial regression. Measures of abuse (outcome) were misuse/abuse-related emergency department visits obtained from the drug abuse warning network. Measures of drug availability (offsets) were drug utilization estimates obtained from ims health. Separate regression models were run using each of five measures of drug utilization: unique patients (urdd), prescriptions dispensed (rx), tablets dispensed (td), kilograms (kgs) sold, and morphine-equivalents (mes) of kilograms sold. These results were compared for consistency. Aside from oxycodone-combination products, across molecules, rars adjusted by rxs, tds, and urdds were generally similar to each other while rars adjusted by kgs and mes were different. For example, compared to hydrocodone, oxycodone had statistically significantly increased rars of 3.6 (95%ci: 2.0-6.5), 3.5 (95%ci: 1.9-6.4), and 2.7 (95%ci: 1.5-5.0) when adjusted by urdds, rxs, and tds, respectively, but not when adjusted by kgs or mes.

Associations between sample and use of pims were examined by logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, and ward. We established pearsons r for correlations between numbers of drugs and pims. Altogether, 4373 patients (mean age 85.7 years, 73.5% women) were included. The mean overall number of drugs per patient increased from 4.7 in 1997 to 6.9 in 2011 (p < 0.001).

Use of codeine-analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, long-acting benzodiazepines, and first generation antihistamines decreased significantly, while use of short-acting benzodiazepines, z-hypnotics, statins, and anti-dementia drugs increased significantly. A moderate strong correlation was detected between number of drugs and the three above-mentioned pim categories, r = 0.34, r = 0.43, r = 0.37, respectively (all p < 0.001). Although several pims were less commonly prescribed in recent years, increased overall use of pims may suggests worsening of prescribing quality for nursing home patients in norway.

Most deaths (115/139) occurred in patients taking asa for secondary prevention. In these patients, mortality tended to be lower among asa continuer periods (hr: 0.74; 95%ci: 0.34-1.62) and higher among discontinuer periods (hr: 1.37; 95%ci: 0.81-2.30) than among non-users. Current use of clopidogrel was associated with decreased mortality in this population (hr: 0.49; 95%ci: 0.28-0.86). Asa therapy for secondary prevention should continue after ugib because the risk of death tends to increase when asa is stopped. However, a significantly increased risk was not found in these patients, likely owing to the relatively small number of asa users and deaths that occurred during follow-up.

One of the two measures applied an updated approach linking specific atc codes of dispensed drugs to 22 ccs; the other used a list of 37 drug categories, without linking them to specific ccs. Using logistic regressions that took repeated measures into account and hospitalization and/or death the following year as the outcome, we assigned weights to each cc/drug category. Comorbidity scores were calculated as the weighted sum of the 22 ccs/37 drug categories. We compared the performance of both measures in predicting hospitalization and/or death with that of a diagnosis-based score based on 30 groups of long-term illnesses (ltis), a status granted in france to exempt beneficiaries with chronic diseases from copayments. We assessed the predictive performance of the scores with the quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion (qic), the c statistic and the brier score. The two pharmacy-based scores performed better than the lti score, with lower qic and brier scores and higher c statistics. Their predictive performance was very similar.

The odds ratios within 0-1, 2-7, 8-14, and 15-30 days of dtwp administration were 1.18, 0.26, 0.50, and 0.77. In the 1996-2013 self-controlled case series studies, this temporal shift between dtwp and suid was consistently observed for female (incidence rate ratio 1.70, 0.75, 1.01, and 0.84) but not male or dtap recipients. A pooled analysis showed significant risk within 2 days of receiving dtwp in female infants (incidence rate ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.60). Being unvaccinated and recent receipt of dtwp in female infants was significantly associated with suid; the latter was consistent with a temporal shift pattern without overall increase in risk. The currently used pertussis vaccine, dtap, did not increase risk of suid. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.","27891698"

This confers a risk of reverse causation bias in studies of cancer risk associated with drug use, as early symptoms of a yet undiagnosed cancer might lead to drug treatment in the period leading up to the diagnosis. This bias can be alleviated by disregarding exposure for some time before the cancer diagnosis (lag time). We aimed at assessing the duration of lag time needed to avoid reverse causation bias. We identified all danish patients with incident cancer between 2000 and 2012 (n = 353 087). Incident use of prescription drugs was assessed prior to their cancer diagnosis as well as among population controls (n = 1 402 400). Analyses were conducted for all cancers and for breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer individually. Further, analyses were performed for a composite measure of all incident drug use as well as for nine pre-specified individual drug classes, representing drug treatment likely to be prescribed for symptoms of the given cancers. The incidence rate for new drug treatment among cancer cases was stable around 130 per 1000 persons per month until 6 months prior to cancer diagnosis where it increased gradually and peaked at 434 in the month immediately preceding the cancer diagnosis. Considerable variation was observed among cancers, for example, breast cancer showed almost no such effect. The pre-selected drug classes showed a stronger increase prior to cancer diagnoses than drugs overall. Incident use of drugs increases in the months prior to a cancer diagnosis. To avoid reverse causation, 6 months' lag time would be sufficient for most drug-cancer associations. © 2016 the authors.

A case/non-case disproportionality analysis of the vigibase® individual case safety reports (icsrs) of patients treated for tb using multidrug regimens that contain either of streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin or capreomycin. Cases were reports of ototoxicity; non-cases were other adverse drug reactions (adrs). The unit of analysis was the drug-adr pair. We calculated reporting odds ratios (rors) and their 95% confidence intervals (ci). The referent drug was streptomycin. By june 2014, there were 3361 drug-adr pairs in vigibase® (1693 icsrs) where the parenteral administration of the four drugs for tb treatment was suspected of causing the reported adrs. Deafness, tinnitus and vertigo were reported in 576 drug-adr pairs (cases), the rest being other adrs (non-cases). Reporting of deafness was most disproportionately associated with amikacin use (ror 9.3; 95%ci 3.8-23.0), followed by kanamycin use (ror 4.3; 95%ci 1.3-14.2). Reporting of vertigo was inversely associated with capreomycin use (ror 0.1; 95%ci 0.01-0.4). Geographic region affected the reporting of ototoxicity while age and sex did not. Spontaneous reporting of deafness cases within vigibase® was most disproportionately associated with amikacin use, followed by kanamycin. There were regional variations in the global reporting of ototoxicity. These findings should be verified through a follow up study. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.","27868278"

We conducted an interrupted time series population-level cohort study at group health (gh), between january 2006 and september 2014, comparing mvc risk among cot patients who were gh members receiving care in either group practice or contracted care settings. Group practice cot risk reduction initiatives were implemented in two phases: (1) altered prescribing expectations and (2) multifaceted initiatives. These initiatives did not exist in the contracted care network. We compared the adjusted quarterly rate of mvc between group practice and contracted care patients over time using a modified poisson regression model for a binary outcome. A total of 32 691 cot patients (27.4% from contracted care) met eligibility criteria and experienced a total of 1956 mvcs during study follow-up (mean, 8.1 quarters per person), of which 810 were serious injury crashes. Crash rates were not significantly different between the patient groups within any of the time periods. Analyses stratified by concurrent prescription of a sedative hypnotic or benzodiazepine found no significant difference between the group practice and contracted care patients. There was a modest elevation of mvc risk for high-dose patients relative to former cot patients who stopped receiving opioids. The risk of mvc was not mitigated in a large cohort of cot patients exposed to a health plan policy initiative that substantially lowered mean opioid dose.

However, the effects of generic drugs in acute and severe illness remain controversial. This study aims to investigate treatment costs and outcomes of generic antibiotics prescribed for adults with a urinary tract infection in outpatient settings. The data source was the longitudinal health insurance database of taiwan. We included outpatients aged 20 years and above with a urinary tract infection who required one oral antibiotic for which brand-name and generic products were simultaneously available. Drug cost and overall healthcare expense of the index consultation, healthcare cost during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were the main dependent variables. Data were compared between brand-name and generic users from the entire cohort and a propensity score-matched samples. Results from the entire cohort and propensity score-matched samples were similar. Daily antibiotic cost was significantly lower among generic users than brand-name users. Significant lower total drug claims of the index consultation only existed in patients receiving the investigated antibiotics, while the drug price between brand-name and generic versions were relatively large (e.g., >50%). The overall healthcare cost of the index consultation, healthcare expenditure during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were similar between the two groups. Compared with those treated with brand-name antibiotics, outpatients who received generic antibiotics had equivalent treatment outcomes with lower drug costs. Generic antibiotics are effective and worthy of adoption among outpatients with simple infections indicating oral antibiotic treatment. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.","27862588"

These methods often require iteration and post-calibration to achieve covariate balance. In comparison, entropy balance (eb) optimizes covariate balance a priori by calibrating weights using the target's moments as constraints. We measured covariate balance empirically and by simulation by using absolute standardized mean difference (asmd), absolute bias (ab), and root mean square error (rmse), investigating two scenarios: the size of the observed (exposed) cohort exceeds the target (unexposed) cohort and vice versa. The empirical application weighted a commercial health plan cohort to a nationally representative national health and nutrition examination survey target on the same covariates and compared average total health care cost estimates across methods. Entropy balance alone achieved balance (asmd ≤ 0.10) on all covariates in simulation and empirically. In simulation scenario i, eb achieved the lowest ab and rmse (13.64, 31.19) compared with ipw (263.05, 263.99) and sipw (319.91, 320.71). In scenario ii, eb outperformed ipw and sipw with smaller ab and rmse. In scenarios i and ii, eb achieved the lowest mean estimate difference from the simulated population outcome ($490.05, $487.62) compared with ipw and sipw, respectively. Empirically, only eb differed from the unweighted mean cost indicating ipw, and sipw weighting was ineffective. Entropy balance demonstrated the bias-variance tradeoff achieving higher estimate accuracy, yet lower estimate precision, compared with ipw methods. Eb weighting required no post-processing and effectively mitigated observed bias and confounding. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.","27859943"

A cross-sectional study repeated yearly was conducted using data from the french national healthcare insurance system. New benzodiazepine users were defined as users without any benzodiazepine dispensing in the year prior to the first dispensing of benzodiazepine in each year. Relative changes in incidence of use were calculated with the year 2006 as reference; confidence intervals for changes were estimated using the bootstrap method. Over the study period, the incident use of benzodiazepines decreased from 6.2% to 5.9%; this corresponded to a 5.1% decrease (95%ci: -6.8% to -4.2%) for 2012 compared to 2006. The decrease mainly concerned hypnotics (-15.5%; -21.2% to -15.3%) and appeared more pronounced in people aged 18-44 years. Incident use of anxiolytics remained stable overall during the period (4.0% of the population). Within anxiolytics, incident use of long half-life benzodiazepines (bromazepam, prazepam) decreased in favor of short half-life benzodiazepines (alprazolam, oxazepam). This change concerned patients aged 65-79 and patients aged 80 years and over. Nevertheless, in 2012, nearly one third of incident users aged 65 years and over started a treatment with a long half-life benzodiazepine, mostly bromazepam. A limited decrease in incident benzodiazepine use was observed in france between 2006 and 2012 that concerned only hypnotics. Although congruent with recommendations, this improvement appears insufficient with regard to the level of exposure to these drugs in france. New actions especially targeting anxiolytic benzodiazepine use should be undertaken to consolidate these results. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.","27807907"

Refinements to safety monitoring processes and infrastructure are also discussed. The study results are outside the remit of this paper. The results of the copd study were published recently and a more in-depth exploration of the safety results will be the subject of future publications. The sls used a linked database system to capture relevant data from primary care practices in salford and south manchester, two university hospitals and other national databases. Patient data were collated and analysed to create daily summaries that were used to alert a specialist safety team to potential safety events. Clinical research teams at participating general practitioner sites and pharmacies also captured safety events during routine consultations. Confidence in the safety monitoring processes over time allowed the methodology to be refined and streamlined without compromising patient safety or the timely collection of data. The information technology infrastructure also allowed additional details of safety information to be collected. Integration of multiple data sources in the sls may provide more comprehensive safety information than usually collected in standard randomised controlled trials.

We applied conditional logistic regression to examine how likely it was for each adr to be included in a boxed warning. There were substantial differences in all sections of the labels. The concordance rate between us and japanese labels was 44.1% for serious adverse reactions and 30.5% for boxed warnings. Our regression analysis indicated that deaths and/or terminations related to specific adrs reported in clinical trials were significantly associated with inclusion of the adr in boxed warnings in japan, but not in the us. The boxed warnings of similar drugs seemed to affect those of follow-on drugs in both countries. Us drug labels were likely to influence japanese labels, but not vice versa. This study suggests that the observed differences are not solely due to differences in clinical outcomes between the two countries, but rather due to differences in regulatory considerations and historical factors in both local and global contexts.

Our results demonstrated that both er and ir opioids were frequently abused by those with an opioid use disorder in terms of lifetime (91.0% vs. 98.7%, respectively) or past month (46.1% vs. 67.4%, respectively) abuse, but given the choice, only 4% of the sample selected er compounds as their preferred formulation. The remainder had no preference (29.9%) or a distinct preference for ir formulations (66.1%), regardless of route of administration-oral or non-oral (smoking/snorting or injecting). This preference for ir formulations seems to be related to: (i) the perceived immediacy and quality of the high (73.0%) from ir products; and (ii) they were easier to use, particularly when manipulated for non-oral abuse, than er products (31.2%). Based on these results, while most abusers have experience with both formulations, there is a greater preference for ir formulations, compared to er, regardless of route of administration. As a result, it may not be unreasonable to suggest that supply-side initiatives to restrict the diversion and abuse of prescription opioids may be just as important for both ir and er opioids.

We plotted the monthly proportion of these prescriptions that complied with components of four specific safety alerts or directives for these substances issued by the vha or fda between 1/1/2001 and 12/31/2008. We modeled compliance using interrupted time series analysis and a generalized additive model with the addition of an indicator variable to flag prescriptions that followed the directive's release date. A total of 32.2 million new prescriptions for fentanyl, oxycodone cr, and propoxyphene were written for vha patients meeting inclusion criteria. Compliance with guidelines in the directives increased steadily throughout the entire study period, with no clinically meaningful inflection point near the date of each directive's release. Generalized additive modeling and interrupted time series analysis found that the indicator flag slightly improved the fit of the data, but visual inspection of the plots revealed no change at a level of practical significance. While prescribing compliance increased throughout the period, release of fda and vha alerts and guidelines did not appear to contribute to this change. Given the fivefold increase in the rate of drug-related overdose deaths since 1990, identifying effective methods to communicate safety messages and change prescriber behavior remains a priority for future work.

Excluding studies with possible bias because of reverse causation or stratifying on study design did not affect the results. No protective effect was observed among the four studies that adjusted for either cholesterol of hyperlipidemia (relative risk 0.91; 95%ci 0.68 to 1.22). The effect estimate for studies that adjusted for cholesterol was 1.04 (95%ci 0.68 to 1.59) when a study with immortal time bias was excluded. The apparent protective effect of statins on risk of pd is at least partially explained by confounding by statin indication. Immortal time bias and healthy user effects also could have contributed to biased results. Copyright © 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.","27527987"
